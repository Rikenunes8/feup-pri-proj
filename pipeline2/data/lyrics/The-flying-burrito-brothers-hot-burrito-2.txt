Yes, you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you but that's the way that it goes
So it goes, yes, you know how I feel
So it goes, it just couldn't be real
And we know it's wrong
And I don't think it's gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
I've been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you don't want another fight
But you better love, find some love
You better love me, Jesus Christ
Yes, you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you, baby, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes, I guess you know how I feel
So it goes, yes, it couldn't be real
And you want me home all night
You just don't want another fight
But you better love, find some love
Love me baby, Jesus Christ
