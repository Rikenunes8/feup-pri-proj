[Verse 1]
It's a fire
These dreams that pass me by
This salvation I desire
Keeps getting me down
'Cause we need to
Recognize mistakes
For time and again
[Chorus]
So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, sister, breathe on
[Verse 2]
From this oneself
Testify or tell
It's fooling us now
[Chorus]
So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, little sister, breathe on
Ah, so breathe on, little sister, like a fool
