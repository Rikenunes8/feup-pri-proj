[Verse 1]
Turning back ten thousand years
It's all a blur where the taxis go
Monster man, a willing friend
Lucy serves the melon cold
[Pre-Chorus]
Vi-vi-violent and delicious souls
Oh-oh-oh, four red trucks dressed illegally
Mother knows how the bugle blows
Gonna get caught, gonna get caught
Gonna get caught in her rug, babe
[Chorus]
This is not a conclusion
No revolution
Just a little confusion
On where your head has been
[Verse 2]
Boats made out of paper float
Dreams made up for the banana king, darling
Crumbs you have lapped freely of
Devious we all have been
[Pre-Chorus]
Vi-vi-violent and delicious souls
Vi-vi-violent and delicious souls
[Chorus]
This is not a conclusion
No revolution
Just a little confusion
On where your head has been
