It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
[Chorus]
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes, when you were loving me, baby
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you
She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see
[Chorus]
She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois
[Chorus]
