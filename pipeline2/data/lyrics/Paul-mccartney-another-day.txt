[Verse 1]
Every day, she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day
[Verse 2]
At the office where the papers grow, she takes a break
Drinks another coffee, and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day
[Chorus]
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
[Bridge]
So sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment, she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah, stay, don't stand her up
And he comes, and he stays, but he leaves the next day
So sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
[Verse 3]
As she posts another letter to The Sound of Five
People gather around her, and she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day
[Chorus]
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
[Bridge]
So sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment, she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah, stay, don't stand her up
And he comes, and he stays, but he leaves the next day
So sad
Sometimes she feels so sad[Verse 1]
Every day, she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day
[Chorus]
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
