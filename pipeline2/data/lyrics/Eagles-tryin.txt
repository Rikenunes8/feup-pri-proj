[Verse]
I'm just arriving in the city
And there's music on my mind
Looking for my destination and
My home is far behind
Cause it's a long road ahead
And you can make it in the end
And I'm going to make it with my friends
And I'm trying
It took me sometime to see it
Now I'm looking through this world
And it's going to take some time before
I get back, help me girl
Cause you can make it if you try
You got to lay it on the line
And everything will be fine if you try
Sitting smoking just a thinking
Is an easy thing to do
We got to keep on trying for
The feeling to come through
And it's a lonely way to live
You got to take it, you got to give
If you mistake it, just try again
And I'm trying, yeah!
Got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Yeah I'm trying[etc]
