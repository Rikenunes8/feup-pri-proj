[Intro]
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
[Verse 1]
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of fooling around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down to the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want to settle down
[Chorus]
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just want to tell you that I wanna with you
(Baby, if you do too)
And baby if you do too
Forever, forever, baby I want you forever
I want to keep you for the rest of my life
(You can make right)
All that is wrong in my world
(You are my savior)
You can make right
(You are my light)
You are my savior, you are my light
(Forever I want you in my life)
Forever I want you in my life
[Refrain]
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da
[Verse 2]
(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey
(Don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid to walk on his own
(I'm at that road)
I'm here to tell you that I'm at that road
(I'd rather walk it with)
And I'd rather walk it
(You than walk it alone)
With you than walk it alone
(You are my future)
You are my hero, you are my future
(No past)
When I am with you, I have no past
Oh baby my one and only desire
(Make this feeling last)
Is find some way in this dog gone world
(Sugar, it's true)
To make this feeling last
(I know I do)[Chorus]
Oh baby it's true, I know I do
(To with you)
And I just want to tell you that
I want to with you, yeah
And baby if you do too
Forever, forever, I want you baby, baby forever
(You can make right)
I want to keep you for the rest of my life
(You are my savior)
All that is wrong in my world
(You are my light)
You can make right
(Forever I want you in my life)
You are my savior, you are my light
(La da da da da da da da)
Forever I want you in my life
(La da da da da da da da)
[Refrain]
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da
[Outro]
Forever in my life
Forever in my life
