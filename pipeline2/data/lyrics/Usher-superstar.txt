[Intro]
This is for you, you, my number one
This is for you, you, my number one
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
This is for you, you, my number one
[Verse 1]
Spotlights (Spotlights), big stage
Fifty thousand fans screamin' in a rage
Bodyguards (Bodyguards) and limousines
This is the way I see you in my dreams
Paparazzi flash, a hundred pictures, all of you
Hangin' on my bedroom wall
I'm a kid again, I feel like thirteen
But I knew since we fell in love, girl, I'd be
[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie, baby (Oh, whoa)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph
Sign it right here on my heart (I'll be)
Girl, I'll be your groupie, baby (Oh, oh, whoa)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah)
And as your number one fan
(This is for you, you, my number one)
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are
[Verse 2]
Front row (Front row), there I am
Jumpin' and hollerin', wavin' both hands
Would you notice me (Notice me), little me?
Drove twelve hours, girl, just to see
Your pretty face one more time
(Bought my ticket, I was first in line)
This is a metaphor to show how I adore, you (I adore you)
Baby, I do
[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie, baby (Whoa)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph (Autograph)
Sign it right here on my heart (Sign it right here, sugar)
Girl, I'll be your groupie, baby (Whoa)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah)
And as your number one fan
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are[Bridge]
(Girl, you know how I feel)
You're truly special, your love is legendary to me
(Without you, my life stands still)
I'll never leave your world, treat you like a diva, girl
You're one of (Girl, you're one of a kind)
'Cause they don't make 'em like you anymore, so
(So, I'll be your fan for life)
I dedicate this to my superstar for all time
[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie, baby (I'll be your groupie, baby)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph (Yeah, yeah)
Sign it right here on my heart
Girl, I'll be your groupie, baby (I'll be your groupie, baby)
