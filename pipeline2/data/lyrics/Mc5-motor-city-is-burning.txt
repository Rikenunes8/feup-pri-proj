Ya know, the Motor City is burning babe
There ain't a thing in the world that they can do
Ya know, the Motor City is burning people
There ain't a thing that white society can do
Ma home town burning down to the ground
Worser than Vietnam
Let me tell you how it started now ...
It started on 12th and Clairmount that morning
It made the beat cops all jump and shout
Ah said, it started on 12th and Clairmount that morning
It made the pigs in the street freak out
The fire wagons kept comin', baby
But the Black Panther snipers wouldn't let them put it out, wouldn't let them put it out, wouldn't let them put it out
[Guitar solo]
Get it on ...
Well, there were fire bombs bursting all around, people
Ya know there were soldiers standing everywhere
I said there was fire bombs bursting all around me, baby
Ya know there was National Guard everywhere
Ah can hear my people screaming
Sirens fill the air, fill the air, fill the air
[Guitar solo]
Your mama papa don't know what the trouble is
You see, they don't know what it's all about
Ah said, your mama, papa don't know what the trouble is, baby
They just can't see what it's all about
I get the news, read the newspapers, baby?
You just get out there in the street and check it out!
[Guitar solo]
Ah said, the Motor City is burning, people
I ain't hanging round to fight it out
Ah said, the Motor City is burning, people
Just not hang around to fight it outWell, I'm taking my wife and my people and they're on TV
Well, just before I go, baby, ????
Fireman's on the street, people all around
Now, I guess it's true
I'd just like to strike a match for freedom myself
I may be a white boy, but I can be bad, too
Yes, it's true now, yes, it's true now
[Guitar ending]
Let it all burn! Let it all burn!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes
Come on baby! Come on baby!
