[Verse 1]
You need meat, go to the market
You need bread, try the bakery
If you need love, baby
Don't go no further
Just come on home with me
[Chorus]
I got to love somebody[x3]
I want somebody, to love me
[Verse 2]
You need grits, go to the grocery
You need fish, go to the sea
You need love, baby
Don't look no further
Just come on home with me
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
You need money, go to the bank dear
You need honey, look for the bees
You need love, baby
Don't go no further
Just come on home with me[Chorus]
[Chorus]
I got to love somebody[x5]
I want somebody, to love me
