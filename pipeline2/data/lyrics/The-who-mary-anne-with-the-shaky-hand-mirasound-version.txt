[Verse 1]
I've danced with Linda
I've danced with Jean
I've danced with Cindy
And then I suddenly see
[Chorus]
Mary Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
[Verse 2]
Linda's got looks
Jean reads books
Cindy can sew
But I'd rather know
[Chorus]
Mary Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
[Bridge]
Mary is so pretty
The prettiest in the land
Guys come from every city
Just to shake her shaky hands
[Verse 3]
I wave at Linda (I wave at Linda)
I wave at Jean (I wave at Jean)
I wave at Cindy (Mary waves at me)
Mary waves at me
[Chorus]
Mary Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands[Verse 4]
I've danced with Linda
I've danced with Jean
I've danced with Cindy
And then I suddenly see
[Chorus]
Mary Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
[Chorus]
Mary Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
