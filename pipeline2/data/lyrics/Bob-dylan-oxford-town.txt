[Verse 1]
Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
Hey, we're going down to Oxford Town
[Verse 2]
He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town
[Verse 3]
Oxford Town around the bend
Come to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?
[Verse 4]
Me, my girl, my girl’s son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don’t even know why we come
Going back where we come from
[Verse 5]
Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon
