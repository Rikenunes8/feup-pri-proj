[Verse 1]
We're buying and selling your history
How we go about it is no mystery
We check it with the city then change the law
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you looking forward?
Now you want some more
[Chorus]
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
[Verse 2]
It's easy when you've got all the information
Inside help, no investigation, 
investigation, investigation
No questions in the house, no give and take
[Pre-Chorus]
There's a big bang in the city
We're all on the make
[Chorus]
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
[Bridge]
Our gain is your loss
That's the price you pay
I heard it in the House of Commons
Everything's for sale
We're shopping
We're shopping
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping[Outro]
We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shopping
