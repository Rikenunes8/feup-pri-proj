Once I walked through the halls of a station
Someone called your name
In the streets I heard children laughing
They all sound the same
Wonder could you ever know me
Know the reason why I live?
Is there nothing you can show me?
Life seems so little to give
Once I climbed up the face of a mountain
And ate the wild fruit there
Fell asleep until the moonlight woke me
And I could taste your hair
Isn't everybody dreaming?
Then the voice I hear is real
Out of all the idle scheming
Can't we have something to feel?
Once upon a time leaves me empty
Tomorrow never came
I could sing the sound of your laughter
Still I don't know your name
Must be some way to repay you
Out of all the good you gave
If a rumor should delay you
Love seems so little to say
