[Verse 1]
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try?
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
"The shallow drowned lose less than we," you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
"And we shall be together
We shall be together"
[Verse 2]
"Kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me"
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And laughing, break against your feet
And laughing, break the mirror sweet
"So we shall be together
So we shall be together"
[Verse 3]
"Kiss me goodbye," pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now, and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see, and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently
My hands, before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
[Chorus]
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
And we shall be together
