Sane, sane, they're all insane
The fireman's blind, the conductor's lame
A Cincinnati jacket and a sad luck dame
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
Moon in the window and a bird on the pole
We can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Said steam, steam, a hundred bad dreams
Goin' up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty dollar bill inside of Paladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker
's at

Shine, shine a Roosevelt dime
All the way to Baltimore and runnin' out of time
The Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole
They all went to Heaven in a little row boat
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Oh, clap hands
Oh, clap hands
Oh, clap hands
Clap hands
