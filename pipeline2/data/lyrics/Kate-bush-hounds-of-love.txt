[Intro]
"It's in the treesâ€”It's coming!"
[Verse 1]
When I was a child, running in the night
Afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark, hiding in the street
And of what was following me
[Pre Chorus 1]
(Do-do, do-do, do, do)
Now hounds of love are hunting
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've always been a coward
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I don't know what's good for me
[Chorus 1]
Oh, here I go
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be
Two steps on the water
[Verse 2]
I found a fox, caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I'm ashamed of running away
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
I'm still afraid to be there
[Pre Chorus 2]
(Do, do-do, do, do)
Among your hounds of love
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I feel your arms surround me
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've always been a coward
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
And never know what's good for me[Chorus 2]
Oh, here I go, don't let me go
Hold me down
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, darling, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be two steps on the water
(Do, do-do, do, do)
[Outro]
I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
Yeah-yo, Yeah-yo, your love
(Do-do, do)
Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake
Do you know what I really need?
Do you know what I really need?
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
