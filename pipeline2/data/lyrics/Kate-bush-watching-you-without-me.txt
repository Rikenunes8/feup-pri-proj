[Chorus 1]
You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't hear what I am
You can't hear what I am to you
[Verse 1]
You watch the clock move the slow hand
I should have been home hours ago
But I'm not here
But I'm not here
[Chorus 2]
You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't hear me
Here in the room with you now
You can't hear what I'm saying
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?
[Verse 2]
Can't let you know what's been happening
There's a ghost in our home just watching you without me
But I'm not here
But I'm not here
But I'm not here
[Chorus 3]
You don't hear me
You can't hear what I am
[Bridge 1]
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long[Bridge 2]
We... 
we see.
..
We see... we, we see... we, we see...
We see... we, we see... we, we see...
We, we see...
[Chorus 4]
You don't hear me come in
Help me, baby, help me, baby, talk to me! Listen to me, baby
Listen to me, listen to me, talk to me, baby, help...
You can't hear me
Listen, baby, listen to me, baby, help me, help me, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, please, baby, talk to me
You won't hear me leaving
