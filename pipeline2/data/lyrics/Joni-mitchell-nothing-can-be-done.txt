[Verse 1]
Must I forgive you each time?
And say you don't know what you're doing
There are no victimless crimes I know of
Out here in these graffiti ruins, my love
[Chorus]
Oh I am not old, I'm told, but I am not young
Oh, and nothing can be done
Don't start, my heart is a smoking gun
Oh, and nothing can be done
[Refrain]
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
[Verse 2]
I heard you leaving late last night
I heard you screaming down the mountain
Like you were running red lights
You had some trashcan rock band pounding
[Chorus]
I am not old, I'm told, but I am not young
Oh, and nothing can be done
Don't start, my heart is a smoking gun
Oh, and nothing can be done
[Refrain]
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
[Verse 3]
Must I surrender with grace
The things I loved when I was younger?
Sweet embrace, must I remember your face so well?
What do I do here with this hunger?[Chorus]
I am not old, I'm told, but I am not young
Oh, and nothing can be done
Don't start, my heart is a smoking gun
Oh, and nothing can be done
[Refrain]
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Oh, nothing can be done
