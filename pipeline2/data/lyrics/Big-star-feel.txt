[Verse 1]
Woman, what are you doing?
You're driving me to ruin
The love that you've been stealing
Has given me a feeling
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm dying
I'm never gonna live again
You just ain't been trying
It's getting very near the end
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm dying
I'm never gonna live again
You just ain't been trying
It's getting very near the end
[Verse 2]
Woman, what are you doing?
You're driving me to ruin
The love that you've been stealing
Has given me a feeling
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm dying
I'm never gonna live again
You just ain't been trying
It's getting very near the end
[Outro]
I feel like I'm dying
I feel like I'm dying
