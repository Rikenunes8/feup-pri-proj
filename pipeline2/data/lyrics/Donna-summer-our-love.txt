[Verse-1]
Dropping you this line to give you peace
And to set your weary mind at ease
I know that it's rough when you're so far away
Listen to the words I have to say
[Hook]
Sometimes when you're gone, I don't know why
Find the simple need to sit and cry
It's not that I'm lonely or that I'm blue
It's just that I need to be with you
[Bridge]
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
[Verse-2]
When I know our love is going strong
And I have all I need to carry on
And my mind and body seem to understand
That for me you are the perfect man
[Interlude]
Our love, our love
[Chorus]
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
[Repeat 3x]
