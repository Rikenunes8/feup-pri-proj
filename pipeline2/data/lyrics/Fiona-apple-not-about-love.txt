[Verse 1]
The early cars already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases, sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor
[Hook 1]
And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range
For the gag and the bind and the ammunition round
[Verse 2]
Conversation, once colored by esteem
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda while you're spitting your cud
[Hook 2]
And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range
For the gag and the bind and the ammunition round
[Chorus]
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache
[Verse 3]
"What is this posture I have to stare at"
That's what he said when I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game 'cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong, but he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair 'cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things that I said that he stole
Put 'em in a sack, swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light[Chorus]
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache
