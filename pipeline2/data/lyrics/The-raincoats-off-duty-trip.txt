Just a couple in the park
Pounding out those games in the dark
Those who walk past her screams
Are only reminded of love’s young dreams
A scuffle, violating arms
Can only prove the strength of his charms
Woman, you’re pinned up
On the wall in front of you
A soldier’s life is very tough
Needs tender loving when fighting’s through
Join the professionals
(The professionals)
Yes they’re really strangers in the night
Oh they’re saying to me if you put up a fight
It’s not just a kiss you owe me
It’s all this ammunition loaded
I bought you a drink
And well, we’re walking hand in hand
Woman, you’re pinned up
On the wall in front of you
A soldier’s life is very tough

Seaside town, off-duty trip
Taking flesh, going to let it rip
With rings on his finger
Sharp like the taste that still lingers
Flavor of this month — center spread
57 Page Three varieties in his head
Woman, you’re pinned up
On the wall in front of you
A soldier’s life is very tough
Needs tender loving when fighting’s through
Join the professionals
Save one of the professionals
