[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Doomed
Pick your pocket, full of sorrow
And run away with me tomorrow
June
[Bridge 1]
We'll try and ease the pain
But somehow, we'll feel the same
Well, no one knows
Where our secrets go
[Verse 2]
I send a heart to all my dearies
When your life is so, so dreary
Dream
I'm rumored to the straight and narrow
While the harlots of my perils
Scream
[Chorus 1]
And I fail
But when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Mother, weep the years I'm missing
All our time can't be given
Back
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
That cursed you and your reasons
Out of hand and out of season
Out of love and out of feeling
[Chorus 2]
So bad
When I can, I will
Words defy the plans
When I can, I will[Bridge 2]
Fool enough to almost be it
And cool enough to not quite see it
Dull enough to always feel this
Always old, I'll always feel this
No more promise, no more sorrow
No longer will I follow
Can anybody hear me?
I just want to be me
[Chorus 3]
And when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will
