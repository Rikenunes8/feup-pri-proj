[Verse 1]
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
[Chorus]
He said "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love
[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
[Chorus]
And you say "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ahh
[Outro]
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do
