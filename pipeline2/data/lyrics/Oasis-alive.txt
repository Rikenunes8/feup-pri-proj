[Verse 1]
The people will notice that the times are changing
It's just time for now but not time for good
It's my feelings that I think you're draining
Take them now if you think you should
[Chorus]
You want something for nothing
The higher that you climb the longer you fall
Maybe your time is coming
Will you ask to climb when you find the wall
Is it time to doubt? Is it time to wait?
Will you be left alone at the starting gate
I'm not blind and I do mind
Because I've got time now I'm alive
[Verse 2]
The people have noticed that the times are changing
But are they going to be something now
I think I've seen you all hesitating
I think I'll go and be something now
[Chorus]
You want something for nothing
The higher that you climb the longer you fall
Maybe your time is coming
Will you ask to climb when you find the wall
Is it time to doubt? Is it time to wait?
Will you be left alone at the starting gate
I'm not blind and I do mind
Because I've got time now I'm alive
[Outro]
Yeah, I'm alive
Yeah, I'm alive
Yeah, I'm alive
