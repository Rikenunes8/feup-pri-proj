I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
Monday through Saturday I get by just fine
Every other day of the week I feel alright
But I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
Sunday's supposed to be the day for kicking off your shoes
But how come that's the day I always get the blues
And I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
Ever since you had to go I just carry on
But deep down inside I know there's something wrong
And I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
I can't seem to make it through Sunday
