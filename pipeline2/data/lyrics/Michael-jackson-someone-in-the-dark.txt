[Verse 1]
All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend
[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you
[Verse 2]
Promise me we will always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me
[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Oh I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
[Verse 3]
Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
