[Verse 1]
Do I want you for my baby?
Do I want you by my side?
Do I wanna run and kiss your lips
And say you're my loving guy?
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Do I love you?)
Oh, oh, oh (Yes, I love you)
[Verse 2]
Do I need your arms around me?
Do I live my life for you?
Do I always feel so warm each time
I look in your eyes of blue?
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Do I love you?)
Oh, oh, oh (Yes, I love you)
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
And do I need you every minute of the day?
And would I die if you should ever go away?
And does it mean so much to feel your tender touch?
Do I love you? (Do I love you?)
Really love you? (Really love you?)
[Verse 3]
Oh, I swear I'm gonna get you
If takes me all my life
I'll hope and pray and dream and scheme
'Cause I'm gonna be your wife[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Do I love you?)
Oh, oh, oh (Yes, I love you)
[Outro]
Do I love you?
Yes, I love you
Do I love you?
Yes, I love you
Do I love you?
Yes, I love you
Do I love you?
Yes, I love you
