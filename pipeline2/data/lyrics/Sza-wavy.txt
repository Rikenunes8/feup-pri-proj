[Verse 1: SZA]
I think I'm bad as hell
I got issues, out of line
Sayin' tomorrow I'll get the dishes
Never come
Easy bake, easy wake, oven
Just give as much as you take
Forgive as much as you hate
Or get the fuck out
[Pre-Chorus 1: SZA]
I've been in the dugout
Lookin' for a way out
You know just takin' it slow
Now I'm feeling worn out
Lookin' for a way out
Somebody show me the door
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I was wavy
And I was drownin'
I went crazy
And I found out, this the way out
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy
[Verse 2: SZA]
I need, I need, I need another re-up
I need, I need, I need another peace of mind
Need more than California
Couple of waves, think I need the whole sea
Couple of days, think I need the whole week
Nigga, I can just beat the univеrse
'Cause I, I, I, I, I, I provide for mysеlf
Ride for myself, die for day ones
Get down 'cause they got guns
And no one around to save you, come correct
It's gory
Good morning New Jersey
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the door babe
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the ropes, babe[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I was wavy
And I was drownin'
I went crazy
And I found out, this the way out
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy
