[Intro]
Hey, oh
Yeah
[Chorus]
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said, "I love you"
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine, tell me
[Verse]
How could you be so cold to me?
When I gave you everything
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please?
If you love me, how could you do that to me, tell me
Whoa, hey
[Bridge]
Yeah, how could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever
Can't understand
No I can't understand
[Chorus]
How could the one I gave my heart to (Oh)
Break my heart so bad? (Break my heart)
How could the one who made me happy (You made me so happy)
Make me feel so sad? (Oh, yeah)
Won't somebody tell me? (Won't they tell me?)
So I can understand (So I can understand)
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that? (How could you hurt me?)
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away? (Throw my world away)
How could the one who said, "I love you" (You said you love me)
Say the things you say? (But you didn't love me, oh)
How could the one I was so true to (Yeah, you did)
Just tell me lies? (You told me lies, oh yeah)[Outro]
How could the one I gave my heart to (Ooh)
Make me feel so sad? (Hey)
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
Ooh, tell me
