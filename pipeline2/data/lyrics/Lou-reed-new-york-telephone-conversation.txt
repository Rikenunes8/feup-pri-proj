[Verse 1]
I was sleeping, gently napping when I heard the phone
Who is on the other end talking, am I even home?
Did you see what she did to him, did you hear what they said?
Just a New York conversation rattling in my head
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, my, and what shall we wear?
Oh, oh, my, and who really cares?
[Verse 2]
Just a New York conversation, gossip all of the time
Did you hear who did what to whom? Happens all the time
Who has touched and who has dabbled here in the city of shows?
Openings, closings, bad repartee, 
everybody knows
[Bridge]
Oh, how sad and why do we call?
Oh, I'm glad to hear from you all
[Verse 3]
I am calling, yes I am calling, just to speak to you
For I know this night will kill me if I can't be with you
If I can't be with you
