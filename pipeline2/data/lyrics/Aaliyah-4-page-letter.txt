[Intro]
Yo, turn my music up
Up some more, up some more
Up a little bit more
[Verse 1]
Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy
I was too shy, so I decided to write
[Chorus]
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
[Verse 2]
People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
Maybe when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't diss me
[Chorus]
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time[Bridge]
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch
'Cause the mailman's coming
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch
'Cause the mailman's coming
[Chorus]
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
