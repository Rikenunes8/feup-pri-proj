[Verse 1]
What have you done to the mirror?
What have you done to the floor?
Can't I go nowhere without you?
Can't I leave you alone anymore?
Can't I leave you alone anymore?
[Verse 2]
I know you don't think much of me
But someday you'll understand
Wait'll you learn how to talk, baby
I'll show you how smart I am
I'll show you how smart I am
[Chorus]
A quitter never wins
A winner never quits
When the going gets tough
The tough get going
[Verse 3]
Maybe you don't know how to walk, baby
Maybe you can't talk none either
Maybe you never will, baby
But I'll always love you
I'll always love you
