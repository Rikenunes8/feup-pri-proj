[Verse 1]
In Candy's room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall
But to get to Candy's room you gotta walk the 
darkness
 of Candy's hall
Strangers from the city call my baby's number and they bring her toys
When I come knocking she smiles pretty she knows I wanna be Candy's boy
There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face
A sadness all her own from which no man can keep Candy safe
[Verse 2]
We kiss, my heart rushes through my brain
And the blood rushes in my veins
The fire rushes towards the sky
And we go driving, driving deep into the night
I go driving deep into the light in Candy's eyes
She says baby if you wanna be wild
You got a lot to learn, close your eyes
Let them melt, let them fire, let them burn
'Cause in the 
darkness there'll be hidden worlds that shine
When I hold Candy close she makes those hidden worlds mine
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
She has fancy clothes and diamond rings
She has men who give her anything she wants
But they don't see
That what she wants is me
[Outro]
Oh and I want her so
I'll never let her go, no no no
She knows that I'd give
All that I've got to give
All that I want, all that I live
To make Candy mine
Tonight
