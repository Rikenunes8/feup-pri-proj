Don't talk crazy now
Take it easy
You just can't hold out forever
Don't you lie to me
You said you love me
Don't say you don't remember
'Cause you told me
Yeah, you did
And I'm not gonna let you forget
Well, I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging again
You tell me why that you have to pretend
I know you want me, why don't you give in?
Surrender
Don't let me down
I can't just hang around
Feeling this way forever
On your balcony
You said you love me
Don't say you don't remember
'Cause you told me
Yeah, you did
And I'm not gonna let you forget
Well, I'm down on my knees
And I'm bеgging again
You tell me why that you have to prеtend
I don't like it when you looking at him
Surrender
Surrender to me
Baby, surrender, surrender
Surrender
Surrender
To me
Baby, surrender, surrender
Surrender
Surrender
To me
Baby, surrender, surrender
