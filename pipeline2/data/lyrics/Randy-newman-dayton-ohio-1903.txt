[Verse 1]
Sing a song of long ago
When things were green and movin' slow
And people'd stop to say hello
Or they'd say "hi" to you
[Chorus]
Would you like to come over for tea
With the missus and me?
It's a real nice way
To spend the day
In Dayton, Ohio
On a lazy Sunday afternoon in 1903
[Verse 2]
Sing a song of long ago
When things could grow
And days flowed quietly
The air was clean and you could see
And folks were nice to you
[Chorus]
Would you like to come over for tea
With the missus and me?
It's a real nice way
To spend the day
In Dayton, Ohio
On a lazy Sunday afternoon in 1903
