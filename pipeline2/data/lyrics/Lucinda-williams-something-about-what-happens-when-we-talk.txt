[Verse 1]
If I had my way
I'd be in your town
I might not stay
But at least I would have been around
[Chorus]
Cause there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
[Verse 2]
Does this make sense?
It doesn't matter anyway
Is it coincidence?
Or was it meant to be
[Chorus]
Cause there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
[Verse 3]
And conversation with you
Was like a drug
It wasn't your face
So much as it was your words
[Chorus]
And there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
[Verse 4]
I can't stay around
Cause I'm going back south
But all I regret now
Is I never kissed your mouth
[Chorus]
Cause there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
