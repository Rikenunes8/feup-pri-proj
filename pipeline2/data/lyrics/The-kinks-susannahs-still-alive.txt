Oh, Susannah's bedraggled but she
Still wears the locket 'round her neck
She's got a picture on the table
Of a man who is young and able
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Whiskey or a gin, that's alright
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down
Hoping that somebody gets in
Doesn't matter what she does
She knows that she can't win
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
She's got a doll with one eye
That always cries when it gets some sleep
She's waiting for a soldier to come home
But she'll cry and never die
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Whiskey or a gin, that's alright
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down
Hoping that somebody gets in
Doesn't matter what she does
She knows that she can't win
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Oh, Susannah's still alive
