It is my theory
The two of us are somewhat leery
About the happiness
We both set out to possess
We've got all the comforts of life
A few kids and you are my wife
And I tell it like it is
I must confess
I'm gonna have to give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up
Oh, concern and the trust
That never happened with us
The warmth of embraces
And the love of our faces
It never happened, you see
And I'm so sorry
I really truly love you
And the kids, you must agree
And I never had too much concern
Or interest in astrology
But as I read, it must be so
The invulnerable word "incompatible"
No matter how much we try
Our indifference would still show
Now we've got to give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up
Oh, concern and the trust
That never happened with us
The warmth of embraces
And the love of our faces
It never happened, you see
And I'm so sorryNow we've got to give it up (Oh, child)
I've got to give it up (Lord, have mercy)
Now I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
Oh, concern and the trust
That never happened with us
The walk of embraces
And the love of our faces
It never happened, you see
And I'm so sorry
But now we've got to give it up (What am I to do?)
Child, we've got to give it up (I'll be so lonely without you)
But now I've got to give it up (Lord, forgive me)
I've got to give it up
Now I've got to give it up
Gonna have to give it up
Now I've got to give it up
