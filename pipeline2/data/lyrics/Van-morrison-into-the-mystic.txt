[Verse 1]
We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won
As we sailed into the mystic
[Verse 2]
Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
Into the mystic
[Pre-Chorus]
And when that foghorn blows
I will be coming home, mmhmm hmm
And when the foghorn blows
I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it
[Chorus]
And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will float
Into the mystic, mmm
[Instrumental Verse]
[Pre-Chorus]
When that foghorn blows
You know I will be coming home, mmm uh
And when that foghorn whistle blows
I gotta hear it
I don't have to fear it
[Chorus]
And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will float
Into the mystic
, mmm
Come on girl[Instrumental Verse]
[Outro]
Too late to stop now
