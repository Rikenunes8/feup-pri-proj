[Verse 1]
Everyone has choice
When to or not to raise their voices
It's you that decides
Which way you will turn
While feeling that our love's not your concern
It's you that decides
[Bridge]
No one around you
Will carry the blame for you
No one around you
Will love you today and throw it all away
[Verse 2]
Tomorrow when you rise
Another day for you to realise me
Or send me down again
As the days stand up on end
You've got me wondering how I lost your friendship
But I see it in your eyes
[Bridge]
Though I'm beside you
I can't 
carry the blame
 for you
I may decide to
Get out with your blessing
Where I'll carry on guessing[Verse 3]
How high will you leap
Will you make enough for you to reap it?
Only you'll arrive
At your own made end
With no one but yourself to be offended
It's you that decides
