[Chorus]
The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face
[Verse 1]
I just made love with your sweet memory
One thousand times in my head
You said you loved it more than ever
You said
[Pre-Chorus]
You remain, turned away
Turning further every day
[Chorus]
The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face
[Verse 2]
I talked for hours to your wallet photograph
And you just listened
You laughed, enchanted by my intellect
Or maybe you didn't
[Pre-Chorus]
You remain, turned away
Turning further every day
[Chorus]
The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
You remain, turned away
Turning further every day
[Chorus]
The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face
[Outro]
(Do you believe what I sing now?)
The world has turned and left me here
(Do you believe what I sing now?)
Just where I was before you appeared
(Do you believe?)
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my
Do you believe what I sing now?
Do you believe what I sing now?
Do you believe?
