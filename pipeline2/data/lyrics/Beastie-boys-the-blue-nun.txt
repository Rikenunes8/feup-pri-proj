Our evening began
In Peter Sichel's comfortable study
In his New York townhouse
Where the candlelight was just right
The hi-fi was in the background
And the wine, was delicious
[Woman] What's the secret, Peter?
[Peter] Naturally, I'll say it's the wine
[Woman] Mmmm, it does go well with the chicken!
Delicious again, Peter
