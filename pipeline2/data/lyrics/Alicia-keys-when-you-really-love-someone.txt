[Verse 1]
I'm a woman
Lord knows it's hard
I need a real man
To give me what I need, uh
Sweet attention
Love and tenderness
When it's real, it's unconditional
I'm tellin' y'all
[Chorus]
'Cause a man just ain't a man if he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feelin' low
He's givin you his last
'Cause he's thinkin' of you first
Givin' comfort when he's thinkin' that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all
[Verse 2]
'Cause you're a real man
And Lord knows it's hard
Sometimes you just need a woman's touch
Sweet affection
Love and support
When it's real, it's unconditional
I'm tellin' y'all
[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause a woman ain't a woman if she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher, oh
When the world got you feelin' low
She's givin' you her best
Even when you're at your worst
Givin' comfort when she's thinkin' that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all
[Bridge]
Sometimes you wanna argue, sometimes you wanna fight
Sometimes it's gonna feel like it'll never be right
But something so strong keeps you holding on
It don't make sense, but it make a good song[Chorus]
'Cause a man just ain't a man if he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong (Love you when you're strong)
Take you higher
When the world got you feelin' low
He's givin' you his last
'Cause he's thinkin' of you first
Givin' comfort when he's thinkin' that you're hurt
Oh, that's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all
[Chorus]
I'm tellin' y'all that a woman ain't a woman
If she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher (And higher)
When the world got you feelin' low
She's givin' you her best
Even when you're at your worst
Givin' comfort when she's thinkin' that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all[Outro]
Hmm, hmm, yeah
Hmm, hmm, yeah
Hmm, hmm, yeah
Hmm, hmm, yeah
Hmm,  hmm, yeah
