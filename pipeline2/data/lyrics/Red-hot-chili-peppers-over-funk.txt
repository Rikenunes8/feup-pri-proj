[Verse 1]
Please start dirty
It’s 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest
Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon I’ll call the rhythm song
[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look
[Post-Chorus 1]
Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call
[Verse 2]
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look
[Post-Chorus 2]
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
There’s an only count
This stands for all of them
[Bridge]
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong
[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look
