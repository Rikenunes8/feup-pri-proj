[Verse 1]
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
[Bridge]
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 3]
You smiled, you smiled
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last
