[Verse 1]
Late at night gazing out into the late at night
I see deep in the world 'til I open my eyes
Every day brakes screech outside my window
Those crashing cars never seem to collide
[Bridge]
Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
[Chorus]
I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
It blows my mind
[Verse 2]
Every day I'm drawn to my window
I can hear it if I open my eyes
Sometimes flashing lights seem so familiar
I know I've seen them circling me at night
[Chorus]
I've been sending signals into outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
It blows my mind
[Verse 3]
Every day the restlessness takes over me
I can see it as I'm closing my eyes
[Chorus]
I've been sending signals into outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
[Outro]
Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
I've been getting messages from outer space
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
They spiral like a finger in the sky
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky
