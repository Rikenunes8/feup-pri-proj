[Verse 1]
Oh, cheeky, cheeky
Oh, naughty, sneaky
You're so perceptive and I wonder how you knew
[Chorus]
But these finks don't walk too well
A bad sense of direction
And so they stumble round in threes
Such a strange collection
[Verse 2]
Oh, you headless chicken
Can those poor teeth take so much kicking?
You're always so charming
As you peck your way up there
[Chorus]
And these finks don't dress too well (Oh no, oh no)
No discrimination (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
To be a zombie all the time (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
Requires such dedication (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
[Guitar Solo]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)[Bridge]
Oh please sir, will you let it go by
'Cause I failed both tests with my legs both tied
In my place the stuff is all there
I've been ever so sad for a very long time
My, my, they wanted the works, can you this and that
I never got a letter back
More fool me, bless my soul
More fool me, bless my soul
More fool me, bless my soul
More fool me, bless my soul
More fool me, bless my soul
[Verse 3]
Oh, perfect masters
They thrive on disasters
They all look so harmless
Till they find their way up here
[Chorus]
But dead finks don't talk too well 
(Dead finks don't talk)
 (Oh no, oh no)
They've got a shaky sense of diction 
(Dead finks don't talk)
 (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
It's not so much a living hell 
(Dead finks don't talk)
 (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
It's just a dying fiction 
(Dead finks don't talk)
 (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
