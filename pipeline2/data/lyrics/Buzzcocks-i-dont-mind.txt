[Verse 1]
Reality's a dream (O-o-o-ooh)
A game in which I seem to never find out just what I am
I don't know if I'm an actor or ham, a shaman or sham
[Hook]
But if you don't mind, I don't mind
[Verse 2]
I'm lost without a clue (O-o-o-ooh)
So how can I undo the tangle of these webs I keep weaving?
I don't know if I should be believing, deceptive perceiving
[Hook]
But if you don't mind, I don't mind
[Chorus]
I used to bet that you didn't care (O-o-oh)
But gambling never got me anywhere (O-o-oh)
Each time, I used to feel so sure (O-oh)
Something about you made me doubt you more (O-oh)
[Verse 3]
How can you convince me? (O-o-o-ooh)
When everything I see just makes me feel you're putting me down?
And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around (A-a-ah)
[Hook]
That's if you don't mind, I don't mind
[Chorus]
I used to bet that you didn't care (O-o-oh)
But gambling never got me anywhere (O-o-oh)
Each time, I used to feel so sure (O-oh)
Something about you made me doubt you more (O-oh)
[Bridge]
I even think you hate me when you call me on the phone
And sometimes when we go out, then, I wish I'd stayed at home
And when I'm dreaming, or just lying in my bed
I think you've got it in for me, is it all in my head?
Is it in my head?[Verse 4]
How can you convince me? (O-o-o-ooh)
When everything I see just makes me feel you're putting me down?
And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around (A-a-ah)
[Hook]
That's if you don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
