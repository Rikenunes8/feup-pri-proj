It's allright, it' allright, honey it's allright
Long as I know
Long as I know that you love me
Honey, it's allright
Oh my friends tell me that you found somebody new
They report to me
Every little thing that you do
But as long as you tell me that it's all untrue
Baby, it's allright
One more thing I want you to know
If you ever worry
If you're all alone
Remember darling that
I'm as near as your telephone
And if you need me honey
All you have to do is call me
Honey, believe me, it's allright
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heartI think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
