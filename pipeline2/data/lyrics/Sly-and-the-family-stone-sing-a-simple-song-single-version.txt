Sing a simple song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talking, talking, talking, talking, talking in my sleep
I'm walking, walking, walking, walking, walking in the street
Time is passing, I grow older, things are happening fast
All I have to hold on to is a simple song at last
Let me hear you say
"Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya"
Sing a simple song
Try a little do re mi fa so la ti do
Do re mi fa so la ti do
Do re mi fa so la ti do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm living, living, living life with all its ups and downs
I'm giving, giving, giving love and smiling at the frowns
You're in trouble when you find it's hard for you to smile
A simple song might make it better for a little while
Let me hear you say
"Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talking, talking, talking, talking
I'm walking, walking, walking, walking
I'm living, living, living, living
I`m giving love and lovin' loving
Everybody sing together
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, yaSing it in the shower
Sing it every hour
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
Sing it with your mother sing it
Sing it, mama, sing it
Sing it with your father sing it
Sing it, papa, sing it, sing it
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
I'm talking now, I'm walking
I'm walking, oh yeah
Okay, okay now
