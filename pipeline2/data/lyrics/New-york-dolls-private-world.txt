(Break-down)
Private world
Private world
Well, I just lost a lover, who done found somebody else
I get cool and lonely, feelin' sorry for myself
Private world
Private world
Oh, you call that drivin', then see us dream
How could it last? I'm tryin' hard not to scream
Private world
Private world
The joint start shakin', it's ready to crumble
The boys are dukin', lookin' for a rumble
Private world
Private world
One that is movin', at least I'm movin'
(Better shut that door)

Private girl
Private world
(Better keep it confidential)
Private eorld
Private world
Oh, you know I want some money, she replies
When uptown comes downtown, better take her for a ride
Private world
Private worldHow many called, called my name
I'm tryin' to explain that I'm not the same
In a private world
In a private world
Well, I just lost a lover, who done found somebody else
I get cool and lonely, feelin' sorry for myself
In a private world
In a private world
One that is movin', at least I'm movin'
(Shut that door)
Private world
Private girl
Private world
(Better keep it confidential)
You got to keep it confidential
You got to keep it confidential
When I says: Hush
Child, don't you cry
I'm beggin' you: Hush
And dry those tears from your eyes
You gotta hush
Dontcha know, you gotta hush(Oh, alright)
