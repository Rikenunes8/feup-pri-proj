[Verse 1]
Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me
[Chorus]
And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me
[Verse 2]
Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?
[Chorus]
I can hear all the cries of the city
No time for pity
For a growing tree
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me
[Chorus]
And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me
