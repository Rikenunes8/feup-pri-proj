[Spoken Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
How could it be that you knew me?
My deepest fears, my fantasies
Confide in you what no one knows
But it feels so real (One, two, three, four)
[Pre-Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty
[Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Whoa, I feel empty
(When I close my eyes)
[Verse 2]
Is this a new way to love?
Never face to face, is it enough?
Does it really count or am I a fool?
So tell me, please, am I wasting my time?
Your phrases, descriptive
And through the textured words
With beauty, you post it
And use such colored verbs
We've never met, ooh (One, two, three, four)

(When I close my eyes) Whoa, I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Ohm yeah yeah

Sometimes you're there, sometimes you're gone

Wait for hours for your return
So tell me please, am I wasting my time?
Your phrases, descriptive
