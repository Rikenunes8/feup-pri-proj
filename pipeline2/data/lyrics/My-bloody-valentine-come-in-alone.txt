[Verse 1]
Come in alone
You'll love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Oh)
Run and hide
[Verse 2]
Why I don't need to believe
What you see
To look up and around
You were gone
Words came out to a sound
[Verse 3]
Feel I'm alive
You will see
Why and why
Felt like crying
Over her
I will go
To the wall
(Oh)
Run from some
[Verse 1]
Come in alone
You'll love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Oh)
Run and hide
