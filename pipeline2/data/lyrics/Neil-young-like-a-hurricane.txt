[Verse 1]
Once I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar
Dancing on the light from star to star
Far across the moonbeam
, I know that's who you are
I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire
[Chorus]
You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays
I want to love you but I'm getting blown away
[Verse 2]
I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream
You could have been anyone to me
Before that moment you touched my lips
That perfect feeling when time just slips
Away between us and our foggy trip
[Chorus]
You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays
I want to love you but I'm getting blown away
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 3]
You are just a dreamer and I am just a dream
You could have been anyone to me
Before that moment you touched my lips
That perfect feeling when time just slips
Away between us on our foggy trip
[Chorus]
You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays
I want to love you but I'm getting blown away
