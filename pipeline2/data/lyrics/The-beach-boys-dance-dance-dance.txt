[Verse 1: Mike Love]
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Group
, 
Mike Love
]
I got to dance 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot 
(Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance)
 Dance, 
(dance)
 dance
(Dance)
 Dance, yeah!
[Verse 2: Mike Love]
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Group
, 
Mike Love
]
I got to dance 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot 
(Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance)
 Dance, 
(dance)
 dance
(Dance)
 Dance, yeah!
Oh my!
[Verse 3: Mike Love]
At a weekend dance we like to show up last
I play it cool when it's slow and jump it up when it's fast
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Group
, 
Mike Love
]
I got to dance 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot 
(Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance)
 Dance, 
(dance)
 dance
(Dance)
 Dance, yeah!
[Outro: Brian Wilson,

Ahhh 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Ahhhh 
(Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
Ahhhhhh, oooh 
(Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
(Dance)
 Dance, 
(dance)
 dance
(Dance)
 Dance, yeah!
