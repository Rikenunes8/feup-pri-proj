[Verse 1]
So I sat in the attic, a piano up my nose
And the wind played a dreadful cantata (cantata, cantata)
Sore was I from the crack of an enemy's hose
And the horrible sound of tomato (tomato, tomato)
[Bridge]
Ketchup (ketchup)
Soup and puree (soup and puree)
Don't get left behind (get left behind)
Ketchup (ketchup)
Soup and puree (soup and puree)
Don't get left behind
(Get left behind, get left behind, get left behind)
[Verse 2]
When a rattle of rats had awoken
The sinews, the nerves, and the veins
My piano is boldly outspoken
And attempts to repeat his refrain
So I stood with a knot in my stomach
And I gazed at that terrible sight
Of two youngsters concealed in a barrel
Sucking monkberry moon delight
[Chorus]
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
[Verse 3]
Well, I know my banana is older than the rest
And my hair is a tangled beretta (beretta, beretta)
And when I leave my pyjamas to Billy Budapest
And I don't get the gist of your letter (your letter, your letter)
[Bridge]
Catch up! (catch up)
Cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
Don't get left behind (get left behind)
Catch up! (catch up)
Cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
Don't get left behind (get left behind
Get left behind
Get left behind)[Chorus]
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
[Outro]
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Sucking monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Try some of this honey
What is it?
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
