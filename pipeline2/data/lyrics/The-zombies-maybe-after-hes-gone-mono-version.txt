She told me she loved me with words as soft as morning rain
But the light that fell upon me turned to shadow when he came
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, want me again
I remember joy and pain, her smile, her tears are part of me
I feel I'll never breathe again, I feel life's gone from me
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, want me again
All the days and all the nights are time just passing by
And all the dreams I'm dreaming now hide the tears that I cry
I feel so cold, I'm on my own as the night folds in around me
Night surrounds me, I'm alone
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, want me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, want me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, love me again
Maybe after he's gone she'll come back, want me again
After he's gone she'll come back, want me again
