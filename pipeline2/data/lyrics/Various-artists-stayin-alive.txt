[Verse 1]
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man and no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right and it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
[Verse 2]
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
The legal man down on my shoes
I'm a dancing man and I just can't lose
[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright and it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive[Bridge]
Life going nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me
Life going nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
[Verse 1]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right and it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive[Outro]
Life going nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
