[Verse 1]
How can I? How can I?
How can I make my body shed for you?
How can I? How can I?
How can I make my body shed around your metal scars?
Loretta's scars, Loretta's scars, Loretta's scars
[Chorus]
From now on, I can see the sun
Makes me anxious, makes me run
From now on, I can see the sun
Makes me anxious, makes me run
[Verse 2]
How can I?
How can I make my body shed for you?
How can I? How can I?
How can I make my body shed around your metal scars?
Loretta's scars, Loretta's scars, Loretta's scars
[Chorus]
From now on I can see the sun
Makes me anxious, makes me run
From now on I can see the sun
Makes me anxious, makes me run
[Outro]
From now on I can see the sun
From now on I can see the sun
I can see the sun, I can see the sun
I can see the, see the, see the sun
