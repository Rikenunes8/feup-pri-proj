[Verse 1]
Well, you've got me working so hard lately
Working my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
I'd still be half of what you need
Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask you know I'll do
But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you
[Chorus 1]
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
[Verse 2]
Well, you just leave me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on this cross
I'm just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause
[Chorus 1]
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
[Verse 3]
Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you
[Chorus 1]
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Is deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me[Chorus 2]
Ringfinger
A promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Devil's flesh and bone
Do something for me
[In the lyric booklet but not sung]
I'm so tired I can't get to sleep
And the squeaking of the bed is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head
I just want you to know
"When I do it, I only think of you"
