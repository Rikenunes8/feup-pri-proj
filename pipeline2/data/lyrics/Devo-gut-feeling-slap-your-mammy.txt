[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Something about the way you taste
Makes me want to clear my throat
There's a message to your movements
That really gets my goat
I looked for silver linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
[Chorus]
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
[Verse 2]
Centered 'round long time ago
On your ability to torment
Then you took your tongs of love
And stripped away my garment
I looked for silver linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
[Chorus]
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling[Bridge]
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
(Oh, move it up and down now)
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
(Oh, move it all around now)
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
(Oh, move it up and down now)
Slap your mammy down
Slap your pappy down again
(Oh, move it all around now)
