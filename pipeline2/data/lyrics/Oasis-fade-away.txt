[Verse 1]
When I was young I thought I had my own key
I knew exactly what I wanted to be
Now I'm sure
You've boarded up every door
Lived in a bubble days were never ending
Was not concerned about what life was sending
Fantasy was real
Now I know much about the way I feel
[Refrain]
I'll paint you the picture
'Cause I don't think you live 'round here no more
I've never even seen the key to the door
We only get what we will settle for
[Chorus 1]
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away, away, away
They fade away, away, away
[Verse 2]
Now my life has turned another corner
I think it's only best that I should warn you
Dream it while you can
Maybe someday I'll make you understand
[Refrain]
I'll paint you the picture
'Cause I don't think you live 'round here no more
I've never even seen the key to the door
We only get what we will settle for
[Chorus 2]
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away
While we're living
The dreams we have as children fade away, away, away
They fade away, away, away
They fade away, away, away
Fade away, away, away[Outro]
