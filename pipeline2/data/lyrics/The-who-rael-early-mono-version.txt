[Verse 1]
The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael
The country of my fathers
A proud land of old order
Like a goldfish being swallowed by a whale
[Chorus]
Rael, the home of my religion
To me, the center of the Earth
[Verse 2]
The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael
My heritage is threatened
My roots are torn and cornered
And so to do my bеst, I'll homeward sail
And so to do my best, I'll homeward sail
[Alt. Chorus]
Now captain, listеn to my instructions
Return to this spot on Christmas Day
Look towards the shore for my signal
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay
[Verse 3]
If a yellow flag is fluttering
Sickly herald against the morn
Then you'll my courage has ended
And you'll send your boat ashore
But if a red flag is flying
Brazen bold against the blue
Then you'll know that I am staying
And my yacht belongs to you
[Alt. Chorus]
Now captain, listen to my instructions
Return to this spot on Christmas Day
Look towards the shore for my signal
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay[Verse 4]
He's crazy if he thinks
We're coming back again
He's crazy if he thinks
We're coming back again
He's crazy if he thinks
We're coming back again
He's crazy, anyway
[Outro]
If a yellow flag is fluttering
Sickly herald against the morn
Then you'll my courage has ended
And you'll send your boat ashore
