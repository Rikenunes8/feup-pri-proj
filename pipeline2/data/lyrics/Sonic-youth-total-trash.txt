[Verse 1]
It started the top
Now it's spiraling down
Works best when it's lost
Digging underground
[Chorus 1]
Never mind it now
We can bring it back
It's total trash
And it's a natural fact that I'm not no cow
[Verse 2]
It's never the same
It's more than a game
Can't take it away
Can't kill all the shame
[Chorus 2]
It's a guilty man
That increased the crack
It's total trash
Slap 'em on the back with a heavy rock
[Chorus 3]
There it goes again
Magic monkey friend
God, I love the time
That he seems to spend with all the kids in town
[Verse 3]
It started the top
Now it's spiraling down
Works best when it's lost
Digging underground
[Chorus 1]
Never mind it now
We can bring it back
It's total trash
And it's a natural fact that I'm not no cow
