[Verse 1]
Well maybe in the mornin', I don't know
Baby don't know, just how soon
But I'm leavin' you
Woman I've got to put you down
Well if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use of me hangin' around
[Verse 2]
Well you told me that you love me, you cross your heart to die
But I found out that wasn't so
I'm leavin' you
Woman I got to put you down
Girl, if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use for me hangin' around
[Verse 3]
Well, early in the mornin' before I rise
You layin' down rollin' your bloodshot eyes
You a mean little thing
Meanest woman I ever seen
No matter how I try to treat you right
Still you's a mean little thing
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Well, you told me that you love me, you cross your heart to die
But I found out, baby, bye bye
I'm leavin'
Woman I got to put you down
Well if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use for me hangin' around
[Verse 3]
Well, early in the mornin' before I rise
You layin' down rollin' your bloodshot eyes
You's a mean little thing
Mean little thing as you can be
Well if you can't treat me right
Still you's a mean little thing[Outro]
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
