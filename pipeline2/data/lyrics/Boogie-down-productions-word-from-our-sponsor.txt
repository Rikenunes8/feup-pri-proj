[Intro]
This is a test
Of the Boogie Down Production 
prevention against sucka MCs
In the event of a real emergency
You would have been instructed on which jams to play
And how loud to blast your radio
And now, a word from our sponsor
[Verse 1: KRS-One]
I'm from the Bronx
, Blastmaster KRS-One
Proving that my job ain't done until I get some
More, no need to roar or yell
'Cause I can still tell what will sell
And would have sold without yellin' over a drum roll
That style is old
So unfold, blossom, bloom
You got the room, so go ahead and consume
A new era, KRS-One comes better
Bite another lyric? Never
'Cause I'm too clever, however, I own my own label
Partners with Scott LaRock, he's on the turntable
And partner Lee Smith
I'm exercising a true gift just to uplift
Hip-hop, hip-hop, my voice is like a monster
And now a word from our sponsor
[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
I got to start this rhyme again
How many words can I find that rhyme and still keep in mind
Every lyric must come out on time?
Not many, but I have plenty
Scott La Rock sent me just to devastate any-
One, any daughter, any son that comes my way
Hey, you got to go the other way
I represent my DJ Scott LaRock, 
D-Nice the beat box
I only wear Nikes, not Adidas or Reeboks
Many people know me, yet I'm known by few
My name is KRS-One, son, 
not two
Or three or four or five or six
The mix is on Scott LaRock and Scott LaRock is on the mix
[Verse 3: KRS-One]
Cool like the air we breathe
Inhale, exhale, perpetrators will fail
As sure as my name is Blastmaster KRS
Sit and listen to the very essence of this tale
From the days of prison I have uprisen
To my family members I'm marked down as missing
Listen, 
circumstances put me right in the street
With the will to survive, get paid, eat and sleep
Some weep, or should I rather say, some cry
Can't get by, so later on they die
Because the strong will survive, the weak will perish
Ignorance is a poison and knowledge will nourish
I love what I got and like what I had
I'm glad, not sad and I don't even get mad
I get even, myself and some others I believe in
'Cause these others are my brothas and perfection we're achieving
Yes, my name is KRS, my brother is a Rasta
Let me pause and now a word from our sponsor
