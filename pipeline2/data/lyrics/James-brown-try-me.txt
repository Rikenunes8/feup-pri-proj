[Intro, spoken]
You know, if there ever was a classic, I guess
With all the tunes I've written myself, you know
I always try to have a meaning behind, uh... every time I write a tune
And when I wrote "Please, Please", I wrote it because I was hungry
Then I started tellin' a whole lot of stories, you know...
About my life, and what's really made it sad, you know
But uh... then after about three years, I ran into somewhat of a vamp
I couldn't get nothin' to go, I couldn't cut a tune
Asked 'em "Please, Please", and that- that didn't make it
Everybody was telling me what to cut, but you have to cut what you feel
So I came up with a... a tune, I said "I did everything
I've tried everything, I can't get nothin' to go", you know
So... I just say "Hey, let me do one from my heart"
And uh... after trying everything, it was only one thing I could do or say...
Hit it, fellas
