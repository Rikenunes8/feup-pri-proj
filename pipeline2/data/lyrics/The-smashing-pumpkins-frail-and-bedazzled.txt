Say, now listen here
I wanna be oh-so clear
I lost myself
And lost I'll stay
Between my friends and my malaise
And here I am, frail
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare
Tug at my sleeve
My little girl, my sweet Marie
She don't know how bad I am
Stole my smile from the Cheshire Cat
And all I wanted was to be happy
And since I've gave up
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
Two of us less dangerous
It's all inside our heads
Givin' in for nothin' less
Leavin' me for you
Try to understand
The ones I love and their demands
It's so unfair when they can't see
That I'm the boy that really needs
Their love has failed
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare
