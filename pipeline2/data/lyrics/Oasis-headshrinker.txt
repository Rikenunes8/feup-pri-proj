[Verse 1]
I know a girl who's lost and lonely
Sits by the phone on her own
But the phone don't ring
And the birds don't sing in her tree
She lost herself in a haze of pity
And doesn't know where to run
She's a headshrinker now
And I think its time we had some fun
[Chorus 1]
Lost in a fog
I've been treated like a dog
And I'm out of here
I got no name
And I feel no shame
And I got no fear
And I bow down
To the tears of a clown
Whatever's going down
Is coming around
I hope you don't regret today
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
[Solo]
[Chorus 2]
Lost in a fog
I've been treated like a dog
And I'm out of here
I got no name
And I feel no shame
And I got no fear
And I bow down
To the tears of a clown
Whatever's going down
Is coming around
I hope you don't regret today
For the rest of your lives
[Solo]
