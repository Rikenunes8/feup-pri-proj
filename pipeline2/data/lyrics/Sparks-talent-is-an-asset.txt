[Verse 1]
Albert is smart, he's a genius
Watch Albert putter, an obvious genius
Someday he will reassess the world
And he'll still have time for lots of girls
[Verse 2]
When he grows up he'll remember us
When he grows up we are sure that he'll remember us
We made sure that Albert wore his mac
We kept all the strangers off his back
[Chorus]
(Go away)
Everything's relative
(Go away Albert's mother does say to me)
We are his relatives and he don't need any non-relatives
Talent is an asset
You've got to understand that
Talent is an asset
And little Albert has it
Talent is an asset
And Albert surely has it
[Verse 3]
One day he'll sever his apron strings
All of the while he'll be scribbling things, genius things
Look at Albert, isn't he a sight
Growing, growing at the speed of light
[Chorus]
(Go away)
Everything's relative
(Go away Albert's mother does say to me)
We are his relatives and he don't need any non-relatives
Talent is an asset
And little Albert has it[Bridge]
(Go away) Talent is relative
(Go away) That's hypothetical
(Go away) We are his relatives
(Go away) 
That's parenthetical
(Go away) 
Spare your superlatives
(Go away) There's the receptacle
(Go away) There's the receptacle
(Go away) Leave Albert's study room
(Go away) Leave Albert's happy home
(Go away) Leave Albert's neighborhood
(Go away) Leave Albert's city, too
(Go away) Leave Albert's country seat
(Go away) 
Leave Albert's country
(Go away) Leave Albert's continent
(Go away) Leave Albert's hemisphere
(Go away) Leave Albert's planet, too
(Go away) Leave Albert's universe
(Go away) No one must see him now
(Go away) Only the medical
(Go away) No one must downgrade him
(Go away) Don't be too cynical
(Go away) Don't be too critical
(Go away) Cancel the magazines
(Go away) They're much too political
(Go away) Don't buy him any jeans
(Go away) They're much too casual
(Go away) Talent is relative
(Go away) That's hypothetical
(Go away) We are his relatives
(Go away) That's parenthetical
