I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I had
To find you I'd suffer anything
And be glad
I'd pay any price just to get you
Work all my life and I will
To win you I'd stand
Naked, stoned and stabbed
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you
I'm gonna run and never stop
I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
With you I'm gonna drown
An unsung man
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
I sit looking 'round
I look at my face in the mirror
I know I'm worth nothing without you
Like one and one don't make two
One and one make one
I'm looking for that free ride to me
I'm looking for you
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you I'm gonna run
And never stop
I'd [Incomprehensible] to find you
Work all my life and I will
To find you I'd stand
Naked, stoned and stabbed
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
