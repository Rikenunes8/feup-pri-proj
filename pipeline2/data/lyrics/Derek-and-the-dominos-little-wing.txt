[Instrumental Intro (0:00 - 0:50)]
[Verse 1]
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running around
Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
[Verse 2]
And when I'm sad, she comes to me
A thousand smiles she gives to me free
Said it's all right, take anything you want from me
(Anything you want, babe) (Anything)
[Instrumental Bridge (1:54 - 3:06)]
[Verse 1]
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running around
Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
[Verse 2]
And when I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
Said it's all right, take anything you want from me, baby
(Anything you want) (Anything)
[Outro]
Whoo
Fly on little wing
Baby, baby
Fly on
