[Chorus]
If not now, then when?
If not today, then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none
[Bridge]
You can wait til morning comes
You can wait for the new day
You can wait and lose this heart
You can wait and soon be sorry
[Chorus]
Cause if not now, then when?
If not today, then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none
[Pre-Chorus]
Now love's the only thing that's free
We must take it where it's found
Pretty soon it may be costly
[Chorus]
Cause if not now, then when?
If not today, then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none[Outro]
If not now, what then
We all must live our lives
Always feeling, always thinking
The moment has arrived
If not now, then when
