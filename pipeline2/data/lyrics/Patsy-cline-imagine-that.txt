Imagine me still lovin' you
After all you've put me through
Well I can't help it, I just do
Imagine that
And that's not the half
Imagine this if you can
I've stood more, more than I should stand
But I'd still take you, back again
Imagine that
Ain't that a laugh
Can you believe, I'd swallow my pride
Well yes, yes, I guess you can
'Cause you know you've always had my foolish heart
Right in the palm of your hand, oh
So for what it's worth it to you
It just don't matter what you might do
'Cause I'm still waitin' and lovin' you
Imagine that
Ain't that a laugh
So for what it's worth, to you
It just don't matter what you might do
'Cause I'll still be waitin' and lovin' you
Imagine that
Ha A... Ain't that a laugh...
