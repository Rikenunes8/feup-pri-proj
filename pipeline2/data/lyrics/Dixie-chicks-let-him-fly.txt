[Verse 1]
Ain't no talkin' to this man
Ain't no pretty other side
Ain't no way to understand
Stupid words of pride
It would take an acrobat
And I already tried all that
I'm gonna let him fly, mmm
[Verse 2]
Things can move at such a pace
The second hand just waved goodbye
You know the light has left his face
You can't recall just where or why
So there was really nothin' to it
I just went and cut right through it
I said, I'm gonna let him fly, ooh yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
There's no mercy in a live wire, no rest at all in freedom
The choices we are given it's... it's no choice at all, oh oh
The proof is in the fire, you touch before it moves away, yeah
But you must always know how long to stay and when to go
[Verse 3]
And there ain't no talkin' to this man
He's been tryin' to tell me so
It took a while to understand
The beauty of just letting go
'Cause it would take an acrobat
And I already tried all that
I'm gonna let him fly
[Outro]
I'm gonna let him fly, fly
Oh oh-oh oh oh
I'm gonna let him fly, oh-oh
I'm... I'm gonna let him fly
