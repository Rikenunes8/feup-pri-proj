[Verse 1]
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
[Verse 2]
It’s a one-track town, just brown, and a breeze, too
Pack up the meat, sweet, we’re heading out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit
Get the loot, don’t be slow, we’re gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, don’t be slow, we’re gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, don’t be slow, we’re gonna catch a trout
[Verse 3]
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle
Bring me my pipe, we’re gonna shake it
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby
[Verse 4]
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
