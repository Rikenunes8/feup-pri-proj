[Verse 1]
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me at night
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone
You've got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard
[Verse 2]
Running to me a-cryin', when he throws you out
Running to me a-cryin', on your own again
You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
But the picture has a mustache
[Chorus]
You're comin' to me
With that soulful look on your face
Coming lookin' like you've
Never ever done one wrong thing
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You're comin' to me
With that soulful look on your face
You're comin' lookin' like you've
Never ever done one wrong thing
[Verse 3]
So many fantastic colors, I feel in a wonderland
Many fantastic colors, makes me feel so good
You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
Got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard
