[Verse 1]
I know that lately
Things haven't been so good
I always said
If I could ever help you I would
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears
[Chorus]
I will be your friend 'til the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile
[Verse 2]
When you're fallin' apart
I pick up each piece
Build a wall around your dreams
The punches to your heart
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal
So trust in me
These are the words I tattoo on you
If Hercules can pick you up
I will I really am true
[Chorus]
I will be your friend 'til the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile
[Bridge]
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears
[Verse 3]
You've got so much to give
I'll tell you (Just when you need to know)
Get out and live
Pick you up when you're feeling low
So here's my hand
Trust in me I really am true
You've got to understand
There's nothing
I wouldn't do[Chorus]
I will be your friend until the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile
[Chorus]
I will be your friend until the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile
[Bridge]
You've got so much to give
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Get out and live
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
I will be your friend until the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile
[Outro]
The Punches to your heart (Ooh, ooh)
Take my hand
When your falling apart (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, you've got to understand
I will be your friend until the end of time
