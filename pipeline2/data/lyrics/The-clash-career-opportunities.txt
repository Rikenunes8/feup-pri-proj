[Verse 1]
They offered me the office, offered me the shop
They said I'd better take anything they'd got
Do you wanna make tea at the BBC?
Do you wanna be, do you really wanna be a cop?
[Chorus]
Career opportunity, the one that never knocks
Every job they offer you's to keep you out the dock
Career opportunity, the one that never knocks
[Verse 2]
I hate the army and I hate the RAF
I don't wanna go fighting in the tropical heat
I hate the civil service rules
I won't open letter bombs for you
[Chorus]
Career opportunity, the one that never knock
Every job they offer you's to keep you out the dock
Career opportunity, the one that never knock
[Bridge]
Oi
Bus driver
Ambulance man
The ticket inspector
I don't understand
[Verse 3]
They're gonna have to introduce conscription
They're gonna have to take away my prescription
If they wanna get me makin' toys
If they wanna get me, well, I got no choice
[Chorus]
Career opportunity, the one that never knock
Every job they offer you's to keep you out the dock
Career opportunity, the one that never knock[Outro]
Career
Career
Career
It ain't never gonna knock
