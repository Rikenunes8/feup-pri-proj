You're tellin' me how bad I am for loving him
That I can't be much and love him, he's your man
Go on, say I'm no good, call me anything you dare
For if how much I love him tells how bad I am
Then you won't find anyone any worse anywhere
I treat him like the man he is
And when he needs me, I'm there
He must not think that I'm so bad, for he takes me everywhere
But if how much I love him tells how bad I am
Then you won't find anyone any worse anywhere
You're tellin' me that you will never set him free
And you say that we've disgraced you, him and me
You know you don't love him and he knows how much I care
So if how much I love him tells how bad I am
Then you won't find anyone any worse anywhere
I treat him like the man he is
And when he needs me, I'm there
He must not think that I'm so bad, for he takes me everywhere
But if how much I love him tells how bad I am
Then you won't find anyone any worse anywhere
