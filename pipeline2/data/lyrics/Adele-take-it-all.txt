[Verse 1]
Didn't I give it all? Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well, having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
[Chorus]
But go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
[Verse 2]
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing gets better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this
[Chorus]
But go on, go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
[Bridge]
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
That everything I do is for you
[Chorus]
But go on, go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
