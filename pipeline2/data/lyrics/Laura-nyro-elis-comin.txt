[Intro]
Eli's comin'
Eli's a-comin' (Eli's a-comin')
Well, you better hide your heart
Your lovin' heart
Eli's a-comin' and the cards say
Broken heart, a broken heart
[Chorus]
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Girl, Eli's a-comin', better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', better hide (You better hide your heart)
Girl, Eli's a-comin', better hide (Your heart)
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin'
[Verse 1]
Better walk walk
But you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burning a-heartache
I walked to Apollo in the bay
Everywhere I go, whoa
[Pre-Chorus]
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get me, Mama
(She walked, but, she walked, but)
I'm down on my knees (She walked, but she never got away)
[Chorus]
Eli's comin' (Hide it)
Girl, Eli's a-comin', better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', better hide (You better hide your heart)
Girl, Eli's a-comin', better hide (Your heart)
Eli's comin', hide your heart
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin'
[Verse 2]
Better walk right
But he's never gonna hear
No, he's never gonna hear, and he ain't gonna follow
Down at the corners of the square
And everywhere I go, whoa[Pre-Chorus]
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get me, Mama
(She walked, but, she walked, but)
I'm down on my knees (She walked, but she never got away)
I'm down on my knees (She walked, better hide your heart, girl)
Oh, no, no, no
[Chorus]
Hide it, whoa, hide it
Hide it, hide it
Hide it, whoa, hide it
Hide it
[Outro]
Eli's comin'
Eli's a-comin' (Eli's a-comin')
Better hide
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
(Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl)
(Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl)
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
(Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl)
(Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl)
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl (Whoa, no)
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', better hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', better hide
