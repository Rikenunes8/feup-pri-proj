[Verse 1]
Trust in me in all you do
Have the faith I have in you
Love will see us through
If only you trust in me
Why don't you, you trust me?
[Verse 2]
Come to me when things go wrong
Cling to me, Daddy, oh yeah and I'll be strong
We can get along
We can get along
Oh if only you trust in me
[Bridge]
While there's a moon, a moon up high
While there are birds, birds to fly
While there is you, you and I
I can be sure that I love you oh
[Verse 3]
Stand beside me
Stand beside me all the while
Come on, Daddy, face the future
Why don't you smile?
Trust in me and I'll be worthy of you
Oh yeah, why don't you trust in me in all you do?
And have the faith I have in you
Oh and love will see us through
If only you trust in me
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Why don't you, you come to me?
When things go wrong, cling to me
And whoa, and I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along
Oh, if only you trust in me
