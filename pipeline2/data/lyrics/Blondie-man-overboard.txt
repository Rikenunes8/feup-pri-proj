[Chorus]
Man overboard, sinking in a sea of love
Man overboard, he jumped, didn't need a shove
Oh, I've been sailing the sea of love, experiencing romance
With what I know (With what I know), he never stood a chance (Ooh, ooh)
He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
[Chorus]
Said, "Lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love
Lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love"
Yeah, I've been sailing the sea of love, experiencing romance
With what I know (With what I know), he never stood a chance
[Break]
No, man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard
Throw him a line
Man overboard
[Outro]
He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
(He gave it) He gave it all for love
(Man overboard, he gave it) He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
(He gave it) He gave it all for love
(Man overboard, he gave it) He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
(He gave it) He gave it all for love (Man overboard)
(He gave it)
