[Verse 1]
Darling, darling, darling
I can't wait to see you
Your picture ain't enough
I can't wait to touch you in the flesh (Ooh)
Darling, darling, darling (Darling)
I can't wait to hear you
Remembering your love (Ooh)
Is nothing without you in the flesh
[Bridge]
Went walking one day on the lower East side
Met you with a girlfriend, you were so divine
She said, "Hands off this one sweetie, this boy is mine"
I couldn't resist you, I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind
[Verse 2]
Darling, darling, darling (Darling)
Now you're out of town
Those girls that you run with (Ooh)
They bring my head down
Ooh, darling (Darling) darling (Darling)
Watch out if I see you
'Cause if you say, "Hello"
It'll mean you want to see me in the flesh
[Outro]
Ooh, warm and soft, in the flesh
Ooh, close and hot, in the flesh
Ooh
