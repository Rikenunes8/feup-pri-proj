[Verse 1]
Sitting on the hillside
Watching all the people die
I'll feel much better on the other side
I'll thumb a ride
[Verse 2]
I believe in magic
Why? Because it is so quick
I don't need power when I'm hypnotized
Look in my eyes
What are you seeing? (I see...)
How do you feel?
I'll feel real phony when my name is Phil
Or was that Bill?
[Verse 3]
(Sha-la-lala-lala-lala-lah)
Life goes on here
(Sha-la-lala-lala-lala-lah)
Day after day
I don't know if I am living or if I'm
Supposed to be
Sometimes my life is so eerie
And if you think I'm happy
Paint me (white)(yellow)(pink)[Verse 4]
(Sha-la-lala-lala-lala-lah)
I've been here once
(Sha-la-lala-lala-lala-lah)
I've been here twice
I don't know if the third's the fourth or if the
The fifth's to fix
Sometimes I deal with numbers
And if you wanna count me
Count me (out)(in)
[Verse 5]
I don't need the times of day
Any time with me's OK
I just don't want you using up my time
'Cause that's not right
[Outro]
Ahh...
Ahh...
Ahh...
They're locking them up today
They're throwing away the key
I wonder who it will be tomorrow, you or me?
They're locking them up today
They're throwing away the key
I wonder who it'll be tomorrow, you or me?
They're locking them up today
They're throwing away the key
I wonder who it will be tomorrow, you or me?
We're all normal and we want our freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
I want my freedom
All of God's childrens gotta have their freedom
