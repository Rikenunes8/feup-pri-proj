[Verse 1]
You've been around enough to know
That if I want to leave, you better let me go
Because I take full advantage of every man I meet
[Chorus]
I get away almost every day
With what the girls call, what the girls call
What the girls call, the girls call murder
[Verse 2]
You've been around enough to see
That if you think you're it, you better check with me
Because I take full advantage of every man I meet
[Chorus]
I get away almost every day
With what the girls call, what the girls call
What the girls call, the girls call murder
