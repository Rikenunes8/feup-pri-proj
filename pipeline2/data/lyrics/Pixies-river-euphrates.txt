[Chorus 1]
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
[Verse 1]
Stuck here out of gas
Out here on the Gaza Strip
From driving in too fast
Two, three
[Chorus 2]
Let's ride a tire down the river Euphrates
Let's ride a tire
Let's ride a tire down the river Euphrates
Ride a tire
Ride a tire down the river Euphrates
Ride a tire
[Chorus 1]
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
[Verse 2]
Dead Sea make me float
One sip from the salty wine
Dead Sea make you choke
Two, three
[Chorus 2]
Let's ride a tire down the river Euphrates
Let's ride a tire
Let's ride a tire down the river Euphrates
Ride a tire
Let's ride a tire down the river Euphrates
Let's ride a tire[Outro]
Ride
A
Tire
