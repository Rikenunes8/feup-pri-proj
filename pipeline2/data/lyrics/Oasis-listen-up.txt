[Verse 1]
Listen up
What's the time said today
I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I wanna see my crime
Day by day
There's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think and the words
They won't let you say
[Pre-Chorus]
One fine day gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time
[Chorus 1]
Sailing down a river alone
I've been trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own

No, I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
