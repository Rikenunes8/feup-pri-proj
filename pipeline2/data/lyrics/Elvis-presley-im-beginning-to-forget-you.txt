I'm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
I'm beginning to sleep at night
No more crying 'till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
I'm beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
I'm beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And it's just another song
I'm so happy that it's over
I'm so thankful to be free
I'm beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
