[Chorus]
Baby, please stay
Don't go away, baby
Don't go away, please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away, don't go away
Don't go away
[Verse 1]
I'm asking you, darling
Please stay, please stay, please
Don't go away, baby
Please stay baby, please
Don't go away, no
I couldn't stand it, darling
I won't be able to sleep peacefully
In bed without you beside me darling, darling anymore
No sugar, no I won't be warm and secure
Oh baby, baby, baby, like I was before
Oh, baby
I'll just lie tossing and turning, baby, baby, baby
(Tossing and turning, tossing and turning)
All night long scared that if I closed my eyes
When I got ready to wake up I might find you gone
[Chorus]
Baby, please stay
Don't go away, baby
Don't go away, please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away, don't go away
Don't go away
[Verse 2]
For I never felt this way before
No, no sugar you did it
Oh I never felt so good, honey before
Oh I never felt so good, oh before
Oh sugar, cause you dig it, you got it
Oh I never felt so good
Oh I love you, I just love you
[Outro]
Oh now I never felt so good before
I love ya
Oh now I never felt so good before
I never could come this way before, baby oh oh
I never could come this way before, baby oh oh
