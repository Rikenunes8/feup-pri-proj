[Verse 1]
Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you, ooh-hoo
[Verse 2]
Won't you tell your dad get off my back?
Tell him what we said about "Paint It, Black"
Rock and roll is here to stay
, 
come inside, well, it's okay
And I'll shake you, ooh-hoo
[Verse 3]
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, then let me know, if it's no, then I can go
I won't make you, ooh-hoo
