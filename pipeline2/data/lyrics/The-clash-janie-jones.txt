[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock 'n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned, whoa
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no
He's in love with the rock 'n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned, whoa
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no
[Verse 1]
And he knows what he got to do
He knows he's gonna have fun with you
You lucky lady
And he knows when the evenin' comes
When his job is done he'll be over in his car for you
[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock 'n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned, whoa
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no
[Verse 2]
In the in-tray lots of work
But the boss at the firm always thinks he shirks
But he's just like everyone, he got a Ford Cortina
That just won't run without fuel
Fill her up, Jacko
[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock 'n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned, whoa
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no
[Verse 3]
And the invoice, it don't quite fit
No payola in his alphabetical file
'Cept for the government, man
And he's just gonna really tell the boss
He's gonna really let him know exactly how he feels
It's pretty bad[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock 'n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned, whoa
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no
[Outro]
No
No
Let them know
Let them know
