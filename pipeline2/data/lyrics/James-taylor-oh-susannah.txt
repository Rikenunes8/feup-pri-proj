[Verse 1]
Well I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee
And I'm bound for Louisiana
My own true love for to see
[Verse 2]
It did rain all night the day I left
The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
[Chorus]
I said, oh! Susanna
Now you don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama
With this banjo on my knee
[Verse 3]
Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
[Verse 4]
Now the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
The tear was in her eye
I said that I come from Dixie Land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry[Chorus]
