Do you wanna dance

Tell me, baby, I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Hold me, baby, all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
