[Chorus 1]
Baby, we went last winter
And the ground was covered with snow
Yes, we went last winter, baby
And the ground was covered with snow
[Bridge]
I didn't have no money in my pocket, darling
Shout aloud and have no place to go
[Chorus 2]
Well, it seems like I was going crazy sometime
I didn't know what to do
Yes, it seems like I was going crazy sometime
Baby, I didn't know what to do
[Bridge]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning
Shout and laid down with the blues
[Chorus 3]
Well, I finally got a break, baby
Easy things are coming my way
Yeah, I finally got a break, baby
Easy things are coming my way
[Outro]
I've got money in my pocket, darling
Yes, I can change clothes everyday
