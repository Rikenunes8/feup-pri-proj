Pull back the cover
Shades, good God
It's a raid
Cut off the lights
And call the law
Cut off the lights
And call the law
Standing over there
The devil's Son In Law
Call the law
Call the law
The devil's son-in-law
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Make me sweat
Still good
It's still good
Still good
It's still good
Turn over
Turn over
Soulful rover
Turn over
Turn over
Turn over
Take me in the change
Take me in the change
Take me in the change
Honky-tonk women
Is all I need
Honky-tonk women
Is what I wantFellas, one more time
I wanna give the drummer
Some of this funky soul we got here
You don't have to do no solo-ing, brother
Just keep what you got
Don't turn it loose
'Cause it's a mother
When I count to four
I want everybody to lay off
Let the drummer go
When I count to four
I want you to come back in
I got to holler
I said, it's in my feet
Feels so sweet
It's in my shake, good God
About to work me to death
It's in my shirt
About to work me to death
It's in my shirt
I'm about to blow
I'm about to blowOne, two, three, four
Get it
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
One, two, three, four
The name of this tune is 'The Funky Drummer'
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
