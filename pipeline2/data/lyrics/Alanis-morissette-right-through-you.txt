[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, man
You mispronounced my name
You didn't wait for all the information
Before you turned me away
Wait a minute, sir
You kind of hurt my feelings
You see me as a sweet back-loaded puppet
And you've got meal ticket taste
[Chorus]
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you
[Verse 2]
You took me for a joke
You took me for a child
You took a long hard look at my ass
And then played golf for a while
Your shake is like a fish
You pat me on the head
You took me out to wine, dine, 69 me
But didn't hear a damn word I said
[Chorus]
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you (Woo)
[Verse 3]
Oh, hello, Mr. Man
You didn't think I'd come back
You didn't think I'd show up with my army
And this ammunition on my back
Now that I'm Miss Thing
Now that I'm a zillionaire
You scan the credits for your name
And wonder why it's not there[Chorus]
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you, you
