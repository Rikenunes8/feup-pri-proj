[Verse 1]
Little Miss Lover
Where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover
That feels like you, would you like to tag along?
Well, I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Aw, sucker today
[Verse 2]
Would you believe baby
I've been looking for a soul that feels like you
For some time
Excuse me while I see
If the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind
Well, he signals me ok
So I think it's safe to say
I'm going to make a play
Aw, yeah
[Bridge]
You see me walk towards you baby
Hey, aw yeah
Aw, give it to her!
Oh, get into it
[Outro]
Hey, hey, little miss lover
Well now, there's so much
You and me can discover
And I think we should start
(Hey, little miss lover)
See we should start right now, baby, hey, hey
(Hey, little miss lover)
Little miss, little miss, little miss lover
(Hey, little miss lover)
Oh baby, oh, look at me and say
(Hey, little miss lover)
So good, little miss lover
(Hey, little miss lover)
Hey baby
(Hey, little miss lover)
Go, it is very man good
(Hey, little miss lover)
Hey, lover
