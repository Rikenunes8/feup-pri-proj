[Verse 1]
In my head, I found you there
And running around and following me
But you don't dare
But I find that I have now more than I ever wanted to
[Chorus]
So maybe Thomas Jefferson wasn't born
In your back yard like you have said
And maybe I'm just the horizon you run to
When she has left you there
[Verse 2]
You are here in my head
And running around and calling me
"Come back, I'll show you the roses that brush off the snow
And open their petals again and again"
And you know that 
apple green ice cream
Can melt in your hands, I can't
So I held your hand at the fair
And even forgot what time it was
[Chorus]
And even if Thomas Jefferson wasn't born
In your back yard like you have said
And maybe I'm just the horizon you run to
When she has left you and me here alone on the floor
[Bridge]
You're counting my feathers as the bells toll
You see the bow and belt and 
the girl from the south
All favorites of mine, you know them all well
And spring brings fresh little puddles
That makes it all clear, makes it all
Do you know, hey?
Do you know what this is doing to me?
[Outro]
Here
Here
Here
Here in my head
