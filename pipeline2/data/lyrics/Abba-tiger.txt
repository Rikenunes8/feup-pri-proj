[Verse 1]
The city is a jungle, you'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me
[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Verse 2]
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me
[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Post-Chorus]
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Verse 3]
The city is a prison, you'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Post-Chorus]
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Outro]
And if I meet you, what if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger, tiger, tiger
