1,2,1,2,3
Well the clouds roll by in the big blue sky
As the sun beats down on Casa Dega
And the moon pulls the tide and the tide brings night
But night is more than just night in Casa Dega
Oh baby I think I'm starting to believe the things that I've heard
'Cause tonight in Casa Dega I hang on every word
She said to me as she holds my hand
And reads the lines of a stranger
And she knows my name, yeah she knows my plans
In the past in the present and for the future
Yeah, baby now think I'm starting to believe the things that I've heard
'Cause tonight in Casa Dega I hang on every word
Then she said...
Oh
Naw yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Uh huh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah baby
More than just a night in Casa Dega
