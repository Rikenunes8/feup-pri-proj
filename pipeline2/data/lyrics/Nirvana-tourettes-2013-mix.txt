[Intro]
"Moderate Rock"
[Verse 1]
May day, every day, my day
Could've had a heart attack, my heart
We don't know anything, my heart
We all want something fair, my heart
[Interlude]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
[Verse 2]
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, not today, my heart
One more on the phone, my heart
One more at the door of my heart
[Interlude]
Hey
Hey
Hey
[Outro]
Mean heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
