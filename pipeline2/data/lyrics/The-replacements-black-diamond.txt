[Intro]
Out on the street for a living
You know it's only begun (ooh ooh ooh)
They've got you under their thumb
[Verse 1]
Out on the street for a living
Gee, it's only begun
Doing everything I can, babe
And now you're under their thumb
[Chorus]
Ooh, black diamond
Ooh, black diamond
[Verse 2]
Out on the street for a country
And it's only a dream
Got other people marching
And it's only a way
[Chorus]
Ooh, black diamond
Ooh, black diamond
[Verse 3]
Out on the street for a living
And it's only begun
Regardless a street or a country
They got you under their thumb
[Chorus]
Ooh, black diamond
Ooh, black diamond
