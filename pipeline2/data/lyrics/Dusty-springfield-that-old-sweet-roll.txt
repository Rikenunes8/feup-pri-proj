Hi-de-ho, hi-de-hi
Gonna find me a piece of the sky
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Singing hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-ho
Listen, I've been down so low
That the bottom looked like up
Once I felt like second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I've offered all I have
But it ain't no way to live
Being taken by the ones who have
The least amount to give
Singing hi-de-ho, hi-de-hi
Got to find me a piece of the sky
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Singing hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho
I wanna tell you
Once I met the devil
He was mighty slick
Tempted me with worldly goods
Said I could have my pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And showed me where to sign
I said "Thank you very kindly
But I'm in too great a need of mine"
Singing hi-de-ho, hi-de-hi, oh
Got to find me a piece of that sky
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Singing hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho, yeah
Hi-de-hi-de-ho
Hi-de-hi-de-ho, yeah
Hi-de-hi-de-ho
Hi-de-hi-de-hi
Talking 'bout hi-de-hi-de-ho
