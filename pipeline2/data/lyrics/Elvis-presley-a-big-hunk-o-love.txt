[Intro]
Hey baby, I ain't asking much of you
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do
[Verse 1]
Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Now you can spare a kiss or two and
Still have plenty left, no no no
Baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do
[Verse 2]
You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
But I ain't greedy, baby
All I want is all you got, no no no
I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do
[Verse 3]
I got a wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist
You know I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
If you give me just a one sweet kiss
Oh no no no no no no no no
Baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do, that's right
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do, that's right
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do, that's right
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love
