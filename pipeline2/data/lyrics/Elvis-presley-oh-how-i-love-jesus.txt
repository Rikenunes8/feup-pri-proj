Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
When I am discouraged
And I feel the gloom
God sends His angel
To see Him my broom
IU hear the singing
I'm satisfied
I know, I know
That Jesus is mine
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
To know that Jesus is mine
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)
To know that Jesus is mine
