And if you can't think of anything, then you gonna drink 'n think it later
(I can see, I can see, I can see, I ah)
Later, before you go
And then you go baby, you're gonna think what you coulda done better
So come on, let it go, take it all
(I can see, I can see, I can see, I ah)
Your baby got a postage in the line
Turn up later at your bicenten where you think about dad and you think about death
(I can see, I can see, I can see, I ah)
Everybody looks like a stair with the miles between us, spit in the wind till he winds the tiller
(I can see, I can see, I can see, I ah)
When you make bartender with an eighty eight track and everybody laughs in the middle of the chair
(I can see, I can see, I can see, I ah)
You get a little special at shakin' your ass in that class, it's not gon' make you better - okay?
(I can see, I can see, I can see, I ah)

Keep it under your best friend's arms
Keep it under your best friend's arms
Keep it under your best friend's arms
Keep it under your best friend's arms
Keep it under your best friend's arms
Keep it under your best friend's arms
