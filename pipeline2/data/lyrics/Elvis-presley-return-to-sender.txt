[Intro]
Return to sender
Return to sender
[Verse 1]
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it in his sack
Bright and early next morning
He brought my letter back
[Chorus]
(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone
We had a quarrel
A lover's spat
I write, "I'm sorry"
But my letter keeps coming back
[Verse 2]
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning
It came right back to me
[Chorus]
(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such person
No such zone
[Bridge]
This time, I'm gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day
Then I'll understand
[Chorus]
(The writing on it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone[Outro]
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
