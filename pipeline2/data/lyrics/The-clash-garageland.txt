[Verse 1]
Back in the garage with my bullshit detector
Carbon monoxide makin' sure it's effective
People ringin' up makin' offers for my life
I just want to stay in the garage all night
[Chorus]
We're a garage band
(Oh-oh-oh)
We come from Garageland
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
Meanwhile things are hottin' up in the West End alright
Contracts in the offices, groups in the night
My bumming slumming friends have all got new boots
And someone just asked me if the group would wear suits
[Chorus]
We're a garage band
(Oh-oh-oh)
We come from Garageland
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna hear about what the rich are doin'
I don't wanna go to where, where the rich are goin'
They think they're so clever, they think they're so right
But the truth is only known by guttersnipes
[Chorus]
We're a garage band
(Oh-oh-oh)
We come from Garageland
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)[Bridge]
Twenty-two singers
One microphone
Back in the garage
Five guitar players
One guitar
Back in the garage
Complaints, complaints
What an old bag
[Outro]
Back in the garage
Back in the garage
Back in the garage
