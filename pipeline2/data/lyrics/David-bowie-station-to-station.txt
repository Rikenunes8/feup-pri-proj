[Intro]
[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, 
dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon
From station to station
[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near
[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
