Rama lama fa fa fa
After some good tokes and a six pack
We can sock 'em out for you till you're flat on your back
You know I got to keep it up 'cause I'm a natural man
I'm a born hell raiser and I don't give a damn
I'm the man for you baby
Yes I am for you baby
Say I'm the man for you baby
Yes I am for you baby, I'm the man for you
Yes I'm a baby, I'm not here
'Cause I'm only there
Workin' here before your momma soakin' wet
You think you're satisfied you ain't seen nothing yet
I said "A wham bam thank you ma'am
I'm a born hell raiser and I don't give a damn"
I'm the man for you baby
Yes I am for you baby
Say I'm the man for you baby
Yes I am for you baby, I'm the man for you
Yes I'm a baby, I'm not here
'Cause I'm only there and I'm gonna think about
Rama lama fa fa fa
Rama lama fa fa fa
Rama lama fa fa fa
You can lay it down on me, baby, any old time
We can shimmy so good we'll both be stoned of mind
I got to keep it up 'cause I'm a natural man
I'm irresistibly bad and I kick out the jam
I'm the man for you baby
Yes I am for you baby
Say I'm the man for you baby
Yes I am for you baby, I'm the man for you
Yes I'm, I'm over there I'm not here
Yes I'm, I'm over there I'm not here
Yes I'm, yes I am
