[Verse 1]
Step in these arms
Where you belong
It feels so right, so right
How can it be wrong?
There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me wanna hold you tight
I know that nothing can be wrong
That feels so right, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
Each time we touch
You thrill me so
It means so much, so much
I can't let you go, yeah
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life through
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong?
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life long
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong?
Oh, yeah
