[Verse 1]
Dear old sun
How you holding up?
Through the winter cold
Up there all alone
February's been hard on a heart
But we're near the end
And it's almost March
Though the sky's been grey
And in our way I still see your light
[Verse 2]
Well, you melt the snow
And you grow the roses
And you dry the tears
And you freckle noses
Our little world
Revolves around you
Coming up and going down
[Chorus 1]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 3]
Dear old sun
Let's call it a day
And I watch you set
I'll let you rest
But I'll wait for you
Like morningâ€™s dew
'Til I see your light[Chorus 1]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oohh ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus 2]
I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your light
I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your light
