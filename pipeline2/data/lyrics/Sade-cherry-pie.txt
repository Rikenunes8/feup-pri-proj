[Intro]
Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
Got to find out what I'm meant to do
You're the one who broke my heart
[Verse 1]
When I met you, boy
You were as sweet as cherry pie
That smile in your eye
You were as wild as Friday night
I should have known
However hard you tried
Change would come and strangle it
It was bound to die
[Chorus]
You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
[Bridge]
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Oh, boy
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you?
[Verse 2]
You gave me your soul
For at least a day
Listen, boy, there was a time
When I wanted you to stay
You know the cost
It's you who's gonna pay
I'm stronger now; I loved you then
I ask you anyway
[Chorus]
You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night[Bridge]
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you, boy?
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Ooh, I needed you
Baa doo doo doo doo, doo doo, baa doo doo doo
Baa doo doo doo doo (You tease me), baa doo doo doo
Baa doo doo doo doo, doo doo (You broke my heart)
Baa doo doo doo
Baa doo doo doo doo (You broke my heart)
Baa doo doo doo
Hoo hoo, ooh hoo
You were the only one, you were the only one
You're a son of a gun
You were the only one, you were the only one
Oh boy, you broke my heart
Sweet as cherry pie
Sweet as cherry pie
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Oh, boy
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Where were you just when I needed you?
Gotta find out what I meant to you, boyDoo doop doo doop
Doo doop doo doop

[Outro]
Where were you when I needed you?
You were the only one, you were the only one
Ooh, son of a gun
You were the only one
I'm feeling stronger now; I loved you then
So I ask you anyway
Gotta find out what I meant to you
(Sweet as cherry pie)
You broke my heart
(Sweet as cherry pie)
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You tease me
You were the only one, you were the only one
Wild as Friday night
Son of a gun
You were the only one, you were the only one
(Sweet as cherry pie)
