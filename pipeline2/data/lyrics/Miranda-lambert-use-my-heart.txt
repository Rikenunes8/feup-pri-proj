[Verse 1]
I can throw a line but I can't reel it in
I can throw a dart but I can't make it stick
[Chorus]
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
[Verse 2]
I can write the line but I can't sing the song
I can call my mama but I won't go home
[Chorus]
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
[Bridge]
I won't throw a punch but I will turn my cheek
I don't go to church no more but that's what I believe
[Verse 3]
I don't give two shits no more or so I say
It wouldn't make a difference to you anyway
[Chorus]
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
[Outro]
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
Use my heart
