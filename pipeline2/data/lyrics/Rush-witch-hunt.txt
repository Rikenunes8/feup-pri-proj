[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
The night is black, without a moon
The air is thick and still
The vigilantes gather on
The lonely torch-lit hill
[Verse 2]
Features distorted in the flickering light
Faces are twisted and grotesque
Silent and stern in the sweltering night
The mob moves like demons possessed
Quiet in conscience, calm in their right
Confident their ways are best
Oh, oh!
[Verse 3]
The righteous rise with burning eyes
Of hatred and ill-will
Madmen fed on fear and lies
To beat and burn and kill
[Verse 4]
They say there are strangers who threaten us
Our immigrants and infidels
They say there is strangeness to danger us
In our theaters and bookstore shelves
That those who know what's best for us
Must rise and save us from ourselves!
[Verse 5]
Quick to judge, quick to anger
Slow to understand
Ignorance and prejudice
And fear walk hand in hand
