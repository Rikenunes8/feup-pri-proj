[Intro]
Oo la, la, la, oo la, la, la, la
[Verse 1]
Emily and her love to be
Carved in a heart on a berry tree
But it's only a little farewell love spell
Time to design a woman
Touch me, oh wake me
Emily you ornament the earth for me
[Verse 2]
Emily, you're the natural snow, the natural snow
The unstudied sea, you're a cameo
And I swear, I swear you were born a weaver's lover
Born for the loom's desire
Move me, oh sway me
Emily, you ornament the earth for me
[Bridge]
Emmie, your Mama's been a-calling you ooh
Who stole Mama's heart and cuddled in her garden?
Darling Emmie
La, la, la, oo la la la, oo la la la, oo la la la
You were my friend and I loved you
[Outro]
Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
She got the way to move me, Emmie
She got the way to move me, yeah
She got the way to move me, Emmie
She got the way to get up and move me
She got the way to move me, Emmie
She got the way to move me, yeah
She got the way to move me, Emmie
She got the way to get up and move me
