[Chorus]
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
[Verse 1]
All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
But now I see there's joy inside your heart
Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth
[Chorus]
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
(that's what you told me, yeah)
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
(that's the way it will always be)
Ever since the day you came inside my life[Bridge]
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you...
[Harmonizing]
[Chorus]
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
(baby, that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
(that's what you said it would be)
If I should ever bring you inside my life
[Bridge]
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you...
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you[Chorus]
Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said that I would be
(baby, that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life, yeah
Happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
(that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life
[Outro]
I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happy happy, happy
