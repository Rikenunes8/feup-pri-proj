[Verse 1]
It's just a look
And it makes the boys quiver
Yes, it's the look
And now they remember
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Had they forgotten
What this all means?
I think they want to forget
And they hope that this time
Not this time
[Chorus]
I won't look
I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was
I've got to get to work now
They set an example for us, I see it
It can happen to me too
And it didn't make any difference to us
But I forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble and that's the trouble
With our love
With our love
With our love
[Verse 2]
They hear the words
Such as "you're really special"
And they can't face that feeling
And they can't really tell
I look out the window, and I
I call that education, and I
I see all my friends standing out there, and I
I call that educationâ€”sophistication
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They're not so busy
That they won't be affected
Because things come and go and I see 'em
But I won't be neglected
Not this time[Chorus]
I won't look
I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was
I've got to get to work now
They set an example for us, I see it
It can happen to me too
And it
Didn't make any difference to us
But I forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble and that's the trouble
With our love
With our love
With our love
