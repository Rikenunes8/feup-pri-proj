[Verse 1: David Lee Roth]
Turn your radios on
I'll appear right there, yes I will
Turn me up real loud
I'm in your ears
[Pre-Chorus: David Lee Roth]
'N' I'm hangin' ten now, baby
As I ride your sonic—ooh, wave
(Good God, y'all)
[Chorus: David Lee Roth & Michael Anthony]
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
[Interlude: David Lee Roth]
Oh yeah
One time
[Bridge: David Lee Roth & Michael Anthony]
Fire
Fire, fire
[Guitar Solo: Eddie Van Halen]
Ow!
Whoo!
Ow! (Ah-ha)
Whoo, whoo
[Verse 2: David Lee Roth]
Lay your bodies down
I'm in your beds, your beds
Pull your headphones on
I'm in your heads, ah[Pre-Chorus: David Lee Roth]
'N' I'm hangin' ten now, baby
As I ride your sonic—ooh, wave
(Good God, y'all)
Ahh!
[Chorus: David Lee Roth & Michael Anthony]
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire (Oh!)
I'm on fire (Whoo, whoo)
I'm on fire (Whoo, whoo)
I'm on fire (Ooh)
I'm on fire (Ooh)
I'm on fire
Ow!
