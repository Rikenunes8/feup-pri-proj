[Chorus: 
The Supremes
]
The, The, The, The!
Tears!
Keep rolling down my cheeks
I cry each time I try to speak
[Verse One: Mary Wilson]
Don't you know I miss you so-oh?
Baby, please come home-oh
Dry these teardrops in my eye
Baby, then you'll realize
I miss you so!
[Chorus: Mary Wilson & 
The Supremes
]
That's why the... 
tears!
Keep rolling down my cheeks
I cry each time I try to speak
Don't you know I miss you so?
[Verse Two: Mary Wilson & 
The Supremes
]
Ahh...
I miss you more every day 
Ahh
The flowers could miss the rain 
Rain rain
If it never rained again 
Rain rain
I'm tellin' you 
Ahh
I'm really blue 
Ahh
You said goodbye
And, baby, that's why the...
[Chorus / Outro: 
The Supremes
]
Tears!
Keep rolling down my cheeks
I cry each time I try to speak
Don't you know I miss you so?
Don't you know I miss you so?
Don't you know I miss you so!
