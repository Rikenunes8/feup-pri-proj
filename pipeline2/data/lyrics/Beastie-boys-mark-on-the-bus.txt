Good morning
Time to get up and go to work
I ride on the bus into the city every day
I sit on my seat and I dream myself away
I dream I'm on an island with that foxy lady too
But when I awaken, I must be mistaken, 
I'm on Third Avenue
Won't you take me away and take away me
Won't you take me away and take away me
Yeaaah
Alright, get off the bus
"You're wild man... WILD!"
"That's insane, you're stupid"
(Huh?)
"You should sleep late man;
It's just much easier on your constitution"
