Some folks are born, made to wave the flag
Ooh, that red, white and blue
And when the band plays, "Hail To The Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, Lord
Some folks are born, silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, y'all
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house look-ah like a rummage sale, yes-ah
Uh-it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, Lord, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, Lord
Yeah, yeah, some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
Ooh, they'll send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer, "More, more, more" y'all
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, son, son-ah
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one, y'all
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one, y'all
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son, no, no, no
