[Intro]
I say
[Chorus: KRS-One]
The bridge is over, the bridge is over
, biddy-bye-bye
The bridge is over, the bridge is over
, hey, hey
The bridge is over, the bridge is over
, biddy-bye-bye
The bridge is over, the bridge is over
[Verse 1: KRS-One]
You see me coming in di dance with the spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well, you must see me
You can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl, dem a rhyming like they gay
Picking up the mic, man, dem don't know what to say
Saying hip-hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, man, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan
Tell them again, me come to tell them again
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan
Tell them again, me come to tell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it and Queens keeps on faking it
[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Di-di, di-da, di-di-di, di-da, di-day, ayy
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play? 'Cause
Here's an example of KRS-One (Buck)
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP, but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock, 'cause
We don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions come in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out, he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shanté is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said, "I tell you now, you ain't nothing"
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now, man, I me say easy now, man
To KRS-One, you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
The name of this routine is called "Live At Union Square"
Square, square, square, ooh
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't you know that he's out of touch?
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking 'bout your wack Puma sneaker
'Cause Bronx created hip-hop,
 
Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking 'bout the Juice Crew funny
But you're still telling lies to me
