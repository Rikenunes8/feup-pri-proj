[Verse 1]
What 
moonsongs
Do you sing your babies?
What sunshine do you bring?
Who belongs?
Who decides who's crazy?
Who rights wrongs where others cling?
[Chorus]
I'll sing for you
If you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break
[Verse 2]
I go along
Just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you
And those moonsongs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through
[Chorus]
I'll hear your song
If you want me to
I'll sing along
And it’s a chance I'll have to take
And it’s a chance I'll have to break
[Outro]
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
(So in love)
I'm in love with you
(With you)
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
(So in love)
I'm in love with you
(I'm so in love)
I'm in love with you
With you
