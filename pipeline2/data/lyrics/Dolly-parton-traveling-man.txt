[Verse 1]
The man I loved ran a salesman route
Selling goods from house to house
Now I knew my mama would never stand
For me stepping out with no traveling man
Mama bought things that he was a'selling
But mama didn't know and I sure wasn't telling
That behind her back I was making plans
To meet somewhere with that traveling man
Oh the traveling man was a good bit older
But a girl needs arms to hold her
Mama didn't know because I didn't told her
But mama wouldn't understand
Me stepping out with a traveling man
[Verse 2]
Mama didn't allow me going courting
And I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn't
Oh but she'd give me the back her hand
If she'd seen me with that traveling man
So I tell my mama that I reckon I ought to
Go to the spring and fetch us some water
What mama didn't know is I had a plan
To meet down there with that traveling man
[Verse 3]
Now I make plans to run away
With that traveling man on a Saturday
Well Saturday's here and here I stand
And there goes my mama with that traveling man
[Verse 4]
Oh that traveling man was a two-time lover
He took my love then he took my mother
But I didn't know because mama didn't told me and I don't understand
My mama running off with my traveling man
[Verse 5]
Mama, you know you oughtn't done that
You just like my daddy
He run off before I ever know him
You done run-off with my traveling man
And I really don't think I ever know you either
Oh there goes my mama with my traveling man
And I'm really going to miss that traveling man
Mm-hm
