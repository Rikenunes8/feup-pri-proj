[Chorus]
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
[Verse 1]
Row da boat straight to da ocean
Give him a run a run at his own game
Signal the plane an' I landed on the runway
A survivor, independent foreigner
First your beats had me running to the running man
Then your chat had me wanna do the boogie man
Click suits and booted in the Timbaland
Freakin' out to Missy on a Timbaland
[Chorus]
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
[Verse 2]
You shoulda been good to me
Then I wouldn't get so rowdy rowdy
You shoulda kept ya eye on me
Then I wouldn't get so baddy baddy
Whether you are swingin' out to swing beat
Laying low and jacking up to Lou Reed
Chasin' out to Pixies and the Beasties
Doin' acid with hair colored geek freaks
Fast forward onto the' 04
Got my own flow get you to the dance floor
Little mamma doin' the booty rolls
Crump clowns got me rootin' for the linos[Chorus]
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, popGrowin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Growin' up, brewin' up
Guerrilla gettin' trained up
Look out, look out
From over the rooftop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
Competition coming up now
Load up, aim, fire, fire, pop
[Outro]
Fire, fire, pop
