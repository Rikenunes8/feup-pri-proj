[Chorus]
I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it
Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compare
[Verse 1]
Gimme some love to fill me up
Gimme some time, gimme some stuff
Gimme a sign, gimme some kind of reason
Are you heavy enough to make me stay
I feel like I might blow away
I thought I was in Heaven
But I was only dreaming
[Chorus]
I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it
Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compare
[Verse 2]
I just wanna live the life I please
I don't want no enemies
I don't want nothin' if i have to fake it
Never take nothin' don't belong to me
Everything's paid for, nothing's free
If I give my heart
Will you promise not to break it?
[Chorus]
I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it
Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compareMoney can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compare
