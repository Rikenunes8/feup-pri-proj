[Verse 1]
I don't care what you've said
And I mean it
I don't care what you've shared
'Cause I've seen it
Who's to judge if you're wrong?
This is a bad time
Just as long as you break his heart
And not mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell him you're a liar, tell him I'm a saint
Say it's much too early or just too late
Tell him that you're weak, beg him to be strong
Say you're very sorry, but you were wrong
[Chorus]
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
[Verse 2]
It's a fatal mistake
And you know it
That you're dying to make
You'll pay for it
It's already too late
Go on admit it
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell him it's a problem, tell him it's too hard
Say you phoned your best friend and Scotland Yard
Swear that there'll be murder, tell him that I'm ill
Say you know it's blackmail, but that I'll kill
[Chorus]
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
That I need to love you[Chorus]
Do I have to? Oh, don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
[Bridge]
I know what you've said about me
I heard, but do I have to plead?
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
[Chorus]
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
That I need to love you
[Outro]
Do I have to?
Do I have to?
Don't say
Do I have to...
...love you?
