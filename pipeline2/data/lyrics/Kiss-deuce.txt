[Verse 1]
Get up and get your grandma out of here
Pick up, old Jim is working hard this year
And, baby, do the things he says to do
[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling good
And, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce
[Verse 2]
Honey, don't push your man behind his years
And, baby, stop crying all your tears
Baby, do the things he says to do
(Do it)
[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce
[Instrumental break 1:42-2:12]
[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
[Outro]
Yeah!
