[Verse 1]
I love the way you walk
Don't you know you're a cool motivator
Love the way you walk
Love the way you walk
[Verse 2]
I love the way your eye
It doth shine like an Egyptian ruby
Love the way it shines
Love the way it shines
Shine on
[Verse 3]
I love the clothes you wear
They're so mean they're so free they're so handsome
Love the clothes you wear
Love the clothes you wear
[Verse 4]
I love the broken crown
The one you stole from the King and held for ransom
Love the broken crown
Love the broken crown
Love it
[Verse 5]
I love the golden cat
You know the one that you keep
In your bedroom
Love the golden cat
Love the golden cat
[Verse 6]
I love the velvet hat
You know the one that caused
A revolution
Love the velvet hat
Love the velvet hat
I love it
