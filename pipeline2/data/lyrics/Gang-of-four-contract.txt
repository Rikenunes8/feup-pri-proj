The same again
Another disagreement
You dreamed of scenes
Like you read of in magazines
A new romance
Invented in the bedroom
Is this so private
Our struggle in the bedroom
Is this really the way it is
Or a contract in our mutual interest
The same again
Another disappointment
We couldn't perform
In the way the other wanted
These social dreams
Put in practise in the bedroom
Is this so private
Our struggle in the bedroom
Is this really the way it is
Or a contract in our mutual interest
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Is this really the way it is
Or a contract in our mutual interest
Is this really the way it is
Or a contract in our mutual interest
