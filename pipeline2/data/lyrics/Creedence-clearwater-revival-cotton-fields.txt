[Verse 1]
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
[Chorus]
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
[Verse 2]
Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
[Chorus]
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
[Verse 1]
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
[Chorus]
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home[Verse 2]
Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
[Chorus]
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
[guitar solo]
[Verse 1]
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
[Chorus]
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
In them old cotton fields back home
