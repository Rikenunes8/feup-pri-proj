Ain't no more cane on the 
Brazos
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's all been ground down to molasses
Oh, oh oh, oh
You shoulda been on the river in nineteen and ten
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They were driving the women just like they drove the men
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Go down old Hannah, don'cha rise no more
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you rise up 'til the judgment day's for sure
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's all been ground down to molasses
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old Shine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Well ya drove that 
bully
 'til he went stone blind
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's all been ground down to molasses
Oh, oh, oh, oh
