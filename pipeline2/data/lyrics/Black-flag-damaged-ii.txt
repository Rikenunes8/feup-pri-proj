[Verse 1]
Damaged by you
Damaged by me
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
[Verse 2]
Stupid attempts
No conclusions
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
[Verse 3]
Put the gun to my head
And I don't pull
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
No longer wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Don't even feel a thing
No longer wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
[Verse 4]
Problems stick
My life drips feelings
Stupid feelings
Stupid illusions
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
[Refrain]
Scars for...
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
My emotions are bruised
[Verse 5]
Wrong in what you think
You don't feel shit[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Don't even feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
[Refrain]
Problems stick
My life drips
Feelings...
Scars! Aah!
[Chorus]
I'm confused
You're wrong
Don't wanna be wrong
[Verse 6]
Stupid incompetence
Stupid in what you think
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Well, you are wrong
I don't wanna be wrong
[Verse 7]
When I talk to you
My mind falls apart
[Chorus]
I'm confused
Confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
No longer wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
[Outro]
Problems... my problems
No longer feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Problems stick, my life!
Feelings... everything I know
