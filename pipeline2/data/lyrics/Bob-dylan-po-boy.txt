[Verse 1]
Man comes to the door, I say, “For whom are you looking?”
He says, “Your wife,” I say, “She’s busy in the kitchen cooking”
Poor boy, where you been?
I already told you, won’t tell you again
[Verse 2]
I say, “How much you want for that?” I go into the store
The man says, “Three dollars.” “All right,” I say, “Will you take four?”
Poor boy, never say die
Things will be all right by and by
[Verse 3]
Been working on the mainline, working like the devil
The game is the same, it’s just up on a different level
Poor boy, dressed in black
Police at your back
[Verse 4]
Poor boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars
Riding first-class trains, making the rounds
Trying to keep from falling between the cars
[Verse 5]
Othello told Desdemona, “I’m cold, cover me with a blanket
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
She said, “I gave it to you, you drank it”
Poor boy, laying them straight, 
picking up the cherries falling off the plate
[Verse 6]
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws
Poor boy, in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom
Calls down to room service, says send up a room
[Verse 7]
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won’t forget him[Verse 8]
All I know is that I’m thrilled by your kiss
I don’t know any more than this
Poor boy, picking up sticks
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks
[Verse 9]
Knocking on the door, I say, “Who is it and where are you from?”
Man says, “Freddy!” I say, “Freddy who?” He says, “Freddy or not here I come”
Poor boy beneath the stars that shine
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine
