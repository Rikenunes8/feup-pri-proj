[Intro]
OW! OW!
[Verse 1]
When your baby and you are tight
And everything you say or do is mellow
She keeps everything all right
And you know that you're the only fellow
[Chorus]
Ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove, ha
Ain't that groove
OW, ain't that a groove
[Verse 2]
Now looka here, fellas
Girls like to be in a mood
Whenever they think their man is yellow
Hit me band
You'll fight real hard to make things right
'Cause he's the only fellow
[Chorus]
Now ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove
Do you hear me people?
Ain't that a groove
OW, ain't the a groove
[Bridge]
Looka here, I want to know, do you love me? (Yes, I love you)
One more time, do you love me (Yes I really, really do)
Do you love me, baby? (Yes, I love you)
I just gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta know
OW! Hit me band
One more 'gain
Looka here
I got to tell you, hahaha, dig this
This will kill you
A little piece of money and plenty of love
Will keep everything together, come on band
Well, forget about the money
Plenty of love, and ain't that mellow[Chorus]
Now ain't that a groove (It's go groovy)
Ain't that a groove (It's so groovy)
Ain't that a groove (It's so groovy)
Hey, OW, ain't that a groove
[Outro]
Looka here, I'm not gonna talk all day
But I, I want you get the feeling
One more time
Hit me band, listen to that band
I wanna ask them
Do you love me? (Yes, I love you)
Do you love me, baby? (Yes, I love you)
Do you love me? Do ya? (Yes, I love you)
I just gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta know
Hey, ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove let me count
One for the money, two for the show
Ain't that a groove, now here we go, going off
And one more thing I want to say
This is better than Christmas
Christmas only comes once a year
And this is all year round, this bookend
I'm livin', let me out, I'm gone, here I go, bye
