[Verse 1]
There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end
[Pre-Chorus 1]
She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin' to keep from feelin' blue
[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh lord)
Tschada dada dada naa [x2]
Come on set me free
(Set me free)
[Verse 2]
There I am so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can’t reveal, I’m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when your feelin' blue
I b'n singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me what should I do
[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh lord)
Tschada dada dada naa [x2]
Come on set me free
(Set me free)[Harmonica Solo]
[Pre-Chorus 3]
She told me she'd be givin' me
A life-time love so guarantee (guarantee)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin', cryin' helplessly
But I’ll keep singin'
[Chorus]
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh lord)
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh my my)
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)
(Woh-oh-oh)
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada naa ('Cos I wanna be free)
Tschada dada dada naa (Hold on, hold on)
Come on set me free
(Set me free)
[Outro]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Wo-oh-oh-oh, Wo-oh-oh-oh, Woo-oh)
Tschada dada dada naa (Woh I, Oh)
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)
(Wo-oh-oh-oh) (Wo-oh-oh-oh)
