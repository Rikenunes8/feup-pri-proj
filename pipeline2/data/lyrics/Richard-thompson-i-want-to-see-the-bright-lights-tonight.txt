[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of working every day
Now the weekend's come I'm gonna throw my troubles away
If you've got the cab fare, mister, you'll do all right
I want to see the bright lights tonight
[Verse 2]
There's crazy people running all over town
There's a silver band just marching up and down
The wide boys are all spoiling for a fight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
[Chorus]
Meet me at the station, don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
[Verse 3]
A couple of drunken nights rolling on the floor
Is just the kind of mess that I'm looking for
I'm gonna dream till Monday comes in sight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
[Chorus]
Meet me at the station, don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
[Outro]
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
