Ah, ha, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side?
I may be climbing up rainbows
But baby, here goes
Ooh, dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wonderin' what this all is leadin' to
I wanna make it with you
I really think that we could make it, ooh
No, you don't know me well
And every little thing only time will tell
But you believe the things that I do
And we'll see it through
Oh, life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I choose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, yeah, yeah, ooh
Ah, ha, and if I choose the one I'd like to help me through
Ooh, hoo, I'd like to make it with you, ah, ha
Ooh, baby, ah, I wanna make it with you
Ooh, let's make it, I wanna make it with you
Ooh, baby, yeah, I wanna make it with you
Ooh, hoo, let's make it, I wanna make it with you
Ah, make it, let's make it
I wanna make it with you
