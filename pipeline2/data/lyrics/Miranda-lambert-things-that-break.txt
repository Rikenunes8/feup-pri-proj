[Verse 1]
I was born a bull in a china cabinet
Drawn to the delicate like it's a magnet
Perfume bottles on a mirror tray
Tempered glass on a window pane
Timeless face on a pocket watch
Time is ticking
[Chorus]
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
[Verse 2]
Can't make a man a promise
With the best of intentions
Drive two hundred miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long enough and you will see
Time is ticking
[Chorus]
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
[Bridge]
Me, I don't ever wanna get too close
Or be held responsible
For all the pain that you can't see
Somebody once broke me
[Chorus]
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
