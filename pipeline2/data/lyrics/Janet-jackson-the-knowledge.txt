[Intro]
(Ooh) Count
One, two, three, four
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Insight to what's goin' on
Information keeps us strong
What you don't know can hurt you bad
Take it from me, you'll be walkin' around sad
Cryin' for a better day
Until you educate for a better way
So if you wanna be in control
Ya gotta get yourself in the know
[Chorus]
Get the knowledge
That you really want
The knowledge
Do you really want?
It's the knowledge
What you really want
The knowledge
That you really want
[Verse 2]
Spreading vice, don't believe the hype
You don't find the knowledge in a pipe
Too many lives go up in smoke
It's nice to laugh but don't be the joke
To get over, get better
I try to be the possessor
Of the one thing we all need in life
To succeed, take my advice
[Chorus]
Get the knowledge (Knowledge)
That you really want
The knowledge (Knowledge)
Do you really want?
It's the knowledge
What you really want (Ooh)
The knowledge (Knowledge)
That you really want[Breakdown]

Knowledge
[Verse 3]
Listen; it's up to everyone
If we're gonna change the way the world is run
The way to start is to rid the children of
Prejudice and ignorance
We've gotta teach our kids to read and write
That's the only way to win the fight for life
Education is the goal so
If you wanna be in the know[Chorus]
Knowledge
One, two, one, two
It's the one thing we all need in life
One, two, one, two
It's the knowledge
Knowledge
That you really want
You really need the knowledge
Do you really want?
It's the knowledge
What you really want
Knowledge
That you really want
One, two
