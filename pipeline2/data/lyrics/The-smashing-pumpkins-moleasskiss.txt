My bed of roses
In this sea of pain
Smoke in those poses
Postures and refrains
A million ways
To break your back
Still undecided if I'm coming back
Hello to you my friends
We'll be together in the end
No doubt about it you can be sure
No doubt about it
To all you buzzards
And debutantes
I give you this reply
Take anything you want
Just know illusion
â€˜cause I'll lose myself again, yeah
Hello to you my friends
We'll be together in the end
No doubt about it you can be sure
No doubt about it
