Saturday night and I'm all alone
No ring on the door bell, no ring on the phone
And nobody wants to know anyone lonely like me
Your boy friend's good looking, he's got it all there
He looks like God made him with something to spare
You look good together, scurrying off down the street
Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me
Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me
He's got the haunt of the sea in his eyes
He wouldn't notice me passing by
I could be in the gutter, or dangling down from a tree
If you know someone who is graceful and wise
Doesn't mind girls who are clumsy and shy
I don't mind going with someone that I've never seen
Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me
Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me
