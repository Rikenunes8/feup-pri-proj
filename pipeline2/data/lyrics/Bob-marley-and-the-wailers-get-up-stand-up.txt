[Intro:  The Wailers]
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
Preacher man don't tell me heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know what life is really worth
It's not all that glitter is gold
 and
Half the story has never been told
So now you see the light, aay
Stand up for your right. Come on
[Chorus: The Wailers and Bob Marley]
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
Most people think great God will come from the sky
Take away everything, and make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth
You would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your right, yeah
[Bridge: The Wailers & (Bob Marley)]
Get up, stand up (Yeah, yeah)
Stand up for your right (Ohh-huuh)
Get up, stand up (Get up, stand up)
Don't give up the fight (Life is your right)
Get up, stand up(So we can't give up the fight)
Stand up for your right (Lord, Lord)
Get up, stand up (Keep on struggling on)
Don't give up the fight (Yeah)
[Verse 3: Peter Tosh]
We're sick and tired of your ism and schism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know and we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light
(What you gonna do?)
We going to stand up for our right
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)So you'd better...
[Outro: The Wailers]
Get up, stand up (Don't give it up)
Stand up for your right (Stand up right now)
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
(Don't give it up, don't give it up)
Get up, stand up (Get up, stand up)
Stand up for your right (Get up, stand up)
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
