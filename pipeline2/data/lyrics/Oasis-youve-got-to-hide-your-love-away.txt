[Verse 1]
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
[Chorus]
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
[Verse 2]
How could I even try
I can never win
Seeing them, hearing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
To gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
[Chorus]
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
