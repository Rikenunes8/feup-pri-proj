[Verse 1]
Aim for the body rare, you'll see it on TV
The worst thing in 1954 was the bikini
See the girl on the TV, dressed in a bikini
She doesn't think so, but she's dressed for the H-bomb (For the H-bomb)
[Refrain]
I found that essence rare
, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
[Verse 2]
Aim for the country fair, you read it in the paper
The worst thing happens any week, a scandal on the front page
See the happy pair smiling close, like they are monkeys
They wouldn't think so but they're holding themselves down (Hold themselves down)
[Refrain]
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
[Interlude]
[Refrain]
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
[Verse 3]
Aim for politician fair, who'll treat your vote, hope well
The last thing they'll ever do, act in your interest
Look at the world through your Polaroid glasses
Things'll look a whole lot better for the working classes (Working classes)
[Refrain]
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
[Interlude]
[Refrain]
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
