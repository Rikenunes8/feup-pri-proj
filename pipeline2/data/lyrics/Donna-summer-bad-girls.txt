Bad girls, talking ’bout the sad girls
Sad girls, talking ’bout bad, bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night (Walkin')
Picking up all kinds of strangers,
 
if the price is right
You can score if your pocket’s nice
But you want a good time

Like everybody else, they come from near and far
Woah, bad girls, yeah

Sad girls, (Sad girls) talking ’bout bad, bad girls, yeah

Friday night and the strip is hot (Hot)
Sun’s gone down and they’re about to trot (Out trottin')
Spirit’s high and they look hot
Do you wanna get down?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now, don’t you ask yourself, "Who they are?"
Like everybody else, they wanna be a star
Woah, yeah, yeah, there comes

Bad girl, sad girl, you’re such a naughty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh
You bad girl, you sad girl, you’re such a naughty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh[Verse 3]

But you call yourself by different names (Different names)
Now your Mama won’t like it when she finds out (Finds out)
Girl is out at night
