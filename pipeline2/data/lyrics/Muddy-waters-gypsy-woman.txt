[Chorus]
You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now
But that'll be trouble after while
[Verse 1]
Well, you know I went to a gypsy woman
To have my fortune told
Say, "You better go back home son
And peep through your, your key hole"
[Chorus]
You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now
But that'll be trouble after while
[Verse 2]
Well, now, you know I went back home
I took the gypsy woman as she said
I peeped through my key hole
There was another man laying in my bed[Chorus]
You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now
But that'll be trouble after while
