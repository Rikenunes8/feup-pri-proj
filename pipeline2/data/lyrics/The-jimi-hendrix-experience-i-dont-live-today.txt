[Intro]
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today
[Verse]
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me
So I can be on my miserable way
[Chorus]
I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh
I don't
Live today!
[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Waste your time away like this[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
Well, I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't tell you, baby; but, uh
I don't
Live today!
[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Spend the time away like this
Existing
[Interlude]
Yeah!
Ow!
Yeah!
Oh, no
[Instrumental]
[Interlude]
Oh, there ain't no life nowhere
Uh-huh, hmm[Outro]
Are you experienced?
Get experienced
Get experienced
Are you experienced?
