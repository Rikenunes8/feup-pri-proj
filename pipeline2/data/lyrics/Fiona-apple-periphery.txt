[Verse 1]
Oh, the periphery
They throw good parties there
Those peripheral idiots
Always have a bite to bear
Bear it, if you can
If you really want to
[Verse 2]
Go to the periphery
Have them 
celebrate your name
Have them forge you a pedigree and then you'll be
Left to run the races, lame
Run it if you want
If you think itâ€™s worth it
But not with me
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't appreciate
People who don't appreciate
All that loving must've been lackin' something
If I got bored tryin' to figure you out
You let me down
I don't even like you anymore at all
[Verse 3]
Oh, the periphery
I lost another one there
He found a prettier girl than me
With a more even-tempered air
And if he wants her, he should get her
'Cause I think he thinks she's worth it
And maybe they'll move from the periphery
Buy themselves their own plot of land
And I'll care in a different capacity, I'll just be
Hoping he makes a good family man
And if he finds himself yearning
For his throne on the silly side
There's nothing wrong, as long as he's learning
Besides, he can take it up with his bretheren
Or with his bride, just not with me
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't appreciate
People who don't appreciate
All that loving must've been lacking something
If I got bored tryin' to figure you out
You let me down
I don't even like you anymore at all
All that loving must've been lacking something
If I got bored tryin' to figure you out
You let me down
I don't even like you anymore at all[Outro]
Oh, the periphery
Oh, the periphery
Oh, the periphery
Oh, the periphery
Stole you away
Stole you away
Away, away
Stole you away, away
