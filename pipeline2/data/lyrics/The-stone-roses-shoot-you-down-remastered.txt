You know it, you show it, and the time has come
To shoot you down, what a sound
When the day is done and it all works out
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
You know it, you show it, and the time has come
To shoot you down, what a sound
When the day is done and it all works out
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
I never wanted the love that you showed me
It started to choke me and how I wish I'd said
No too slow, I couldn't take that too fast
I want you to know
You know it, you show it, but I can't back down
It's far too late, I can't wait
Now the time has come and it'll all work out
And when this thing is done, it'll leave no doubt
So when you had your fun, will you all walk out?
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
