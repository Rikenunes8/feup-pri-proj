One more Saturday night
One more grey shoot
One more happy to love
One more Saturday night
One more thinking you should
One more thinking you're right
One more thinking you love
One more thinking you're right
One more thinking you're bad
One more thinking you should
One more thinking you love
One more thinking you're fine
(Come by come by come by)
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Come by

Come by come by come by
Come by come by come by

One more thinking you lie
One more thinking you lie
One more suck at your life
One more suck at your life
One more suck at your life
One more suck at your life
(Ambiguous mumbles)
One more suck at your head
One more suck at your feet
One more suck at your eyes
One more suck at your shadow
When mother nature get high
One more Saturday night
And one more Saturday night
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday nightOne more enter your bone
One more enter your air
One more enter your hair
One more enter your low
One more enter your lie

One more thinking you low
One more thinking you high
One more thinking you down
