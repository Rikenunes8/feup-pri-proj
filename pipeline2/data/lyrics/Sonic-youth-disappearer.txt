[Verse 1]
Here it comes again, out of the rain
Seems to have a new kind of same
Been it playing on a simple rhyme
The site comes alive and speaks the mind
It turns to me and it turns to gold
It turns to see a fast lane slow
[Chorus 1]
It's been a way too long
It's been the way I gone
It's a-coasting on to the west star
[Verse 2]
Looking out, I thought I saw it blink
Coming on to me, like a silver eye
Pick it up and turn it on and
Head on out to a western star land
[Chorus 2]
It's been a man and gone
Now it's a singing song
Like a western star
It's going my way
[Verse 3]
Looking out I'm back in, time to stay
Into the eastern silent way
Comes alive, through and clearer
Ghost arise to dirty mirror
[Chorus 3]
You've been away too long
It's been way too long
An eastern star is on
A disappearer
