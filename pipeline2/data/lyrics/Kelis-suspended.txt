[Intro: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
Don't wake me, I'm still dreaming (
Wake up, wake up
)
I don't see you, I can't feel you (I can't feel you)
I'm alone for real in my mind (
Fall
)
I'll feel this all night, when my life takes flight (
Fall
)
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time
(
Wake up, wake up
)
[Verse 1: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
I feel like I'm falling, what happens when I hit?  (
Fall, fall
)
Must mean then that's it, this black abyss, this pit
It all seems shades of gray (
Wake up
)
I'm never ready for light of day (
Wake up
)
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time
This isn't just in your mind (
Wake up
)
We're suspended from space and time
[Verse 2: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
Why do you hurt me? This reality
Why do you smile at me? Show your fallacies (Fallacies)
Dreams hold me, never let me go (
No, wake up
)
When reality will wake me, I don't know  (
Wake up, wake up
)[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
This isn't just in your mind (
No, no, no
)
We're suspended from space and time
This isn't just in your mind (
No, no, wake up
)
We're suspended from space and time (
No
)
[Verse 3: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
Am I dreaming? If so, then why? (Am I dreaming? 
Wake up, no, wake up
)
My body's back on Earth, only spirits can fly (
No
)
Soaring through dimensions of love (
No, no
)
Kinds only my father speaks of (
No, wake up
)
Scenery changes, spins and roll (
Wake up
)
So does the color of our soul (
Wake up, wake up
)
I know how this must make you feel (
No
)
You hate me but believe me this is real (This was real)
This was real (
Wake up
)
[Outro: Pharrell]
Wake up, no, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
No, no, wake up, wake up, wake up
