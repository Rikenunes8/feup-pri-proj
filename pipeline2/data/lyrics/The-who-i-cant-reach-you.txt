I'm a billion ages past you
A million years behind you too
A thousand miles up in the air
A trillion times I've seen you there
Your hair is golden, mine is grey
You walk on grass, it turns to hay
Your blood is blue and your eyes are red
My body strains, but the nerves are dead
I can't reach you
I've strained my eyes
I can't reach you
I've split my sides
I can't reach trying to get on you
See, feel or hear from you
The distances grow greater now
You drink champagne and past me plow
You fly your plane right over my head
You're so alive and I'm nearly dead
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach trying to get on you
See, feel or hear from you
Once I caught a glimpse of your unguarded, untouched heart
Our fingertips touched and then my mind tore us apart
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach trying to get on you
See, feel or hear from you
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach trying to get on you
See, feel or hear from you
