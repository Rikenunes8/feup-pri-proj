I love the women, I love 'em all the same
I love the women, I love 'em all the same
But I don't love nobody well enough to change her name
Women make a fool out of me
Hey my papa scolded me, my mama, she sat and cried
Oh my papa scolded me, my mama, she sat and cried
I got too many women for any little boy my size
And women make a fool out of me
When I'm in the parlor, the girls think it's a treat
Yeah when I'm in the parlor, the girls think it's a treat
'Cause even in the wintertime, they turn off the heat
Hey, but women make a fool out of me
(Now flurry on me one time)
Yeah I love the women, Lord, I love 'em all the same
I love the women, I love 'em all the same
But I don't love nobody well enough to change her name
Women make a fool out of me
