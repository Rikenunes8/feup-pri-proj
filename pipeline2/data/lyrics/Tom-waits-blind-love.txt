Now you're gone
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck dames
And I don't care if they miss me
I never remember their names
They say if you get far enough away
You'll be on your way back home
Well I'm at the station
And I can't get on the train
It must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
With your blind love
Stone blind love
It's your stone blind love
Now the streets are turning blue
And the dogs are barking
And the night has come
And there's tears that are falling
From your blue eyes now
I wonder where you are
And I whisper your name
The only way to find you
Is if I close my eyes
I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh your blind love
Your stone blind love
It's your blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
It's your blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Stone blind love
