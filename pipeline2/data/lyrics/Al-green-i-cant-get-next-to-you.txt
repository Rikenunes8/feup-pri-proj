[Verse 1]
I ...(my my my my)
Oh, I can turn a gray sky blue
You see, I can make it rain when I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand, yeah
I, you see, can make a ship sail on dry land, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess, yeah
Girl, you're the key to my happiness and I...
[Chorus]
(Can't get next to you, babe)
Ooh Lord
(I can't get next to you)
I've been trying a long time
(Can't get next to you, babe)
(Can't get next to you)
I don't know what to do
(Let me say)
I .. (my my my my my)
Oh, I, oh Lord
[Verse 2]
I can fly like the bird in the sky
Oh, I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
Oh, I, and I can live forever if I so desire, yeah[Pre-Chorus]
Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess, yeah
Girl, you're the key 'cause I...
[Chorus]
(Can't get next to you, babe)
Baby baby
(Can't get next to you)
I've been trying a long time
(I can't get next to you, babe)
(I can't get next to you)
Oh, come on
[Verse 3]
(Let me tell you that)
I can turn back the hands of time
You better believe I can
Oh, I, you see, I can make the seasons change
Just by waving my hand, let me say
I, I can change anything from old to new, girl
Oh, I, yeah, and all the things I want to do the most
You see, I'm unable to do, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Unimportant are all these things
That I'm trying to do here today
Girl, you see, I...[Chorus]
(Can't get next to you, babe)
I've been trying a long time
(Can't get next to you)
Oh, somebody oughta help me
(Can't get next to you, babe)
Oh, let me, let me go
(I can't get next to you)
Let me!
I, Lord, I've been working on it, baby
I've been thinking about it
Oh, I, you see, I've been trying to call you all day long
But, you see, I don't have your phone number, honey
I, I've been, I've been thinking about you baby, something awful, you see, I
Oh, I, sometime I feel like I want to moan about it
And I just don't know what to say, and I say yeeeee...
