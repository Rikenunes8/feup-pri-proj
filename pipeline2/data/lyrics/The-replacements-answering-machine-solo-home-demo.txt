Try and breathe some life into a letter
Losing hope, we'll never be together
My courage is at its peak, you know what I mean
How do you say you're okay to an answering machine?
How do I say goodnight to an answering machine?
Big time's got its losers, small town vices and
A handful of friends, one needs a match and ice
Give [?] the time zone, nothing to see, but the tone
How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do say I love you to an answering machine?
Teach this whore all about romance
Try and free a slave of ignorance
How do I say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do you say I love you?
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
