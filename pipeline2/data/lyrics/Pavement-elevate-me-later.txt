[Verse 1]
Well, you greet the tokens and stamps
Underneath the fake oil-burnin' lamps
In the city we forgot to name
The concourse is four-wheeled shame
And the courthouse is double-breast
I'd like to check out your public protests
Why're you complaining? Ta!
[Verse 2]
Those who sleep with electric guitars
Range Rovin' with the cinema stars
And I wouldn't want to shake their hands
'Cause they're in such a high-protein land
Because there's 40 different shades of black
So many fortresses and ways to attack
So why're you complaining? Ta!
