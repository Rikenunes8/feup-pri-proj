[Verse 1]
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the colour of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you
[Bridge]
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tonnes of love inside?
I can't say
[Verse 2]
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
I-I-I-I-I
You wrap me up in
The colour of love
[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
Kiss of life
[Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 3]
Wasn't it clear
From the start?
Look the sky is full of love
Yeah the sky is full of love
[Bridge]
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tonnes of love inside?
I can't say[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life
[Saxophone Solo]
[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life (oh yeah)
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life
[Outro]
You wrapped me up in the colour of love
In the moonlight, baby
It must have been an angel came down from above
Giving me love, yeah
Giving me love, yeah
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
