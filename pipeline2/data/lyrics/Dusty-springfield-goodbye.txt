Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me
I should have known
When I looked into his eyes
He wasn't serious
I should have seen through his disguise
He led me to believe
That he would never leave
And I thought that I blew his mind
He said goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me
I sure get discouraged
When I think of what a fool I've been
I don't know where he's at
And I don't know where he's been
So how can he leave me?
Hurt and deceive me
When I make a mistake
This is all he had to kept on saying
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me, mmm
So how can he leave me?
Hurt and deceive me
When I make a mistake
This is all he had to kept on saying
Goodbye, ye, ye, ye
Is all he said to me
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Is all he said to me, yeah, ooh, ooh
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye
I said goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
