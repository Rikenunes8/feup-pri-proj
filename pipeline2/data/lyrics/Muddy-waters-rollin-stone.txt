[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in a oh, deep, blue sea
I would have all you good looking women
Fishing, fishing after me
Sure enough, a-after me
Sure enough, a-after me
Oh enough, oh enough, sure enough
[Verse 2]
I went to my baby's house
And I sit down oh, on her steps
She said, "Come on in now, Muddy
You know my husband just now left"
Sure enough, he just now left
Sure enough, he just now left
Oh enough, oh well, oh well
[Verse 3]
Well, my mother told my father
Just before hmmm, I was born
"I got a boy child's comin'
Gonna be, he's going to be a rolling stone"
Sure enough, he's a rolling stone
Sure enough, he's a rolling stone
Oh well he's a, oh well he's a, oh well he's a
[Instrumental]
[Verse 4]
Well, I feel, yes I feel
Feel that I could lay down oh, time isn't long
I'm gonna catch the first thing smoking
Back, back down the road, I'm going
Back down the road, I'm going
Back down the road, I'm going
Sure enough back, sure enough back
