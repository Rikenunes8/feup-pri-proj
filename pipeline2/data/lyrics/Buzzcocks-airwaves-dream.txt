[Verse 1]
This is to you, receiver
An important item, we say
Nobody will believe you
We make the facts today
There is no propaganda, there is no proper facts
We want to make new history, want to take you off the tracks
[Refrain]
It's coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves, dream
We're coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves, dream
[Verse 2]
This is to you, believer
We're inside your head today
There's nothing you will need now
We are your government, okay?
You're channeled here, stay off channel 14
When we say we're mean, we mean what we mean
[Refrain]
It's coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves, dream
We're coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves, dream
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
This is your country leader
Our intention is eloquent tricks
We are trained to see for you
To internalize your fix
We will only tell you what you want to hear
Have another pint, keep drinking the beer[Refrain]
It's coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves, dream
We're coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves
Coming on the airwaves, dream
