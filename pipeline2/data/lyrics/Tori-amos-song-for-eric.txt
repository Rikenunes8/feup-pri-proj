[Verse]
I wait all day for my sailor
And sometimes he comes
See you over hill and dale
Riding on the wind I see
You know me, you know me like the nightingale
"Oh, fair maiden, I see you standing there"
Will you hold me for just a fair time?
The tune is playing in the fair night
I see you in my dreams
Fair boy, your eyes haunt me
