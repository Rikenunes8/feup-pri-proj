To my surprise, one hundred stories high
People getting loose y'all
Getting down on the roof
Folks were screaming, out of control
It was so entertaining when
The boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
Satisfaction, you know it
Came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough
Till I had to self-destruct
The heat was on
It was rising to the top
Everybody going strong and
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
Up above my head
I hear music in the air
That lets me know
There's a party somewhere
Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, so
I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody going strong, and
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn the disco down
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
