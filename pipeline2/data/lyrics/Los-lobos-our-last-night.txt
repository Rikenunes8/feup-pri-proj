Now at last the night has fallen
We're all alone
The sky is dark, the stars are bright
And we're so far from home
You and I have been together
For so many years
If love is right, why do you fight
To hold back needless tears
Tell me babe, it'll be alright
But when I'm deep inside I realize
That this our last night
Bring your pretty head just closer
Get it close to mine
Your eyes are saying something
But the words are hard to find
Love don't know it lasts forever
Ours is here to stay
After all the love we've given
Please don't look at me that way
Tell me babe, it'll be alright
But when I'm deep inside I realize
That this our last night
Feelings come and hearts fall broken
Slipping through our hands
The ways of life and love
I'll never never understand
If it's true what you've been saying
If there's still a chance
Why is it that the two of us
Can't rescue this romance
Faded love don't ever come back
So the story goes
There is a side of you and I
Where love no longer goesTell me babe, it'll be alright
But when I'm deep inside I realize
That this our last night
