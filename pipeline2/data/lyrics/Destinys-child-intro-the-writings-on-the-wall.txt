[Kelly]
LeToya "Barzini", I wanna thank you
For helping me organize
This meeting here today
[LeToya]
And Kelly "Stracci", I also want to thank you
And all the other Dons of the four families
Beyoncé "Corleone", from the South West
And LaTavia "(Cle)menza", from the Four-Four
[LaTavia]
Our objective of this meeting today is to discuss
Destiny's Child's 'Commandments of Relationships'
[Kelly]
You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with broken hearts
[LaTavia]
Yes, Godfather
Times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days, you know?
[LeToya]
See, what we need
Is a man of his word
All this, uh, cheating, uh, backstabbing, uhm, hating
No more, no more
[LaTavia]
But, Godfather
How do we avoid all these mishaps?
[Beyoncé]
It's obvious
The Writing's On The Wall;
Thou shalt not hate
