[Refrain 1]
My first lover
My first lover
[Verse 1]
He was tall and breezy with his long hair down
But he gets a little hazy when I think of him now
[Refrain 1]
My first lover
My first lover
[Verse 2]
He was always talking tryin' to bring me down
But I was not waiting for a white wedding gown
[Refrain 1]
From my first lover
[Verse 3]
I do not remember any going wrong
Just a record playin' that old 
Steve Miller song
[Refrain 2]
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
[Verse 4]
At a surfer party with the whiskey pourin'
And the bottle rollin' I was on the floor
[Refrain 1]
With my first lover
My first lover
[Verse 5]
I do not remember any fights or fits
Just shaky morning after callin' it quits[Outro]
With my first lover
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
And she's free
