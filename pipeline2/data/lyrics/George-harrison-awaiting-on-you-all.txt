[Verse 1]
You don't need no love in
You don't need no bed pan
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope
To see the mess that you're in
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been polluted so long
Now here's a way for you to get clean
[Chorus]
By 
chanting
 the 
names
 of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
[Verse 2]
You don't need no passport
And you don't need no visas
You don't need to designate or to emigrate
Before you can see Jesus
If you open up your heart
You'll see He's right there
Always was and will be
He'll relieve you of your cares
[Chorus]
By 
chanting
 the 
names
 of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
[Verse 3]
You don't need no church house
And you don't need no Temple
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
To see that you have fallen
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been kept down so long
Someone's thinking that we're all green[Outro]
And while the Pope owns 51% of General Motors
And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us
But the Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
