Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door
I don't want no God on my lawn
Just a flower I can help along
'Cause the soul of nobody knows
How a flower grows
Oh, how a flower grows
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door
Mary dropped her pants by the sand
And let a parson come and take her hand
But the soul of nobody knows
Where the parson goes
Where does the parson go?
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door
