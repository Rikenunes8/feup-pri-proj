[Verse 1]
Back to where the memory lingers
Back to where the sun shines
Waves are breaking over my finger
Yes, it's been a long time
[Chorus]
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
[Verse 2]
Home is where the water is waiting
For the band that plays in the sunshine, oh yeah
Ooh
Yes, it's been a long time
[Chorus]
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
[Verse 3]
Back to where the living is easy
I can hear the song in the evening
Stones are shining into the water
Yes, it's been a long time
[Outro]
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
Sunshine sometime
Sometime sunshine
