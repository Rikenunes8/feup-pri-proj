The sound alone will make me move along
The thing speaks, you’re often here
I'm hiding alone, yeah, yeah
Now all this, it's slow now
They're hiding, they sure won't get there
And when you’re down, you’re down a wall, how?
The crazy town, all way down
If you lay slow, the warning hound
They're walking down and down, oh yeah
They're flaking down, they soothe my neck
They're walking round and down, way down
Just walking round and round, way down
Just walking round and down, way down
Won’t I leave?
It’s Monday, while I ride
Now tell her if her love's alive
Just gives no lie, just more life
Better ever tell about that
What time? Just more life
Just stay from here out of the blue day
A better life, it’s all I like
Just stay there, I'm walking back for a day
Yeah, they're back that you are so alive
See, they're back at you, I'm so alive
Forget one lie, it's a part of our life
We'll make it, you're back, it's just all your life
Working at night, I'm about to be too late
Forget it, end it all, sow back your life
This is all in one's life, just break it nigh
The magic’s better all alone
Just falling alone, the threshold of life
Living’s taking all of my morning life
Back, it’s all, it’s all going in my pocket
Yeah, the wall on fire, for all my morning life
All string
It’s all and now
Laying down to the ground
Is it the mind or is it the ground?
For the bold sense, it’s all...
Or is it a game
Or is it a game?He's just in, he just stopped
I couldn’t laugh
(Speaking in gibberish)
