[Verse 1]
Yankee soldier
He wanna shoot some skag
He met it in Cambodia
But now he can't afford a bag
Yankee dollar talk
To the dictator of the world
In fact it's giving orders
And they can't afford to miss a word
[Chorus]
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?
[Verse 2]
Yankee detectives
Are always on the TV
Because killers in America
Work seven days a week
Never mind the stars and stripes
Let's play the Watergate Tapes
I'll salute the New Wave
And I hope nobody escapes
[Chorus]
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?
[Chorus]
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?
[Chorus]
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?[Outro]
Move up Starsky
For the C.I.A
Suck on Kojak
For the U.S.A
