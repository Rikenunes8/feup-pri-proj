[Verse 1]
The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home
Tonight I've been walking in the rain
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame
[Pre-Chorus]
Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
[Chorus]
Just give me one more, one more chance
One more, one more chance
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
I will find out wherever you are
Drinking in another club or driving in your car
Walking through empty streets
Stupid fool, that was yours for keeps
[Pre-Chorus]
Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
[Chorus]
One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight
[Verse 3]
The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home
Tonight I've been walking in the rain
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame
[Pre-Chorus]
Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream[Chorus]
One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight
[Bridge]
You're so extreme
I want to take you home with me
Come on, tell me one more time, I don't mind
Baby, I don't mind, I don't mind
[Refrain]
Just give me one more...
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus]
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
[Chorus]
One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance[Outro]
Just give me one more
One more
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance to...
I don't mind
