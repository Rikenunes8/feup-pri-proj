I got a date with the night
Burning out my finger
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna walk on water
Buying out the fight
We're sweating in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight
[Hook]
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Don't tell me to fix her
Don't tell me to fix her
Just take a bite
No hanging no picture
Flying out my sight
Dropping brides at the altar
Both thighs squeeze tight
[Hook]
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
Buying out the fight
Gonna walk on water
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna bend my finger
Buying out my fight
We're sweating in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight
Both Thighs squeeze tight
