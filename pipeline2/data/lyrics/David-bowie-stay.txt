[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
