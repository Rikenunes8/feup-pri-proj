[Verse 1]
I got a reputation going round
Ain't never been the kind to back down
I’ve thrown a punch or two and gave a few black eyes
But Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
I hung in pretty good for a round or two
But he don’t fight fair like daddy taught me to
Her memory turned my head
And then he snuck up from behind
Yeah, Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
[Chorus]
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading breaks it right in two
Guess every superman has got his kryptonite
Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
[Verse 2]
Well I didn’t bleed and I ain't black and blue
But it ain't hard to tell who got the better of who
Cause in the morning light I’m hard to recognize
Yeah Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
[Chorus]
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading breaks it right in two
Guess every superman has got his kryptonite
Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
Come on grab the wind
[Outro]
That black label’s like black powder for my soul
My head feels like a bomb about to blow
But hell I’m half inclined to give that fuse a light
And let Jack Daniels kick my ass again tonight
It's got a new tonight
