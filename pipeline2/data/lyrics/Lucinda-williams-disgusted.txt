I been lookin' for my old man
I can't find him nowhere
I think I'll go to Chicago
And look around over there
If I can't find him
Go back on the river and sit right down
That man keep a-worryin' poor me
I'm gonna jump overboard and drown
My man, he come sit down
He come sit down right beside me
He said, "it would be good, Mama
If you just come with me"
And I go with my baby
What man like a woman with a sassy child?
I don't have to ask him no questions
Man, because he knows the reason why
I feel so disgusted
I don't know what to do
I think I'll go uptown
Try to find me somethin' new
Meet a man with a Cadillac
Whoa man, and plenty money too
I won't have to wake up early in the mornin'
'Cause I won't have nothin' in the world to do
