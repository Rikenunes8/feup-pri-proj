[Chorus]
Hit music on the radio
Hit music on the radio
[Verse 1]
When you dance with me we dance forever
All night long to your favourite
[Chorus]
Hit music on the radio
Hit music on the radio
[Verse 2]
When you dance with me we dance forever
All night long to the latest song
Live a lie, dance together
All night long to your favourite
[Chorus]
Hit music
Hit music
[Bridge]
I've been working hard all day
To pay the bills I have to pay
Don't have the strength to work all night
Or fight until it's almost light
[Chorus]
Music on the radio
D-dance music at the disco
[Verse 3]
Live a lie, dance together
All night long to your favourite song
Live and die, it's all that we know
I need a friend at the journey's end[Chorus]
Hit music in stereo
[Interlude]
[Verse 4]
It's all about love and it's about forgetting
Choose a song when the night's too long
We all need love and we want protection
I need a friend at the journey's end
In Kensington or Spanish Harlem
All night long to your desperate
[Chorus]
Hit music on the radio
Music at the disco
[Chorus]
Hit music on the radio
Hit music on the radio
