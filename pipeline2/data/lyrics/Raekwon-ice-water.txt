[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Tommy Hil' rockin' ice niggas
Tommy Hil' ice rockin' niggas who fuck—
Mira, aprende
Take a one on one to this shit, y'all (Yeah)
Get your nostrils clear (Yeah)
Come on, sniff your brains out 
all my Al Capone, Al Pacino niggas
 (Yeah, word up)
Who's down with drug smugglin' (Cappadonna, Golden Arms), yo, yo
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Check out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to half-moon Caesars and all the bitches in the bleachers
Hot weather, sex on the beaches
Jewelry shoppin' out of the country, deluxe luxury
People sayin' that my chains look truck on me
But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet?
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies kid, I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbin', ready for robbin'
But first, hit Maria's for a butter almond
The bionic microphone and smack mechanic
Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas
Son, it's on, so we can just max a million
I got the spot sewn so we can make a billion
The God's tropical, ladies call me black fruit punch
Rainbow flavor niggas murder niggas for lunch
Peace to the Paris Crew and the avenue, and my nigga Jay Love
Who carry switchblades on the reg, duke
[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef
I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep
Into my realm of sunshine, I praise divine
Fine line between Donna, dumb, deaf and blind
He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots in daytime
Crossed over grain while we was bubblin' moonshine
Sippin' on a Moët, laid up, Rae-Gambino
Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino
Developed while your head be swellin' up off of the Nation
Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation
Donna holy fat bags of weed, ravioli pasta
Bodyguard the Killa Bee songs like Kevin Costner
Infrared all inside your bumbo, rasta
Cappadonna pimp the derby like the mobster
[Interlude: Big Un & 
Raekwon
]
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, spaghetti lame brain-ass niggas
Quarters, nickels, and dimes, bitch, 'cept for overtime, nigga
Any ass money suit me fine
'Cause I'm coming strong, breaking niggas backs, keepin' shit real
If you haven't noticed, bitchy-ass, rusty-ass nigga
Let me tell you this one time
Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef
Cappachino and Golden Arms is coming through mad strong
From the isles of Shaolin
For all them faggot-ass, rusty, chickenhead bitches, too
Shup Shup baby? (
Yo
)[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Back in the days, baggin' crack, scrapin' plates
Flippin' cakes
 who them heavy head niggas hatin' Jakes?
It be us, wall to wall soldiers, hangin' in halls gettin' over
City niggas shoot for blood money, rockin' Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket in the streets
Why these people mob money in they Jeep?
Crack bums watch your back for jums
Cost me for a fake twenty dollar bill, get 'em son, we ain't the one
Politickin', plus vickin', sick of these Dominicans
Eatin' good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigan's
That's life, to top it all off, 
beef with White
Pullin' bleach out, tryin' to throw it in my eyesight
Yo, fuck is on your mind?
