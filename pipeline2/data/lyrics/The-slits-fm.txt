(FM, FM)
I live in a town with a hundred lights around
My head is like a radio set
I'm waiting to hear what program is next
What program is next? (FM)
Frequent Mutilation transmits over the air
Serving for the purpose
Of those who want you to fear
They say it's all right, but suspicion creeps in
My nightmares don't project my dreams
I can't but wonder what's feeding my screen
What's feeding my screen? (FM)
Frequent Mutilation transmits over the air
Serving for the purpose
Of those who want you to fear
Thousand nights of confusion wedged in my mind
Breaking down another illusion
Today's transmission will give me the solution
Frequent Mutilation transmits over the air
Serving for the purpose
Of those who want you to fear
