[Verse]
That's all right, that's all right, that's all right
Sometimes you feel like trouble, sometimes you feel down
Let this music relax your mind, let the music relax your mind
Stand up and be counted, can't get a witness
Sometimes you need somebody, if you have somebody to love
Sometimes you ain’t got nobody and you want somebody to love
Then you don't want to walk and talk about Jesus
You just want to see His face
You don't want to walk and talk about Jesus
You just want to see His face
