If I could, I surely would
Give my life to you
So you can have two
Take me in your arms and lie to me
You tell me it's always going
To be like this
The world is the coldest place
Surely the coldest place
There's a storm inside my house
Raging and relentless
Wind tearing at the rafters
Howling through the timbers
Hard stinging rain
Falling in and falling down
Hope this storm doesn't rip my roof off
My skin keeps the storm inside
