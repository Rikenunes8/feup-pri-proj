[Verse 1]
I need a camera to my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong
[Pre-Chorus]
I've counted out
The days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With echoes in my heart
[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay
[Verse 2]
I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eye, deciding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Where memories distort
[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay
[Pre-Chorus]
I've counted out
And no one knows how far
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
With echoes in my heart
(Tell 'em I'm lost)[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
Yeah, I'm lost
And no, it's not okay
[Outro]
No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay
