[Chorus 1]
Wey, hey, hey, mmm baby hang on
Wey, hey, hey, mmm baby hang on
Hang to your heartbeat, tight as a drum
Hang on to your love, see it shines like a song
Wey, hey, hey, mmm baby hang on
Our love shines like rain
In those spanish eyes
[Chorus 2]
Wey, hey, hey, here she comes
Comes in colours, now she's gonna turn the daylight on
Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I love the way you walk on me
And I need you more than you need me (yeah)
Our love shines like rain in those spanish eyes
[Bridge]
I'll cross the world for green and gold
But, it's those spanish eyes that get me home
Home again
[Verse]
Wey, hey, hey, sugar hang on
Wey, hey, hey, you know that the night is as young
I'm dazzled by a light that shines in your eyes
I'm used to standing in the shadows and waiting for the night
Forever in fever, forever in heat
You re-invented me, now don't put me back on the street
[Outro]
Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I mean the things you mean to me
And I need you
