[Verse 1]
Here she comes
Lady luck again
Figure of eight
Six and nine again
I… I…
I… I…
My lady with the spinning head
Whatever the deal (Whatever the deal)
She won’t let me down
Wherever I go (Wherever I go)
She’s always hangin’ round
I… I…
I… I…
Got my lady with the spinning head
[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la
Lady with the spinning head
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la
Lady with the spinning head
(Oh yeah, come on baby)
[Verse 2]
She’s been gone
But I knew she’d be back
She’s got the red
She put me in the black
I… I…
I… I…
Need the lady with the spinning head[Bridge]
Mean old man
Took away my car
No credit cards?
What’re ya talkin’ about?
I’m on top
When she’s around
She’s my ticket
Out of town
[Chorus]
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la
Lady with the spinning head
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la
Lady with the spinning head
