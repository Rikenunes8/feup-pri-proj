Did you get it
Did you need it
Did you really
What you wanted
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have the fun
Did you crack it
Did you grab it
Did you reel it
Like a rabbit
Did you rock
Did you roll
Did you move yourself along
And how could you do
And did you see me sing this song
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong
Did you grab it
Did you want it
Is it really what you wanted
Did you run in the sun
Did you imitate a walk
Did you answer
Did you grab it
Did you gun it like a rabbit
Did you walk
Did you run
Can you feel you rising up
And how can you do
And when you sang it in the song
And it sank, and it threw
Where did it all go wrong
Did you drown it
Did you roll it
Did you smash it
Did you warm it
Did you clean it
Clean it up
Did you rub it
Did you soapDid you screen it
Did you ream it
Did you ruin it
Did you feed it
Is it warm in the sun
When the weather's getting warm
And the worlds at your feet
And it is our time to say
It's all gone wrong
Where did it all go wrong
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
You take me, baby, in circles, dancing
Darling, darling, darling...I want you
Why oh, why oh, why oh...stony rose
You lose your guy
You walk on by
You walk on by
You walk on by
You walk on by
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
