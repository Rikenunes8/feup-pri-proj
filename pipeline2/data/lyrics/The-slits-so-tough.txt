He had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
So tough
You can't take anymore now you're getting weak
So tough
Don't start playing hide and seek
So hard
Why do you think he got like that?
So hard
Don't think about it much 'cause it's just a rut
You had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
So strong
They say you're acting like a star
So strong
They say not everything's wonderbar
Too long
You want money, girls urgently
Too long
Too much, too soon you wait and see
Too much
You hang around her 'cause she's a good mate
Too much
Milkshakes and cherry cheesecake
Too fast
They want to stop you having kicks
Slow down
Don't fuck things up by getting sick againYou had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
So tough
You can't take anymore now you're getting weak
So tough
Don't start playing hide and seek
So hard
Why do you think he got like that?
So hard
Don't think about it much 'cause it's just a rut
You had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
