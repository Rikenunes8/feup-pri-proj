[Verse 1]
Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aw, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
[Chorus]
Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Verse 2]
You might-a heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aw, but that never hurt no one
[Pre-Chorus]
So come on Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
[Chorus]
Darling, only the good die young
Oh oh oh oh ohh
I tell ya 
only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Verse 3]
You got a nice white dress
And a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold[Verse 4]
But Virginia
They didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
[Pre-Chorus]
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
[Chorus]
You know that only the good die young
Oh oh ohh baby
I tell ya only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Instrumental Break]
2:26 - 2:39
[Bridge]
You said your mother told you
"All that I could give you was a reputation"
Aw, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh oh oh[Pre-Chorus]
Come out, come out, come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
[Chorus]
You know that only the good die young
Tell you baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Outro]
Only the good
Only the good die young
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
