[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
I know perfectly well I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware you've been patient with me
Every time we break up, you bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you, how can it be
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson
]
You 
still believe in me
[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I try hard to be more what you want me to be
But I can't help how I act when you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong, but sometimes, I fail myself
And after all I've promised you so faithfully
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson
]
You 
still believe in me
[Outro: Brian Wilson]
I wanna cry
Cry
Ah
Ah
Ah
