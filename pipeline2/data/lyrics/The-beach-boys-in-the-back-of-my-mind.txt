[Verse 1: Dennis Wilson]
I'm blessed with everything
A world to which a man can cling
So happy times when I break out in tears
In the back of my mind I still have my fears
[Verse 2: Dennis Wilson]
I live my life with her
Love her true, she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm afraid it's going to change
[Bridge: Dennis Wilson]
I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just gonna be the way they'll be
[Verse 3: Dennis Wilson]
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I lose her
It will always be way in the back of my mind
