This is a mercy mission
From a faceless messenger
Who don't wanna see you hit
Here's the word
Listen to it
Somebody that you used to know
Is back in town, you better go
This is a mercy mission
A voice you'll never hear again
From a southside call box
Winged demons are the hardest to outfox
The same one you lost on the run
Gonna show you that it ain't no fun
You better get out of town
'Cause you're gonna get hit
I didn't wanna see you fail
This is a mercy mission
You'll find your schedule underneath the door
All of the arrangements have been made
Major expenses have been paid as you knowDon't forget the last details
