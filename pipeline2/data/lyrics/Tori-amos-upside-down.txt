[Verse 1]
God, I love to turn my little blue world upside down
God, I love to turn my little blue world upside down
Inside my head the noise, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter
You see I'm afraid I'll always be still coming out of my mother upside down
[Verse 2]
Don't you love to turn this little blue girl upside down
Oh, I know you love to turn this little blue girl, baby, upside down
But my heart it says you've been shatter, shatter, shatter, shatter, shattered
And I know you're still a boy, still coming out of your mother
[Bridge 1]
But when you going to stand on your own?
I say the world is sick
You say, "Tell me what that makes us, darling?"
You see you always find my faults
Faster than you find your own
You say the world is getting rid of her demons
I say, "Baby, what have you been smoking?"
Well, I dreamed, I dreamed, I dreamed I loved a black boy
My daddy would scream
[Verse 3]
Don't you love to turn this little blue girl upside down?
Any kind of touch I think is better than none, even upside down
But you see I'm tangled up, got a kitten, kitten, kitten, kitten in my hair
Cincinnati, I like the word, it's the only thing we can't seem to turn upside down
[Interlude]
[Bridge 2]
Well, I found the secret to life
I found the secret to life
I'm okay when everything is not okay
I said I found the secret to life
I found the secret to life
I'm okay when everything is not okay, is not okay[Verse 4]
Don't we love to turn our little blue world upside down?
I said don't we love to turn our little blue world baby upside down?
Inside my head a voice, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter
And it says, "Girl, you're all the same, still coming out of your mothers
Still coming out of your mothers upside down"
