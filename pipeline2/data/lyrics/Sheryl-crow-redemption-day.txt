[Verse 1]
I've wept for those who suffer long
But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killin'
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh, what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing
[Chorus]
There is a train that's headed straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day
[Verse 2]
Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television
Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening
[Verse 3]
What do you have for us today?
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited 'til so late
Was there no oil to excavate?
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great[Chorus]
There is a train that's headed straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day
[Outro]
It's buried in the countryside
Exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
