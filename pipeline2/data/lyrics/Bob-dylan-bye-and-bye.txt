[Verse 1]
Bye and bye, I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
While I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you I'm casting my eye
[Verse 2]
I'm paintin' the town, swinging my partner around
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go-round
[Chorus]
Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin' and I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires
[Verse 3]
I'm rollin' slow
I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow
Goin' where the wild roses grow
[Chorus]
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last
[Verse 4]
Papa gone mad
Mamma, she's feeling sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be
