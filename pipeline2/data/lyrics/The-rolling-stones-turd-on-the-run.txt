[Verse 1]
Grabbed hold of your coat tail but it come off in my hand
I reached for your lapel but it weren't sewn on so grand
Begged, promised anything if only you would stay
Well, I lost a lot of love over you
Yeah, that's right
[Verse 2]
Fell down to my knees and I hung onto your pants
But you just kept on running while they ripped off in my hands
Diamond rings, Vaseline, you give me disease
Well, I lost a lot of love over you
[Break]
Aw, aw baby, alright, woo
[Verse 3]
I boogied in the ballroom, I boogied in the dark
Tie your hands, tie you feet, throw you to the sharks
Make you sweat, make you scream, make you wish you'd never been
I lost a lot of love over you
