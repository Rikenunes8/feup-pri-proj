[Verse 1]
I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me
[Pre-Chorus]
You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special
Made it dangerous
So I bury it
And forget
[Chorus]
But every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen
[Verse 2]
On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small
In their big black car
To be a threat to the men in power
[Pre-Chorus]
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden
I can't hide you
From the government
Oh, God, Daddy
I won't forget
[Chorus 2]
'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen[Interlude]
[Chorus]
And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, oh
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
"We're cloudbusting, daddy"
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
[Outro]
The sun's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Your son's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
