[Verse 1]
Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start
[Chorus]
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
[Verse 2]
Every time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that I'm living for
[Chorus]
I want you, I need you, I love you
More and more
[Bridge]
I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that I will go on
Loving you eternally
[Verse 4]
Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die every time we're apart
[Chorus]
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
[Bridge]
Well, I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that I will go
On loving you eternally
[Verse 4]
Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die every time we're apart[Chorus]
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
