[Verse 1]
If you've got leavin' on your mind
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If you've got leavin' on your mind
[Verse 2]
If there's a new love in your heart
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart
[Bridge]
Don't leave me here in a world
Filled with dreams that might have been
Hurt me now, get it over
I may learn to love again
[Verse 2]
If there's a new love in your heart
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart
