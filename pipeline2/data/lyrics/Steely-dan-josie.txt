[Verse 1]
We're gonna break out the hats and hooters
When Josie comes home
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters
When Josie comes home to stay
We're gonna park in the street
Sleep on the beach and make it
Throw down the jam 'til the girls say when
Lay down the law and break it
When Josie comes home
[Chorus]
When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
[Verse 2]
Jo would you love to scrapple
She'll never say no, no!
Shine up the battle apple
We'll shake 'em all down tonight
We're gonna mix in the street
Strike at the stroke of midnight
Dance on the bones
 'til the girls say when
Pick up what's left by daylight
When Josie comes home
[Chorus]
When Josie comes home
So bad
She's the best friend we never had
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
[Instrumental Outro]
