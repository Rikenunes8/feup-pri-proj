[Chorus]
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
[Verse 1]
J'ai les glandes
 with your theatrics, your acting's a drag
It's okay on TV 'cause you can turn it off, but don't try me
Yes, your marriage is a tragedy, but it's not my concern
I'm very superficial, I hate anything official
[Chorus]
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me)
[Verse 2]
Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death
You've made a desperate appeal, now save your breath
Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret
Shit that's so wet
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations
[Chorus]
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me)
Oh[Verse 3]
You asked me for advice, I said, "Use the door"
But you're still clinging to somebody you deplore
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry
[Chorus]
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life, private life, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me)
Oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life, private life, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me, stop)
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
(You've been lying to someone and now me)[Outro]
Oh
Oh
How you mean
