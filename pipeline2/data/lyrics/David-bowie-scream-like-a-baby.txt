[Verse 1]
Well, I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam
'Cause he was like me
[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
[Verse 2]
Well, they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains
 and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And, oh, I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of societ... societ... s...
[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun[Bridge]
No athletic program
No discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat
Swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved
[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
[Outro]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
