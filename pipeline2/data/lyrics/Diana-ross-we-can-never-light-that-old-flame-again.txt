[INTRO]
Never light that old flame again
No, not ever, no never
We just can't fight it
We just can't light it
[VERSE 1]
When our friendship turned to love
That's when the world turned on
But when our love turned to friendship
I knew the feelin' was gone
Why keep clingin' to bits and pieces
When all the time loneliness increases
We both have to know when to let go
[BRIDGE 1]
But we talk and talk and lay awake
The more we talk, the less we say
There's no way, just ain't no way
[Chorus]
We can ever light that old flame again
Never feel the same again
With warmed over love and leftover dreams
[VERSE 2]
When our love was a ragin' fire
We'd make love all night
But now when we're makin' love
We make love just to be polite
We can't go back to where we've been
Can never cross that bridge again
But let's be glad for what we had
[BRIDGE 2]
'Cause we took and took until it's all used up
We can't drink from an empty cup
It's all used up, it's all used up
[Chorus][BRIDGE 2]
[Chorus]
[VERSE 3]
Life's too short to keep holdin' on
We both know that the feeling's gone
We keep clingin' to bits and pieces
When all the time loneliness increases
[AD LIB TO Chorus TO FADE]
Ain't no way
Ain't no way, baby
Oh, there just ain't no way
No, there just ain't no way
That we could ever light that old flame again
Never feel ever the same again
With warmed over love and leftover dreams
