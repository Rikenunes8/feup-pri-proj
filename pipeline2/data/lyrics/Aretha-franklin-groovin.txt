[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon (Sunday, Sunday)
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon (Too soon)
[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There is ain't place I'd like to be instead of
[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a crowded avenue
Groovin'
Anything we like to do
[Verse 2]
There's always lots of things that we could see
We could be anyone we wanna be
And all those happy people, we could meet just
[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin', baby
I couldn't get away too soon (Too soon)
[Verse 3]
(If we can) We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
(Hold my hand) We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstacy, you and me, we'll just be
[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Ah, groovin'
I couldn't get away too soon, baby[Outro]
'Cause darling, you send me
Groovin' (Just groovin', just groovin')
