[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here, so fine"
[Verse 2]
Just then, the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand
[Verse 3]
Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground
[Verse 4]
See here, how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up
And then the
Sun, it going down
Shine through my window and
My friends, they come around
[Bridge]
Come around
Come around[Verse 5]
The people may know but
The people don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now, let's go
Run and see
Run and see
Run and see
Run, run, and see
Hey, hey
See
