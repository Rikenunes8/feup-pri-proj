I drag myself up the corridor
I have my knees on the tile floor
I rest my head on the porcelain
Cannot remember what I've just seen
I drag myself up the corridor
I have my knees on the tile floor
I rest my head on the porcelain
The cool, cool porcelain
Cannot remember what I've just seen
Cannot remember what I've just said
Cannot remember where he's just been
I guess it's time to unpack the suitcase
Then I go no place
Just my head spinning round, round, round, round
Just my head spinning round, round, round, round
(Round, round, round, round, round)
Round, round, round, round, round
(Round, round, round, round)
Round, round, round, round, round
My private order's come in
