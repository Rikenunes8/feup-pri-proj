[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Now there you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Nicks]
A heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
What you lost
[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sеll?
Dreams of loneliness
[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Nicks]
A hеartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost
[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
You know, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Well, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
You'll know[Spoken: Stevie Nicks]
You will know! Thank you!
