[Verse 1]
Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
[Bridge]
Any day now
(Any day now)
I'll be all alone
(I'll be all alone)
[Verse 2]
Any day now, when your restless eyes
Meet someone new, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
[Bridge]
Any day now
(Any day now)
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
[Verse 3]
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay, yeah
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
[Verse 4]
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off, then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
[Bridge]
Any day now
(Any day now, any day now)
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
And you won't be around
(Any day now)[Outro]
Any day now, any day now
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
(Any day now)
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
(Any day now)
Any day now, don't fly away
