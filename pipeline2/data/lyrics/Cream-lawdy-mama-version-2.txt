Wanna go out, baby, to late at night
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Wanna go out, baby, to late at night
I got a real funny feeling
You're gonna treat your daddy right
Big-legged woman, come and hold my hand
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Big-legged woman, come and hold my hand
I got a real funny feeling
You wanna love another man
