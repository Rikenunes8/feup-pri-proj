[Verse 1]
The cash machine is blue and green
For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee
I could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents
On Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes
I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck
How hot and sorrowful, this machine begs for luck
[Refrain]
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new
[Verse 2]
I want a good life with a nose for things
Fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering
A hole without a key if I break my tongue
Speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come?
[Refrain]
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new
[Bridge]
I'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache 
when I hear myself sing
[Refrain]
All my lies are only wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new
[Outro]
I would like to salute
The ashes of American flags
And all the fallen leaves
Filling up shopping bags
