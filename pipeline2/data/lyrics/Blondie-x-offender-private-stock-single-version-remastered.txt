[Intro]
I saw you standing on the corner
You looked so big and fine
I really wanted to go out with you
So when you smiled
I laid my heart on the line
[Verse 1]
You read me my rights
And then you said
"Let's go" and nothing more
I thought of my nights
And how they were
They were filled with
[Chorus]
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst, then
You'd step in
I had to know
So I asked
You just had to laugh
[Verse 2]
We sat in the night
With my hands cuffed at my side
I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more
[Chorus]
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst
Then you'd step in
I had to know
So I asked
You just had to laugh
[Bridge]
Walking the line
You werе a marksman
Told me that law
Like wine, is agеless
Public defender
You had to admit
You wanted the love of a sex offender[Chorus]
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst then
You'd step in
I had to know
So I asked
You just had to laugh
[Verse 3]
My vision in blue
I call you from
Inside my cell
And in the trial
You were there
With your badge
And rubber boots
[Outro]
I think all the time
How I'm going to
Perpetrate love with you
And when I get out
There's no doubt
I'll be sex offensive to you
Ooh-oooh
Ooh-whooh-ooh-ooh
