Look here!
What ya' think you're gonna be doin' next year?
No lie
How you know you're not gonna up and die?
No doubt
Soon enough your friends will find you out
Take care
You might not have much time to spare
(x2)
I say, how long have you been actin' up this way?
One knows
When you gonna get your own floor show
I'm hip
And you could use a 
button on your lip
Look here
What ya' think you're gonna be doin' next year?
Yeah
