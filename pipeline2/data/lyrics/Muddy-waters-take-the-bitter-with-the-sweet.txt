You, heard somebody sayin'
That I loved another (ooh ooh ooh)
They don't know, it's not easy fakin'
Lies about your lover (ooh ooh ooh)
Nothing they could tell you
Would change the way it feels
But when they, try to come between us
We still have each other (ooh ooh ooh)
I've heard it all, and I have my faults
But I could never hurt you, I love you through it all
Take the bitter with the sweet
Two hearts are stronger together
Love can be forever
Take the bitter with the sweet
We can't let rumors affect us
We just, have to trust
I, want you more than ever
No matter what they told you (ooh ooh ooh)
If they pry, doesn't really matter
Long as I can hold you (ooh ooh ooh)
People can say what they want to say
But you know that I love you, it's better every day
Take the bitter with the sweet
Two hearts are stronger together
Love can be forever
Take the bitter with the sweet
We can't let rumors affect us
We just, have to trust
