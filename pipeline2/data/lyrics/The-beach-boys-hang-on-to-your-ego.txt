[Verse 1: The Beach Boys]
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive
[Chorus 1: The Beach Boys]
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
[Verse 2: The Beach Boys]
They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night
[Chorus 2: The Beach Boys]
Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty
[Chorus 1: The Beach Boys]
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
[Chorus 2: The Beach Boys]
Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty[Chorus 1: The Beach Boys]
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
[Outro: Brian Wilson's dog, Marylin Wilson, Brian Wilson & Chuck Britz]
(Bark)
Hey Chuck is it possible we could bring a horse in here without, if we
Don't screw anything up
I beg your pardon
Honest to God, now, the horse is tamed and everything
