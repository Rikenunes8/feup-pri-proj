[Verse 1]
She broke down, let me in
Made me see where I'd been
[Chorus]
I’ve been down one time
I’ve been down two time
I'm never going back again
Mhm
(Ooh, yeah)
(Mmm)
[Verse 2]
(Mmm) You don't know what it means to win, oh no
Come down to see me ‘gain, mhm, yeah
[Chorus]
I’ve been down one time
I’ve been down two time
Oh yeah, I'm never going back again
Hm-hmm
(Yeah)
[Outro]
Thank you very much!
