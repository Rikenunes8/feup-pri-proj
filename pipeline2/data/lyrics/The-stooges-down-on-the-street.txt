[Verse 1]
Well, down on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around, 
on a real O-Mind
I see a pretty thing - ain't no wall
I see a pretty thing - ain't no wall
[Chorus 1]
No walls!
No walls!
No walls!
[Verse 2]
Yeah, deep in the night, I'm lost in love
Yeah, deep in the night, I'm lost in love
A thousand eyes
Look at you
A thousand lights
Look at you
[Chorus 2]
I don't!
I'm lost!
I'm lost!
Yeah!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
[Guitar Solo]
*Grunt*
Come on, come on!
Yeah!
Yeah!
[Breakdown]
*Grunt*
Oooh, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on[Outro]
Where the faces shine
A real O-Mind
A real O-Mind
I'm a real O-Mind
A real O-Mind
