[Verse 1]
High up above the crowd
The great Valerio is walking
The rope seems hung from cloud to cloud
And time stands still while he is walking
His eye is steady on the target
His foot is sure upon the rope
Alone and peaceful as a mountain
And certain as the mountain slope
[Verse 2]
We falter at the sight
We who stumble in the mire
Fools who think they see the light
Prepare to balance on the wire
But we learn to watch together
And feed on what we see above
Till our hearts turn like the seasons
And we are acrobats of love
[Chorus]
How we wonder, how we wonder
Watching far below
We would all be that great hero
The great Valerio
[Verse 3]
Come all you [?] and tumblers
Are you really ready yet?
No unseen hand will pluck you
As you tumble to the net
So come with me to see Valerio
As he dances through the air
I'm your friend until you use me
And then be sure I won't be there
[Chorus]
How we wonder, how we wonder
Watching far below
We would all be that great hero
The great Valerio
