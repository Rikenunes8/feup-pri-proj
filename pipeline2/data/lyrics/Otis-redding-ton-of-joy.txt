My baby nothing but a ton of joy
Children, yes she is one ton of joy
My baby nothing but a ton of joy
Love, love, love, love, love, lovely
Lovely ton of joy
The way she love me makes me know I'm a man
What she do for me you don't understand, children
Baby, you're a ton of joy
Lovely, lovely, lovely ton of joy
She's got what all men are trying to find
Drives a strong man practically out of his mind, children
She gives the blind man eyes to see, y'all
She knocks a preacher man straight on his knees, y'all
Baby, baby, you're a ton of joy
Girl, I love, I love your ton of joy
Children, the way she loves me makes me wanna learn
You sets me on fire, but I'm willing to burn, children, ooh
Baby, you're a ton of joy
A lovely, lovely, lovely ton of joy
Children, the way she loves me makes me wanna learn
You sets me on fire, but I'm willing to burn, children, ooh
Girl, you just a ton of joy
A lovely, lovely, lovely ton of joy, gotcha
You love girl, I love you, baby
No matter what you do, girl
I'm gonna keep loving you
No matter what you say
You got one hundred tons of -
One hundred ton of joy, baby
You don't weigh but a hundred
But I just love you
Don't weigh but a hundred
I love the way you look, now
