[Verse 1]
Though you sit in another chair, I can feel you here
Looking like I don't care, but I do— I do
Hiding it all behind anything I see
Should someone be looking at me
[Verse 2]
While I occupy my mind, I can feel you here
Love to us is so well timed
And I do— I do
Wasting away these moments so heavenly
Should someone be looking at me
[Chorus]
Let it down, let it down
Let your hair hang all around me
Let it down, let it all down
Let your love flow and astound me
[Verse 3]
While you look so sweetly and divine, I can feel you here
I see your eyes are busy kissing mine
And I do— I do
Wondering what it is they are expecting to see
Should someone be looking at me
[Chorus]
Let it down, let it down
Let your hair hang all around me
Let it down, let it all down
Let your love flow and astound me
[Outro]
Let it down, let it down, ooh
Let it down, let it down, ooh
Let it down, let it down, ooh
