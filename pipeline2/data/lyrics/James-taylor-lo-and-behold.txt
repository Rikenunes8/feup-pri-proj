[Verse 1]
Lonely by day, empty and cold
Only to say lo and behold
Deep in the night, down in my dreams
Glorious sight this soul has seen
[Chorus]
There's a well on the hill
You just can't kill for Jesus
There's a well on the hill
Let it be
Don't build no heathen temples
Where the Lord has done laid his hand now
There's a well on the hill
Let it be
[Verse 2]
Everyone's talking 'bout the gospel story
Some shall sink and some shall rise
Everyone's talking 'bout the train to glory
Long, long time till it gets here to you, baby
[Chorus]
There's a well on the hill
You just can't kill for Jesus
There's a well on the hill
Let it be
Now don't build no heathen temples
Where the Lord has done laid a hand
There's a well on the hill
Let it be
