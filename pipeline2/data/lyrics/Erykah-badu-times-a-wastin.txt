[Intro]
Yeah, ay
[Chorus]
Time's a wastin'
Don't you take your time, young man
Keep on drifting and
Ain't no telling where you'll land
[Verse 1]
Run baby, run, run
Where you running to?
And who you running from?
Some people may not understand
What it means to be a man
Taking full command
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're living in a world that's oh-so-strange
Boy, don't let your focus change
Taking out the demons in your range
Living in a world that's oh-so-fast
Gotta make your money last
Learn from your past, oh
[Chorus]
Time's a wastin'
Don't you take your time, young man
Keep on drifting
Ain't no telling where you'll land
[Verse 2]
Sweet love and sunshine
If it's all in the air
Then it's all on your mind
Breathe baby
Come back to the world
Dig up all your pearls
Teach the boys and girls
[Pre-Chorus]
We're Living in a world that's oh-so-strange
Boy, don't let your focus change
Taking out the demons in your range
Living in a world that's oh-so-fast
Gotta make your money last
Learn from your past[Segue]
Oh baby we need to smile
Oh baby we need to smile
Oh baby we need to smile
Oh baby we need to smile
Oh baby, baby we need to smile
[Chorus]
Cause time's a wastin'
Don't you take your time, young man
Keep on drifting and
Ain't no telling where you'll land
[Segue]
Oh baby we need to smile
Oh baby we need to smile
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Outro]
Time's a wastin'
Don't you take your time, young man
Keep on drifting
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
Ain't no telling where you'll land
