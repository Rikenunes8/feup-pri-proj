[Verse 1]
Early Monday morning to Friday at five
Man, I work work work but I don't climb climb climb
Boss man can shove that over time up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand
[Chorus 1]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a forty hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Verse 2]
Yeah, the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I take my jacked up drop er down in 4x4
She'll down a long neck, warm up the band
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Chorus 2]
To fill it up or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
Five, four, three, two, one, I'll be your rocket man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Verse 3]
You make me want to go ooh ooh when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playing peaky boo on your back
If you want to impress me, baby, here's my plan
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Chorus 3]
To fill it up or throw it down
When you drive me home take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane I'll be your Superman
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Verse 4]
My head Monday morning as that alarm clock sings
It goes bang bang bang while it ring ring rings
Yeah I'm ready to roll if you wanna rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Damn right I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Chorus 4]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a little hangover still hanging around
Yeah that hair of a dog is saying hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
[Outro]
Yeah, that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Ooh yeah
