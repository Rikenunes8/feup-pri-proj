[Verse 1]
She couldn't stand me anymore
So she just took the kids and went
You see, I've got a drinkin' problem
All the money that we had I spent
[Chorus]
Now I must die by my own hand
'Cause I'm not man enough to live alone
Hey, hey, she's better off without me
And I'm better off dead now that she's gone
[Verse 2]
Ahh, She gave the most, took the least
And she even had the priest come to our home
And I cried and prayed and promised
That I'd leave the stuff alone
[Chorus]
Now I must leave what I can't face
I hope she finds the kids a happy home
Hey, hey, she's better off without me
And I'm better off dead now that she's gone
[Verse 3]
She used to call her friend and cry
Then the man cut off the telephone
She'd sit and cry while I went out
And pawned the things we owned[Chorus]
Now I must die by my own hand
'Cause I'm not man enough to live alone
Hey, hey, she's better off without me
And I'm better off dead...
