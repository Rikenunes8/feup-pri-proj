[Intro]
Ooh, I like it
[Verse 1]
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down, you shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me
[Chorus]
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Ooh, stay sweet
[Verse 2]
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up, you hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home
Ooh, you really do and you say
[Chorus]
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (Ooh, come on)
Stay sweet
[Bridge]
My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet, baby
Believe and we've got everything we need
(Got everything we need)[Chorus]
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Yeah, ooh, ooh)
Stay sweet (Stay sweet)
[Outro]
Oh, runaway
Come on
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Sweet lady
Woo!
