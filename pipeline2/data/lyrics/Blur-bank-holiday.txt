[Verse 1]
Grandma needs new dentures to eat the crust on pizza
Taken out by her daughter because she thought she oughta
The kids are eating Snickers because they're so delicious
Then there's sticky fingers then mother loses her knickers
[Chorus]
Bank holiday comes six times a year
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers
Bank holiday comes with a six pack of beer
And then it's back to work A-G-A-I-N
[Verse 2]
Barbecue is cooking sausages and chicken
The patio is buzzing and neighbours they are looking
John is down a fun pub drinking lots of lager
Girls and boys are on the game and all the high streets look the same
[Chorus]
Bank holiday comes six times a year
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers
Bank holiday comes with a six pack of beer
Then it's back to work A-G-A-I-N
[Instrumental break]
[Bridge]
Back to work A-G-A-I-N
[Chorus]
Bank holiday comes six times a year
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers
Bank holiday comes with a six pack of beer
Then it's back to work A-G-A-I-N
[Outro]
Bank holiday
