There is no
Castration fear
In a chair
You will be
With me
We'll dance
We'll dance
We'll dance
We'll dance
But no one will dance with us
In this zany town
Chim chim chim
 sing a song of praise
For your elders
They're in the back
Pick out some Brazilian nuts
For your engagement
Check that expiration date man
It's later than you think
You can't enjoy yourself
I can't enjoy myself
You can't enjoy yourself
I can't enjoy myself
Move that swing
And watch it break straight like an arc
But I won't be there to leave you
Ah ah ah
Cause I don't have a clue anymore
Maybe we could dance
Maybe we could dance
Maybe we could dance
Together
Together
Together
TogetherFirst time you’ll see
And then they’ll be
Five times forever
And you never get lost
