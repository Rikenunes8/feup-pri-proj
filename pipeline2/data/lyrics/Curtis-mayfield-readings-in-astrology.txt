[Verse 1]
Readings in astrology
Never meant that much to me
The woman I thought was just so
She now tells me we ain't compatible
She said see look right here on the paper
You should be lovin' your neighbour
Lovin' my neighbour is out of sight
But I'm your man and I'm just trying to do right
[Verse 2]
But I can see there's some trouble coming
Right here with this funky woman
But now the thoughts she had for me
Like I see is gone to some astrology
