We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall
Of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late
When they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew
Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life goes on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know - they can't see
Are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life goes on within you and without you
