[Verse 1]
I been ballin' a shiny black steel jack-hammer
Been chipping up rocks for the great highway
Live five years if I take my time
Ballin' that jack
 and a drinking my wine
I been chipping them rocks from dawn till doom
While my rider hide my bottle in the other room
Doctor say better stop balling that jack
If I live five years I gonna bust my back, yes I wil
l
[Chorus]
Easy wind 'cross the bayou today
'Cause there's a whole lot of women, mama
Out in red on the streets today
And the rivers keep a talking
But you never heard a word it said
[Verse 2]
Gotta find a woman be good to me
Won't hide my liquor try to serve me tea
'Cause I'm a stone jack baller and my heart is true
And I'll give everything that I got to you, yes I will
[Chorus]
Easy wind going 'cross the bayou today
There's a whole lot of women
Out in red on the streets today
And the rivers keep a talking
But you never heard a word it said
