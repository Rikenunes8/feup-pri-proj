[Verse 1]
The bell has tolled, my baby caught that train and gone
The bell has tolled, my baby caught that train and gone
It was all my fault, I musta' did somebody wrong
[Verse 2]
Everything that happens, you know I am to blame
Everything that happens, you know I am to blame
I'm gonna find myself a doctor, perhaps my luck will change
[Verse 3]
Ah, my mamma she told me, these days will surely come
I wouldn't listen to her, had to have my fun
The bell has tolled, my baby caught that train 'n gone
But it's all my fault, I musta' done somebody wrong, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
The bell has tolled, my baby caught that train 'n gone
The bell has tolled, my baby caught that train 'n gone
It was all my fault, I musta' did somebody wrong
Oh play the blues...
