Lies, dripping off your mouth like dirt
Lies, lie in every step you walk
Lies, whispered sweetly in my ear
Lies, how do I get out of here?
Why, why you have to be so cruel?
Lies, lies, lies, I ain't such a fool
Lies, lies in my Papa's looks
Lies, lies in my history books
Lies, lies like they teach in class
Lies, lies, lies, I catch on way too fast
Fire, fire upon your wicked tongue
Lies, lies, lies, you're trying to spoil my fun
Lies, lies you dirty Jezebel
Why, why, why, why don't you go to Hell?
Stop your lies, no my lies, no my lies, no my lies
Beautiful lies, no my lies, no my lies, no my lies
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
