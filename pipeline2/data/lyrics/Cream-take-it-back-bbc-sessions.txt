Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
Right away, far away
Take that thing right out of here
Don't let them take me to where streams are red
I want to stay here and sleep in my own bed
Need all your lovin', long blonde hair
Don't let them take me, 'cause I'm easily scared
Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
Right away, far away
Take that thing right out of here
I got this great need, the need to stay alive
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive
So come on, baby, don't go away
Just let them save me for a rainy day
Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
I got this need, the need to stay alive
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive
So come on, baby, don't go away
Just let them save me for a rainy day
Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
Right away, far away
Take that thing right out of here
I got this thing, I've got to keep it sharp
Don't go to places where it won't shine in the dark
So come on baby, don't go away
Just let them save me for a rainy day
Take it back, take it back
Take that thing right out of here
