This is a song about a superhero named Tony -- it's called "Tony's Theme"!
He got the oil on his chain for a ride in the rain, no baloney...
Ride around on my bicycle like a pony, I'm waving 'hi'...
Gimme a scream, give me, give me the theme of Tony
I am Tony, super bicycle Tony, I'm racing
Spitfire turn and pop a wheelie, burn and evil chasing
I'm waving 'bye'...
I got a card in my spokes, I'm practicing my joke, I'm learning Tony...
This is a song about a superhero named Tony -- it's called "Tony's Theme"!
I can't look at the sun if you give me some bad sunglasses
I'm back on the road, I cut my grass like I'm told after classes!
Tony...
