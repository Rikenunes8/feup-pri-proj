[Intro]
Uh
Whua
Wha
[Verse 1]
Well I've been bad
And I've been worse
And I'm a creep, yeah
And I'm a jerk
Come on
Touch me I'm sick
[Verse 2]
Ah
I won't be long
Then I pull a rock
And I'll throw it at you, boy
Are you paying our drugs?
[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me I'm sick
Yeah
Touch me I'm sick
[Chorus]
Come on baby now, come with me
You don't come
You don't come
You don't come
You'll die alone
[Verse 3]
Wha
Well, I'm diseased
And I don't mind
I'll make you love me
'Till the day you die
Come on touch me, I'm sick
Fuck me, I'm sick[Chorus]
Come on baby now, come with me
You don't come
You don't come
You don't come
You'll die alone
