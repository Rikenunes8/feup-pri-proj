[Verse 1]
Here lives a pocket full of life with no solution
Take it for what it is, it's only drunken lies
You should open up your mind, look to the future
You could be waiting for the ship that sails you home, I'm going home
[Verse 2]
What would you give me for the songs that I've been singing
How could you ever say that you've got more than me?
Mick says that he can never get no satisfaction
These days I think I know exactly what he means, what does he mean?
[Chorus]
You won't get, you don't get what you need
Life is a strange thing
You won't get, you don't get what you need
Life is a strange thing now
[Verse 1]
Here lives a pocket full of life with no solution
Take it for what it is, it's only drunken lies
You should open up your mind, look to the future
You could be waiting for the ship that sails you home, I'm going home
[Chorus]
You won't get, you don't get what you need
Life is a strange thing
You won't get, you don't get what you need
Life is a strange thing now
