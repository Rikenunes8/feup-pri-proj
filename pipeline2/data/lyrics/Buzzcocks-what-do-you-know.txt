[Verse 1: Pete Shelley]
Everything happens
Don't look for patterns
You only perceive what you believe
You need only believe to believe
A map of illusion
Of this land of confusion
I saw the boy clad in leather
Forever and ever and ever
[Refrain: Steve Diggle]
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
[Verse 2: Pete Shelley]
There's no turning back now
I'm under attack now
I don't need a mirror to see
Just what has happened to me
There's no contradiction
Between fact and fiction
I saw the skies open
And I heard the word spoken
[Refrain: Steve Diggle]
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
[Refrain: Steve Diggle]
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
[Verse 3: Pete Shelley]
Everything happens
Don't look for patterns
You only perceive what you believe
You need only believe, and you'll believe
A map of illusion
Of this land of confusion
I see the boy clad in leather
Forever and ever and ever[Outro: Pete Shelley,

(What do you know?)
 There's no turning back now
(What do you know?)
 I'm under attack now
(What do you know?)
 I see the skies are open
(What do you know?)
 And I hear the word spoken
What do you know?
What do you know?
(What do you know?)
 You only perceive what you believe
(What do you know?)
 You need only believe to believe
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
