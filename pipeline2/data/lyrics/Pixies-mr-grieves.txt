[Intro]
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
[Verse 1]
What's that floating in the water?
Ol' Neptuna's only daughter
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe in Mr. Grieves
[Chorus]
Do you have another opinion? (Yup!)
Do you have another opinion?
[Bridge 1]
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la
La la la la
[Verse 2]
Got bombed, got frozen
Got finally off to finally dozing
I believe in Mr. Grieves
[Chorus]
Do you have another opinion? (Yup! Opinion!)
Do you have another opinion?
Do you have another opinion?
[Bridge 2]
You can cry, you can mope
But can you swing from a good rope?
Oh, I believe in Mr. Grieves
[Outro]
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
