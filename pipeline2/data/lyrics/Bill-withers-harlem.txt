Summer night in Harlem
Man it's a really hot
Well it's too hot to sleep
And I'm too cold to heat
I don't care if I die or not
Winter night in Harlem
Oh, radiator won't get hot
Well the mean old landlord, a-he don't care
If I freeze to death or not
Saturday night in a-Harlem
Ah, everything's alright
You can really swing
And shake you're pretty thing
Uh, huh, baby, outtasight
Sunday mornin', here in a-Harlem
Now, everybody's all dressed up
While the hip folks
Gettin' a home from the party
And the good folks just got up
Ah, crooked delegation, wants a donation
To send the preacher to the holy land
Hey, hey Lord
Honey don't give your money
To that lyin', a-cheatin' man
