[Verse 1]
I have heard of a land on the far away strand
’Tis a beautiful home of the soul
It was built by Jesus, Jesus on high
There, there we'll never, never will die
’Tis a land where we never grow old
[Chorus]
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow old
[Verse 2]
In that beautiful home where we’ll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing
’Tis a land where we never shall die
[Chorus]
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow old
[Outro]
When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And our troubles and trials are over
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who’ve gone on before
