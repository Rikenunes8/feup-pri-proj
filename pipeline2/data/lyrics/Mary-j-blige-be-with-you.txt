[Intro]
(You know that I don't ever want to leave you)
I wanna be with you
(Does he care for you? Does he want you?)
I wanna be with you
(Does he even care?)
[Verse 1]
I can't deal with the fact that
You don't want me around
Why you wanna see me down?
It's so unusual
That you don't love me no more
Why you wanna close the door?
[Pre-Chorus]
I spent all my days and all my nights with you
Just tell me what am I gonna do without you
If loving you is so right
Tell me how I'll make it through the night
You know that I don't ever wanna leave you
[Chorus]
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
Nothing else I'd rather do
(I wanna be with you)
I want to spend my life with you
[Verse 2]
Let's take this time to think about
What was said and done
Now tell me why you had to run
Away from me
Now I can't sleep at night
Why we have to fight?
[Pre-Chorus]
Every day from you, I look and I see something new
Now tell me what I got to do to get this through to you
It's the little things you do for me
That make me very happy
You know that I don't wanna leave you[Chorus]
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you, be with you, be with you, yeah yeah
[Bridge]
(I wanna be with you)
It seems like each and ever time I come around
You don't want me there
And it's beginning to make me so scared
(I wanna be with you)
So scared that I might lose you
All I wanna do is be with you baby, baby, baby, baby boy
[Outro]
(I wanna be with you)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna pick up the phone, yeah
And, oh, it's you, you, you, ooh ooh, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
Oh, I wanna be with you
Oh baby, let me be with you, yeah
I need to be with you all day long
(I wanna be with you)
