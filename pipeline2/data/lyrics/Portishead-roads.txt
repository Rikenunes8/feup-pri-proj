[Verse 1]
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say
[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?
[Verse 2]
Storm in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right
[Verse 1]
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say
[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?
[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?
[Verse 1]
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say[Chorus]
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?
