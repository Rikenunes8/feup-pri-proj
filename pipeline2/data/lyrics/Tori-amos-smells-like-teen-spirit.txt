[Verse 1]
Load up on guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, oh
[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what, what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will be until the end
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
[Chorus]
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello
[Chorus]
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
Yes
[Outro]
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
A denial, a denial, a denial, yes
A denial
