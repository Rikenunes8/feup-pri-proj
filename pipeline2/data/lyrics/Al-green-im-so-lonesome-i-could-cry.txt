[Verse 1]
Did you hear that lonesome whip-poor-will?
He sounds too good to fly
The midnight train winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry
[Verse 2]
Did you ever see a night so long
When time goes crawling by?
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome that I feel I could cry, I could cry, oh, I'm gonna cry, baby, cry
[Bridge]
Did you see, ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Well, that means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I, I could cry, let me cry, said I was holding on now I could cry
[Verse 3]
The silence of (Silence of) a falling star (A falling star)
Lights up a purple sky (Oh)
And as I wonder (Wonder) where you are (Oh)
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry, I could cry
[Outro]
Oh, and as I wonder (Wonder) where you are (Oh, yeah)
I'm so lonesome I, I could cry (Ooh), if you let me, oh no
Somebody needs to walk on in, and I
As I wonder (Oh) where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry, I said I feel like I could just cry, yeah
It seems to me (Seems to me), as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome, I, I could cry, I could cry, I could cry (Cry, babe)
