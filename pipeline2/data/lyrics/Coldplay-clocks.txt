[
Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singin', come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'
[Chorus]
You are
You are
[Verse 2]
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin', come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
[Chorus]
You are
You are
You are
You are
[Chorus]
You are
You are
[Bridge]
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
[Chorus]
You are
You are[Outro]
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home
 
(You are)
 
home, where I wanted to go
Home
 
(You are)
 
home, where I wanted to go
