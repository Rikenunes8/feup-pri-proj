[Verse 1]
Do you remember the first kiss?
Stars shooting across the sky
To come to such a place as this
You never left my mind
[Verse 2]
I'm watching from the wall
As in the streets we fight
This world all gone to war
All I need is you tonight
[Chorus]
And I draw a line
To your heart today
To your heart from mine
A line to keep us safe
[Verse 3]
All through the rising sun
All through the circling years
You were the only one
Who could have brought me here
[Chorus]
And I draw a line
To your heart today
To your heart from mine
One line to keep us safe
And I draw a line
To your heart today
To your heart from mine
And pray to keep us safe[Outro]
Watch the stars now moving
Across the sky
Keep this feeling
Safe tonight
