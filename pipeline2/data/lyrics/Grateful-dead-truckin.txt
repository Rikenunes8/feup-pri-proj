[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on
[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit 
and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings
[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no
[Verse 2]
Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone
[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down
[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been
[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds
, 
vitamin C
, 
and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', 
you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on
[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in
[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on 
Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be
, oh no
[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been[Chorus 6]
Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home
