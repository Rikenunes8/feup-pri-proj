[Verse]
I can't believe you wanna to leave
When you know that'll hurt me so
Down on bended knee
Oh, beggin' please not to go
[Chorus]
Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that that'll drive me mad
[Verse]
My life, my heart
My love is in your hands
And now you gonna leave me
You gonna leave me for another man
[Chorus]
Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that'll drive me mad
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that'll drive me mad
