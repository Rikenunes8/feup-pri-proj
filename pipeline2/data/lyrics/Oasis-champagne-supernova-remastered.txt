[Verse 1]
How many special people change?
How many lives are livin' strange?
Where were you while we were gettin' high?
[Pre-Chorus]
Slowly walkin' down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were gettin' high?
[Chorus]
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Yeah, someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Wake up at dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
[Pre-Chorus]
Slowly walkin' down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were gettin' high?
[Chorus]
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Yeah, someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause people believe
That they're gonna get away for the summer
Yeah, you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinnin' round, we don't know why
Why, why, why, why?[Bridge]
Dear Prudence, would you come out to play?
Dear Prudence, would you come out and play?
Dear Prudence, with a brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence, won't you come out and play?
[Chorus]
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Yeah, someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
