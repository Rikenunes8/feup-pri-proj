As the floods of God
Wash away sin city
They say it was written
In the page of the Lord
But I was looking
For that great jazz note
That destroyed
The walls of Jericho
The winds of fear
Whip away the sickness
The message on the tablets
Was Valium
The planets form
That golden cross, Lord
I'll see You on
The holy crossroads
After all this time (Judgement day)
To believe in Jesus (Judgement day)
After all these drugs (Judgement day)
I thought I was him (Judgement day)
After all my lying and crying and suffering
I ain't good enough, I ain't clean enough to be him (On judgement day)
Oh no, oh no
The tribal wars (Judgement day)
Are burning up the homeland (Judgement day)
The fuel of evil (Judgement day)
Is raining from the sky (Judgement day)
The sea of lava (Judgement day)
Flowing down the mountain (Judgement day)
The time will sweep (Judgement day)
Us sinners by (Judgement day), by, byAfter all these years (Judgement day)
To believe in Jesus (Judgement day)
After all these drugs (Judgement day)
I thought I was him (Judgement day)
After all my lying and crying and suffering
I ain't good enough, I ain't clean enough to be him (On judgement day), no, no
I've taken one ride (Judgement day), go, go, let's go, (Judgement day)
Through Las Vegas (Judgement day)
You go to hell (Judgement day)
I'm given these sixguns (Judgement day)
Seven and elevens (Judgement day)
To roll (Judgement day)
Holy rollers roll (judgement day)
After all this time (Judgement day)
To believe in Jesus (Judgement day)
After all those drugs (Judgement day)
I thought I was him (Judgement day)
After all my lying and crying and suffering
I ain't good enough, I ain't clean enough to be him (On judgement day), oh no, oh no
After all these years (Judgement day)
To believe in Jesus (Judgement day)
After all those drugs (Judgement day)
I thought I was him (Judgement day)After all my lying and crying and suffering
I ain't good enough, I ain't clean enough to be him (On judgement day)
One take, one down on this roadless road (Judgement day) (Judgement day) (Judgement day) (Judgement day)
Listen give generously now (Judgement day)
Pass the hubcap please (Judgement day)
I don't think so, thank you (On judgement day)
After all this time (Judgement day)
To believe in Jesus (Judgement day)
After all those drugs (Judgement day)
I thought I was him (Judgement day)
After all my lying and crying and suffering
I ain't good enough, I ain't clean enough to be him
Lord, lord, lord, lord
(Judgement day) (Judgement day) (Judgement day)
