I get so lonely, I can't let just anybody hold me
You're the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
[Spoken: Lisa Marie Presley]
Hello?
[Spoken: Janet Jackson]
Hi, it's me
[Spoken: Lisa Marie Presley]
You got me on that damn speaker phone
[Spoken: Janet Jackson]

[Spoken: Lisa Marie Presley]
What you doin' with your hands that you can't pick up the phone?
[Spoken: Janet Jackson]
Don't you worry about it, I'm taking care of my business. What you doing?
[Spoken: Lisa Marie Presley]
Hold on. Let me just, okay, here we go, I'm back
