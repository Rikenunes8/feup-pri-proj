[Verse 1]
What I feel, I can't say
But my love is there for you anytime of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed
[Chorus]
Tell me, what is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
[Verse 2]
What I know, I can do
If I give my love now to everyone like you
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed
[Chorus]
Tell me, what is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
Tell me, what is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
[Verse 1]
What I feel, I can't say
But my love is there for you anytime of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed
[Chorus]
Tell me, what is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
Oh, tell me, what is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
[Chorus]
What is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
Oh, tell me, what is my life without your love?
And tell me, who am I without you by my side?
