[Intro]
2, 3, 4
[Verse 1]
I waited patiently for the Lord
He inclined and heard my cry
He brought me up out of the pit
Out of the miry clay
[Chorus]
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long, how long, how long
How long to sing this song?
[Verse 2]
You set my feet upon a rock
And made my footsteps firm
Many will see, many will see and fear
[Chorus]
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
