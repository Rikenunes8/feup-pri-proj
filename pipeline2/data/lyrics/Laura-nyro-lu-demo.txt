Silver was the color, winter was a snowbell
Mother of the wind boys, living off the lovewell with Lu
And everybody's calling Luie, Luie Luie, you got a thing about you
Keep the light going for Luie and Luie keeps on pushing through
Amber was the color, summer was a flame ride
Cooking up the noon roads, walking on God's good side
I was walking on God's good side, God's good side with Lu
And everybody's calling Luie, Luie Luie, you got a thing about you
Keep the light going for Luie and Luie keeps on pushing through
Keeps on pushing through, through, he keeps on pushing
I will always be fair, be there for Lu, forever and ever more
Everybody, everybody, everybody yeah
And everybody's calling Luie, calling Luie, everybody's calling Luie calling
My man, my man Luie, calling Luie, my man Luieâ€¦
