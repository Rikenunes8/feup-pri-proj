[Verse 1]
With one breath, with one flow
You will know 
synchronicity
A sleep trance, a dream dance
A shared romance, synchronicity
[Chorus]
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
[Verse 2]
If we share this nightmare
We can dream spiritus mundi
If you act as you think
The missing link, synchronicity
[Chorus]
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
Oh!
[Verse 3]
We know you, they know me
Extrasensory, synchronicity
A star fall, a phone call
It joins all, synchronicity
[Chorus]
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible[Verse 4]
It's so deep, it's so wide
You're inside synchronicity
Effect without a cause
Sub-atomic laws
Scientific pause
Synchronicity
[Outro]
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity, oh!
