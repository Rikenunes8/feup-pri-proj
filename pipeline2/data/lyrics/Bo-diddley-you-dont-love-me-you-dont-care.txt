[Verse 1]
You don't love me, you don't care
You don't want me hanging round here
Hanging round here, hanging round here
[Verse 2]
Well, I love you, yes, I do
Isn't nothing in the world I woudn't do for you
I wouldn't do for you, wouldn't do for you, I wouldn't do for you
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 3]
Yes, I saw you on the street
Tell you man you didn't love me, you didn't love me
You didn't love me, you didn't love me
[Piano Solo]
[Verse 4]
Yes, I need you, yes, I do
You know, pretty mama what I'll try for you
What I'll try for you, what I'll try for you
What I'll try for you, what I'll try for you
What I'll try for you, what I'll try for you
What I'll try for you, what I'll try for you
