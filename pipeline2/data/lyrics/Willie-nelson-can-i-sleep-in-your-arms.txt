[Chorus]
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you
And I assure you, I'll do you no wrong
[Verse]
Don't know why, but the one I love left me
Left me lonely and cold and so weak
And I need someone's arms to hold me
'Til I'm strong enough to get back on my feet
Can I sleep in your arms?
Can I sleep in your arms?
[Chorus]
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you I'll do you no wrong
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you I'll do you no wrong
