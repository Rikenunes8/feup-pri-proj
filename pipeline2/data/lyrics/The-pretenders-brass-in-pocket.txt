[Verse 1]
Got brass in pocket
Got bottle, I'm gonna use it
Intention, I feel inventive
[Bridge]
Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice
[Verse 2]
Got motion, restrained emotion
Been driving, Detroit leaning
No reason, just seems so pleasing
[Bridge]
Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice
[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me
[Verse 3]
Got rhythm, I can't miss a beat
Got new skank, it's so reet
Got something I'm winking at you
[Bridge]
Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice
[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me
[Outro]
Ohh
And when you walk
