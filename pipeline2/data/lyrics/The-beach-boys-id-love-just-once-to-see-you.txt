[Verse 1]
I'm doin' this and I'm doin' that
And I'm a-walkin' the floor
I drink a little of this and eat a little of that
And poke my head out the door
I get thinkin' I'm a-wasting the night away
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
Oh, honey, don't know how long it's been
But this feeling's buildin' up inside again
[Verse 2]
I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
Like a busy bee
I make up a song as I'm a-workin' along
No one's watching me
I wish that you were here to help me dry
When's the last time you baked me a pie?
You had a way of makin' it come alive
It's not too late for you to take a drive
[Bridge]
(Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[Outro]
It's not too late
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
In the nude
