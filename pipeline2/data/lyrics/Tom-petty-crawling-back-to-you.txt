[Verse 1]
Waiting by the side of the road
For day to break so we could go
Down into Los Angeles
With dirty hands and worn out knees
[Chorus]
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
[Verse 2]
The ranger came with burning eyes
The chambermaid awoke surprised
Thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head, let him in
[Chorus]
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
[Bridge]
Hey baby, there's somethin' in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do[Verse 3]
It was me and my sidekick
He was drunk and I was sick
We were caught up in a barroom fight
'Til an Indian shot out the lights
[Verse 4]
I'm so tired of being tired
Sure as night will follow day
Most things I worry about
Never happen anyway
[Chorus]
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
Ooh, I keep crawlin' back to you
I keep crawlin' back to you
