[Verse 1]
Catlong sighs holding Kitty's black tooth
She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth
And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley
Since Kitty left with Big Pretty things have got pretty thin
It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are muscling in
[Verse 2]
Jack Knife cries 'cause baby's in a bundle
She goes running nightly, lightly through the jungle
And them tin cans are exploding out in the ninety-degree heat
Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street
It's sad but it sure is true
Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?
[Verse 3]
Catlong lies back bent on a trash can
Flashing lights cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man
Well you better learn to move fast when you're young or you're not long around
Cat somehow lost his Kitty down in the city pound
So get right, get tight, get down
Well who's that down at the end of the alley?
She's been gone so long
Here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes
[Chorus]
Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)
Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)
Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Oh, Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)
Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)
[Verse 4]
Now Cat knows his Kitty's been untrue
And that she left him for a city dude
But she's so soft, she's so blue
When he looks into her eyes
He just sits back and sighs
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Ahahahaha (Alright, alright)[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh alright, oh, alright
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh alright, oh, alright
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh alright, oh, alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh alright, oh alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh alright, oh alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh alright, oh alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh alright, oh alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh alright, oh alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh alright, oh alright
