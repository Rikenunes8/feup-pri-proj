[Verse 1]
Wanda had a baby in 1951
The father was a stranger and a stranger was the son
Call that child James Lewis, call these rooms a home
Changing all them diapers, polish all that chrome
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
[Verse 2]
All around the schoolyard playing all the games
Running, laughing back and forth, the kid with two first names
Stranger in the closet, lock the diary
The past is running faster, singing harmony
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
[Verse 3]
"God bless this kitchen" said the knick-knack shelf
"The dinner's almost ready, go and wash yourself"
Well Jimmy's growing up now, Wanda's growing old
The time is growin' shorter, the nights are long and cold
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
[Verse 4]
Sneaking in the closet and through the diary
Now, don't you know all he saw was all there was to see
The whole town saw Jimmy on the six o'clock news
His brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
[Outro]
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
