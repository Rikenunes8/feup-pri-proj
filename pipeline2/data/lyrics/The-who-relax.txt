[Chorus]
Relax and settle down
Let your mind go round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band
Hold my hand
[Verse]
Open up your mind
We'll love right where we lie
I'll know you from inside
You're like a horse I'll ride
O'er the sand
Through the land
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
We try harder and harder, trying to get our way
But it's a long, long wait until Judgement Day
So settle your affairs and take your time
Because everything in the world is yours and mine
Yours and mine
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Relax!
