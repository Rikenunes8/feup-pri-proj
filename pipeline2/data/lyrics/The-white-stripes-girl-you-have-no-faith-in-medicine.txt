[Chorus]
Girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
, you see the medicine
Oh girl
[Verse 1]
Is there a way to find the cure for this implanted in a pill?
It's just the name upon the bottle which determines if it will
Is the problem you're allergic to a well familiar name?
Do you have a problem with this one if the results are the same
?
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
[Chorus]
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
, you see the medicine
Oh girl
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus (abbreviated)]
Girl, you have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
Oh girl
[Verse 3]
Well strip the bark right off a tree and just hand it this way
Don't even need a drink of water to make that headache go away
Give me a sugar pill and watch me just rattle down the street
[Outro]
Acetaminophen, you see the medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, you have no faith in medicine
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, oh girl
