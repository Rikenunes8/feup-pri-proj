[Chorus: Patti Austin, 
Michael Jackson
]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
)
[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I found myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause
[Pre-Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(All night)
[Verse 2: Patti Austin]
And though I am tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is sayin', "Come and do me!"
[Pre-Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the bed to see of what might be
But here I go fallin' again
[Chorus: Michael Jackson, 
Patti Austin
 & 
Both
]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Over you, 
over you
 (All night)
It's the fallin' in love
 (You got me fallin' in love)
Got me fallin' in love (
Being in love makes me
)
Cry, Cry, Cry[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin'
