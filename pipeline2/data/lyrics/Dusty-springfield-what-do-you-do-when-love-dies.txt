I wake up in the morning crying
I reach out for you, yeah
I make coffee for one now
Instead of for two
My days are so empty, baby
There's nothing for me to do
And the night lost its meaning
The night I lost you
Help me, baby
What do you when love dies?
Somebody help me, I'm losing my mind
What do you when love dies?
Somebody help me, I'm losing my mind
I run for the 1:10 uptown
The show starts at two
I'm surrounded by strangers
But I'm haunted by you
My life is without direction
Lost without you, my love
The past is my shadow
My shadow is you
I ain't got nowhere to go
What do you do when love dies?
Somebody help me, I'm losing my mind
What do you do when love dies on you?
Somebody help me, I'm losing my mind, yes I am, yeah
Yeah, what do you do when love dies on you?
Somebody help me, I'm losing my mind, yeah, yeah
Somebody help me, I'm losing my mind
The past is my shadow, my shadow is you
Yeah, yeah, what do you do when love dies on you?
