What moon songs do you sing your baby?
What sunshine do you bring?
Who belongs? Who decides who's crazy?
Who rights wrongs where others cling?
I'll sing for you if you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break
I go along just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you
And those moon songs that you sing your baby
Will be the songs to see you through
I'll hear your song, if you want me to
I'll sing along
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
So in love, I'm in love with you
With you, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
So in love, I'm in love with you
I'm, I'm so in love
I'm in love with you
