No way, no why
No care, no cry
No way, no sign
So fair, so fine
The way I see it
This relationship ain't right
The space between us
Better close it up tonight
No way, no why
No care, no cry
The space between us
Close it up tonight
No way, no sign
So fair, so fine
The way I see it
This relationship ain't right
The space
Listen here, listen, listen here, listen
We better close it up tonight
No way, no why
The space
No care, no cry
The space
No way, no sign
The space
So fair, so fine
No way, no why
The space
No care, no cry
The space
