[Verse 1]
She loves you right now, so don't close your eyes
She'll be talking and laughing with six other guys
Flirtatious and cute, she'll take you the route
Telling little girl lies
He loves her so much, he don't want to lose her
And there's no other girl he likes to ball better
But he's busy tonight, "We'll make it tomorrow"
He's telling his little girl lies
[Verse 2]
That's how the little girl lies
He's telling his little girl lies
Those little girl lies going to catch up to you
And you'll be sorry
[Verse 3]
Making excuses why she can't meet you later
She's not really ill, someone else got to date her
Mixed up and confused, it'll catch up to you
Telling little girl lies
[Outro]
They tell the little girl lies
He's telling his little girl lies
That's how your little girl lies
She's been telling you little girl lies
That's how his little girl lies
She been telling him little girl lies
Those little girl lies going to catch up to you
And you'll be sorry, boo-hoo
Boo-hoo
