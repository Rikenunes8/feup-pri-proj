The foreman over there hates the gang
The poor people on the porch get it so rough
The truck driver drives like a devil
The policemen, they're acting so tough
They need water
Good, good water
We need water
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say, no, to somebody's daughter
Sampson, seems sorta sweaty
The draftsmen they smudged their work
The captain of a ship is swimming
Then just wore off a keen bank clerk
We need water
Good, good water
We need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
C'mon, gimme good water
C'mon, gimme good water
C'mon, gimme good water
Please don't refuse me, mister
I've seen your daughter at the Oasis
And I'm beginning to blister
My Chevrolet just made steam
Your crop is laying foul
My grass skirt's lost its green
I'm alive, but I don't know how
We need water
Good, good water
We need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
Gimme good water
Indian Lake is burnin'
New York's skyline is hazy
The River Thames is turnin' dry
The whole world is ablazin'
We need water
Good, good water
We need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
Ah, gimme what I need
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
Gimme water
Water, water, water
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say, no, to somebody's daughter
Oh, no, whoa
No, no, no
