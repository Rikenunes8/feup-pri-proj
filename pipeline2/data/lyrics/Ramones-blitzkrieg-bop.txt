[Intro]
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
[Verse]
They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight one
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They're generatin' steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop
[Chorus]
Hey, ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go
[Verse]
They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They're generatin' steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop
[Chorus]
Hey, ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go
[Verse]
They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They're generatin' steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop[Outro]
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
