[Verse 1]
Hold me
Kiss me
Show me
You wanna be with me
Feel me
Taste me
And maybe
I'll let you have me
[Pre-Chorus]
When you do convince me
Can't turn back
I'll be your best
You know that good things don't come easy
[Chorus]
(Hold me)
So are you ready
(Kiss me)
To journey
(Show me)
Within me
(Feel me)
I'll satisfy you
(Taste me)
I will do anything
(Have me)
You ask me to
(Ask me)
Anything
(With me)
Anything
