[Opening Instrumental Riff]
[Verse 1]
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
[Chorus]
Layla,
 you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
[Verse 2]
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
It turned my whole world upside down
[Chorus]
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
[Verse 3]
So make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain
[Chorus]
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind?[Instrumental Outro]
