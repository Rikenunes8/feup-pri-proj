[Verse 1]
There'll come a time when all of us must leave here
There's nothing sister Mary can do
Will keep me here with you
As nothing in this life that I've been trying
Can equal or surpass 
the art of dying
Do you believe me?
[Verse 2]
There'll come a time when all your hopes are fading
When things that seemed so very plain
Become an awful pain
Searching for the truth among the lying
And answered when you've learned the art of dying
Are you still with me?
[Bridge]
But if you want it
Then you must find it
But when you have it
There'll be no need for it
[Verse 3]
There'll come a time when most of us return here
Brought back by our desire to be
A perfect entity
Living through a million years of crying
Until you've realized the art of dying
Can you believe me?
