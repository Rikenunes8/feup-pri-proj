[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what you know good?
I'm just getting back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start getting together again?
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said?
What else is new my friend, besides what I read?
[Verse 2]
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand what's going on across this land?
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening? What's happening my man?
[Verse 3]
Are they still getting down where we used to go and dance?
Will our ball club win the pennant, do you think they have a chance?
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me what's out and I want to know what's in
[Verse 4]
What's the deal man
What's happening? What's happening brother?
What's happening brother?
Ah, what's happening brother?
What's happening my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?
Say man, whoo, what's happening brother?[Outro]
What's been shaking up and down the line?
I want to know, because I'm slightly behind the times
