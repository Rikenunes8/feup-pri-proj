[Verse 1]
Gonna build myself a castle
High up in the clouds
There'll be skies outside my window
Lose these streets and crowds
[Chorus]
Dance the night away
[Verse 2]
Will find myself an ocean
Sail into the blue
Live with golden swordfish
Forget the time of you
[Chorus]
Dance the night away
[Verse 3]
Dance myself to nothing
Vanish from this place
Gonna turn myself to shadow
So I can see your face
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Dance the night away
