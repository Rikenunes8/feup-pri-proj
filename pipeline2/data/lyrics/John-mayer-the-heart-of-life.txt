[Verse 1]
I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen
[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
[Verse 2]
You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining
[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
[Outro]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good
