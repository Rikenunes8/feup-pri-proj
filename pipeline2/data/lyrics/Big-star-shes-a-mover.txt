She don't believe anything and she can
Dance oh now all night
So wild when she's a mover
She's so wild
Draggin fast we go
Ooh I dig speed so good
It destroy her in the cruiser
It destroyer
She name was Marsha
Marsha the name
She look like a dove now
And when she smile like crocodile
She tells the man to go to hell
And where that's at is where I'm coming
From
So wild ooh she's a mover
She like devil you know
She finds herself in Catholic school
She's wild
