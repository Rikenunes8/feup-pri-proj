It's night time where the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tick of the eye of the clock
You're standing up against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the rain drops
When the sun shines through
So a voice within me
Keeps revealing you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far, it's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you, night and day
Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic gloom in the silence of my lonely room
I think of you, night and day
Night and day, under the hide of me
Though such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me
This torment won't be through 'til you let me spend
My life making love to you, day and night, night and day
Night and day, under the hide of me
Oh, such a hungry yearning, burning, burning inside of me
This torment won't be through 'til you let me spend
My life making love to you, day and night, night and day
Night and day, night and day
Night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night and day, night, night and day
Night and day
Lovers too
Only loving you
I need you baby
Say that you doNight and day
