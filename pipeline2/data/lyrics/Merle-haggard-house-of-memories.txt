[Verse]
My house of memories is all I own
I live in misery now that you're gone
A constant reminder of what used to be
Is torturing me in my house of memories
[Verse]
My house is a prison where memories surround me
There's no place to hide where your memory won't find me
For my house of memories is all I own
I'm all alone in my house of memories
[Verse]
My house is a prison where memories surround me
There's no place to hide where your memory won't find me
For my house of memories is all I own
And I'm all alone in my house of memories
In my house of memories
