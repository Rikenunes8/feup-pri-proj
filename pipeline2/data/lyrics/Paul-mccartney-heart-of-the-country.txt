[Verse 1]
I look high, I look low
I'm looking everywhere I go
Looking for a home in the heart of the country
I'm gon' move, I'm gon' go
I'm gon' tell everyone I know
Looking for a home in the heart of the country
[Chorus]
Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
Woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
Want a horse, I want a sheep
I wanna get me a good night's sleep
Living in a home in the heart of the country
I'm gon' move, I'm gon' go
I'm gon' tell everyone I know
Living in a home in the heart of the country
[Chorus]
Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
Woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
Want a horse, I got a sheep
I'm gonna get me a good night's sleep
Living in a home in the heart of the country
I'm gon' move, I'm gon' go
Gon' tell everyone I know
In the heart of the country
[Chorus]
Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
Woah, woah, woah
