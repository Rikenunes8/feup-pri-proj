[Verse 1]
Dick got the girl and he sailed around the world
Why not? What else have you got?
If you're not in the boat that... hello
Love will give me the moon, whoops
[Chorus]
Way beyond these voices
And out of the groove
In a dream, forever starts when you wake up
Starts when you wake up
[Verse 2]
Dick got the girl and he sailed around the world
What? Oh, yeah, sorry, around the world
Why not? What else has he got?
I don't know, and I know, I don't know
Love will give me the moon, oh dear
[Chorus]
Far beyond these voices
And out of the groove
In a dream, forever starts when you wake up
Starts when you wake up
