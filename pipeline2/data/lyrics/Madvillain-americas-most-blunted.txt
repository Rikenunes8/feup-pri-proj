Come out to show them
Like, open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them, come out to show them
Come out to show them, come out to show them, come out to show them
Music
Bad weed right there, infectious
Listening to music while stoned is a whole new world
To' up man
Most cannabis consumers report it second only to sex
 (
Woo
)
And grass will change your musical habits, for the better

A-, A-, A-, America's most blunted
Blunted, blunted, blunted, blunted, blunted
Where the trees at?
Soon as he start sleepin', catchin' you off guard
â€”Me rhythm now, huh?
(If you'll all gather close around the phonograph)
Let that thang burn
(
Who those motherfuckers comin' in here?
No, it can't be
)
Where Quas at?
(
Yo
)
(
Catch you coming out your crib, nigga
)
DOOM, you got the trees?

Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the bar-code (
Yeah
, Woo)
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or sit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip (
Yes
)
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black & Mild (
Haha
)
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop-n-Go Mart, actin' like a spirit host done it
America's most blunted
 (Yeah, yo)
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well (
Ugh
)
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha-ed, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full (
Haha
)
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (
True
)
Sometimes you might need to detox (
A-, a-, a-
)
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beat-box (
A-, a-, a-
)
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes (
A-, a-, a-
)
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it (
A-, a-, a-
)[Chorus: Phil Da Agony,

America's most blunted
Blunted, blunted
Haha, ha, hey
Comin' kinda stupid from the station
Blunted, blunted
Haha, haha
Amazing loops, loops, lyrical hoops
-The universal
Sal, sal, sal, sal, sal, sal
(The-th-the-best, the-th-best, the-the-the, the best in your perimeter)
Sweeter, woop
Yo, I can't find that nigga Metal Face nowhere
A-, a-, a-, a-
America's most blunted
Oh, alright
Alright
Blunted, blunted, blunted, blunted, blunted

DOOM, the Madvillain killing mad boom
Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The Beat Konducta smoke twenty-four-seven
Shady, 
you can even ask my reverend
Willie knows
, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my
 
last dough
 
to pick up the sticky gold
 (Oh shit)
I spark the
 
lah
, but don't **** with speed (
Shh
)
Or trees with seeds, 
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
(
Tried to tell-
)
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat, when you try to react
Shut the **** up! Even your pops got smacked
 (Ooh)
Even your moms got cracked
Meanwhile, while my bowl got packed
Drop X so you can have good sex
 (What, no)
I smoke 
dank
 
so I
 
can grow me a shank
 (Watch this here)
I got the fat sack, shh all day I hunt it
Who are we?

Creativity, it's a known fact that grass increases creativity
From eight, to 11 times. In fact, everyone finds that they're more creative stoned, than straight
So remember:
