[Chorus]
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
[Outro]
Give me something to do!
