[Verse 1]
The last word
Is the lost word
Why don't you say so?
Say so
[Pre-Chorus]
I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores
[Chorus]
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
[Verse 2]
Now, you give me no trouble
And you give me no help
It is the clown
That works so well
[Pre-Chorus]
I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores
[Chorus]
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
[Verse 3]
Our lips are sealed
Our breath is burning
These cold, wild seas
Have left us turning
[Pre-Chorus]
But I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores
[Chorus]
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
