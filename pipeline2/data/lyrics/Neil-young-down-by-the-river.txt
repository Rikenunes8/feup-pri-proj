[Verse 1]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) Yeah
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) She could drag me over the rainbow
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) And send me away
[Chorus]
Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, ooh
Shot her dead, ooh
[Guitar Solo 1]
[Verse 2]
You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) Yeah, ooh, yeah
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) She could drag me over the rainbow
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) And send me away, yeah
[Chorus]
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, dead, ooh
Ooh, shot her dead
Shot her dead[Guitar Solo 2]
[Verse 1]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) Ooh, yeah
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) She could drag me over the rainbow
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) And send me away, yeah
[Chorus]
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
