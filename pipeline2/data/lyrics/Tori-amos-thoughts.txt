[Verse 1]
Thoughts right now
I picked up a magazine
Oh, here they go: fifteen hundred years
Fifteen hundred years right here
Oh, burning witches, burning books
Burning babies in their looks
Yes, indeed
Burning everything that's sacred in my genes, yes
[Verse 2]
Oh, thoughts right now
She's been everybody else's girl
Thoughts right now
Thoughts right now, right, right now
Am I here, oh am I here?
I'm never here, I'm never here, I'm never here
I am never, never a bird
In the flower, in the tree
In the pain of the respect thereof, yes indeed
[Verse 3]
Thoughts right now
What will become of me, become of her
Become of we, babe? Yeah
