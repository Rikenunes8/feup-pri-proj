[Chorus]
Woman, oh why, why, why, why, why
What have I done?
Oh, woman, oh, where, where, where, where, where
Did you get that gun?
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?
[Verse 1]
Well, I met her at the bottom of a well (Of a well)
Well, I told her I was trying to break a spell (Break a spell)
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't get by, my hands are tied
I don't know why I ever got her to try myself
'Cause I can't get by, my hands are tied
[Chorus]
Oh, woman, oh why, why, why, why, why
What have I done?
Oh, woman, oh, where, where, where, where, where
Did you get that gun?
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, woman, what have you done?
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm fed up with your lying, cheating ways (Cheating ways)
But I get up every morning and every day (Every day)
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't get by, my hands are tied
I don't why I want her to try myself
'Cause I can't get by, my hands are tied
[Chorus]
Oh, woman, oh why, why, why, why, why
What have I done?
Oh, woman, oh, where, where, where, where, where
Did you get that gun?
Woman, what, hey, what have I done?
Oh, what have you done?
Woman what have I done?[Outro]
Oh!
Oh woman, why? Baby, baby
Woman, why?
Baby baby baby baby
Woman why?
Woman oh why?
Oh woman, oh why, oh why, oh why?
Oh
