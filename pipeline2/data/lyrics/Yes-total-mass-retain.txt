My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
Theres you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we dont understand
Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be
Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river
Sudden problems shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that youve ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain
Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
