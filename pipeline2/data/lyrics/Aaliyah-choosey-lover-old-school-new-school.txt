[Chorus]
Choosey lover
Boy I’m so proud of you
I’m so glad you chose me, baby (Baby)
And I’ll make you so happy
[Verse 1]
(Thought I had a lover)
Thought I had a lover
But I was kidding myself, baby
(By the time I learned about it)
By the time I learned the truth about it
He was sleeping with someone else
But not you baby
[Chorus]
Choosey lover
Boy I’m so proud of you
I’m so glad you chose me, baby (Baby)
And I’ll make you so happy
[Verse 2]
'Cause you're giving me (Giving me security)
Giving me security, baby
And you’ve proven what you said (Ohh)
(I never worried about you)
Never worried about you baby
Jumping in and out of bed
Ohhhh, but not my baby[Chorus x3]
Choosey lover (You're so choosey)
Boy I’m so proud of you
I’m so glad you chose me, baby
And I’ll make you so happy
(Beat switches)
[Chorus]
Choosey lover
Boy I’m so proud of you
I’m so glad you chose me, baby
And I’ll make you so happy
[Verse 3]
Thought I had a lover
But I was kidding myself, baby
By the time I learned about it
He was sleeping with someone else
Baby, baby, baby
[Chorus]
Choosey lover
Boy I’m so proud of you
I’m so glad you chose me, baby
And I’ll make you so happy[Verse 4]
'Cause you’ve given me, given me security
Giving me security, baby

See I never worry about you
Jumping in and out of bed
[Chorus]
