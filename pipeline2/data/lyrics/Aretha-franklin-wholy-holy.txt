[Intro]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
[Verse]
Woah, holy wholly
Come together wholly
People, we have got to come together
With all of the strength
Have all of the feeling, yeah
Why, holy wholly
Come on, check out the water now, now
Water holy wholly
We should believe
Believe in each other's dreams
Jesus left a long time ago
And said he would return
But he left us a book to believe in
And in it, we've got a whole lot to learn
Yeah, yeah, woah, holy wholly
He can't talk out
Can't walk out now
Holy, holy, holy
We can rock this Earth's foundation
Yes, we can (Glory)
Can't you see us, brothers and sisters? (Glory)
Talking about love, love, love, love, love (Love, love, love, love, love)
Ooh-hoo-hoo, holy wholly
We can rock
We can rock this Earth's foundation
Mhm (Wholly holy)
Wholly, Wholly (Wholly holy)
Can't you see us coming together? (Wholly)
Talking 'bout love, moving and grooving with a-love (Holy)
Let it get men with a-love (Wholly holy)
Doing and moving it with love, love, love, love, love, love
Woah, holy wholly
He proclaimed love, he proclaimed love
About salvation, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
Woah, wholly holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Wholly holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Wholly holy, holy, holy, holy
Wholly holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Wholly holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
[Outro]
Love right now, love, brother
Love right now, love
