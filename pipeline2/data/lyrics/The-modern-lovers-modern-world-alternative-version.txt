Well there's sex in the sunny day
That shines down on Bolyston Street
And I love the USA
So share the USA with me
'Cuz I'm in love with the USA now (I love the USA)
I'm in love with the modern world now(I love the modern world)
Put down the cigarette
And drop out of B.U
Alright.That's right
Well out in the afternoon
Out in the arid plane
We'll share a modern love
Under suburban rain
And me in love with the USA now ( I love the USA)
And me in love with the modern world now (I love the modern world)
Put down the cigarette
And act like a true girl, oh
Well out on route 9
Well it's bleak and nearly dying
Stop all this weak stuff
And drop out of B.U.!
With me in love with the USA now (I love the USA)
With me in love with the modern world now (I love the modern world)
Put down the cigarette
And drop out of high school, oh!
Oh, thats right
Well I'm in love with the USA now (I love the USA)
Well I'm in love with the modern world now (I love the modern world)
Put down the cigarette
And act like a true girlWell listen
Well the modern world is not so bad
Not like the students say
In fact I'd be in heaven
If you'd share the modern world with me
We'd be in love with the USA now (I love the USA)
We'd be in love with the modern world now (I love the modern world)
Put down the cigarette
And share the modern world with me!
