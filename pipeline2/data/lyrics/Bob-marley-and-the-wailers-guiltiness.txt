[Verse 1]
Guiltiness (talking about guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience
And they live their lives (they live their lives)
On false pretence everyday
Each and everyday
These are the big fish
Who always try to eat down the small fish
(These are the big fish)
A just the small fish
I tell you again: 
they would do anything
To materialize their every wish
[Chorus]
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sad tomorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
[Verse 2]
Guiltiness
(Talk about guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience
These are the big fish
(These are the big fish)
Who always try to eat down the small fish
A just the small fish
[Bridge]
I tell you what: they would do anything(anything)
To materialize their every wish
[Chorus]
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sad tomorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow[Outro]
Guiltiness
They'll eat the bread of sorrow everyday
