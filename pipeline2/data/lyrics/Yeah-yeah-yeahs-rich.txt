[Verse 1]
I'm Rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out, boy
So stuck up
I wish you'd stick it to me
Flesh ripped off
[Chorus]
Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one, no one, no one, no speaking at all!
[Verse 2]
She slipped
Down a rot drink
Well, unzipped
She doesn't exist
So unloved
I took 'em standing up
So stuck up
Ah
I'm Rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out, boy
I'll take you out, boy
[Chorus]
Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one, no one, no one, no speaking at all!
Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one, no one, no one, no speaking at all!Rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
