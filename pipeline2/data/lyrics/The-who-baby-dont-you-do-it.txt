[Intro]
Ah, baby, don't you do it, don't do it, baby
Don't you break my heart
Please, don't do it, baby, don't you break my heart
Please, don't you do it, baby
Yeah, I sacrifice to make laughter, kept nothing for myself
Now you want to leave me for the love of someone else
[Chorus]
I'm trying to do my best
Yeah, I'm trying to do my best
Don't you do it, don't do it, babe
Don't you break my heart
Please, don't you do it, babe
[Verse 1]
My biggest mistake was loving you too much, and letting you know
Because now you got me where you want me, and you gonna let me go
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I need you, baby, I'm gonna keep on keeping on
[Chorus]
I'm trying to do my best
Yeah, I'm trying to do my best
Don't do it, baby
Don't you break my heart now
[Chorus]
I go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm going to jump right in, baby, if you don't see about me
I'm trying to do my best
Yeah, I'm trying to do my best
Don't do it, baby
[Verse 2]
Open up your eyes, can't you see I need you?
Open up your heart, can't you see I love you?
I can't go on without you, my life's no good without you[x2]
[Outro/Chorus]
Yeah, don't you do it
Please, don't do it, baby
Don't you break my heart now
