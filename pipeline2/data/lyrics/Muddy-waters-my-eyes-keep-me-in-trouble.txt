[Verse]
My eyes keep me in trouble
Wants every woman I see
My eyes keep me in trouble
I want every woman I see
Ahh you pretty women kill me
Just come on and get poor me
I love to love pretty women
Any girl who'll join my pack
I love to love pretty women
Any girl who'll join my pack
I want to love pretty women
Until their hair turns back
I want women on my left, women on my right
Women all day, women all night
I want to love pretty women
That is a natural fact
I want to love pretty women
Any girl who'll join my pack
My eyes keep me in trouble
That is a natural fact
My eyes keep me in trouble
That is a natural fact
I want to love pretty women
Until their hair turns back
