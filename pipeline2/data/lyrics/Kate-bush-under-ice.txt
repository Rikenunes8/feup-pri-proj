[Intro]
It's wonderful
Everywhere, so white
[Verse 1]
The river has frozen over
Not a soul on the ice
Only me
Skating fast
[Verse 2]
I'm speeding past trees
Leaving little lines in the ice
Cutting out
Little lines
In the ice
Splitting, splitting sound
Silver heels
Spitting, spitting snow
[Verse 3]
There's something moving under
Under the ice
Moving under ice
Through water
Trying to
It's me
Get out of the cold water
It's me
Something
It's me
Someone - help them!
