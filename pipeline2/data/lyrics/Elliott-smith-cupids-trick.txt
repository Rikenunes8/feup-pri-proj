[Verse 1]
She's shaking down
I'm absent and numb from shock
Reaching around for the hands of the clock
Sugar lie
[Chorus]
Lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up
[Verse 2]
Cupid's trick comes down to shake and deal
A stupid kick that makes me reel
Sugar lie
[Chorus]
Lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up
[Verse 3]
She's shaking down
It's never over and done
So kick me, cane me
Then I'll know why
[Chorus]
Lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lick me up
