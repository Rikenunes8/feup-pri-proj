Come here baby, sit down on daddy's knee
Come here baby, sit down on daddy's knee
I got stuff to tell you
Baby, that worry me
You went out last night, baby, you stayed all night
You went out last night, baby, you stayed all night
You've been snubbing and what
Well, woman, you ain't treat me right
I cried, cried, cried, all day long
I cried, cried, I cried all day long
You got to wear your own
Baby, you canâ€™t have your way
Woke up this mornin', baby, I found you gone
Woke up this mornin', baby, I found you gone
I'm crazy 'bout you
But you know you've done me wrong
