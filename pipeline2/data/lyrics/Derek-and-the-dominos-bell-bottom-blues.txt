[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Bell bottom blues, you made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms
[Chorus]
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
[Verse 2]
It's all wrong, but it's alright
The way that you treat me baby, mmh
Once I was strong but I lost the fight
You won't find a better loser
[Chorus]
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
(Oh, yeah-yeah)
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it 'cause
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay[Verse 3]
Bell bottom blues
, don't say goodbye
We're surely gonna meet again
And if we do, don't you be surprised
If you find me with another lover, oh
[Chorus]
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it 'cause
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
[Outro]
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
