[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I see danger, danger, danger
All on the corner sent by me
Shadows the ways
Straight away you ran from me
[Chorus]
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
[Verse 2]
I hear silence
I hear silence in my heart
From a distance
Turn your back and run from me
[Chorus]
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
[Verse 3]
When it happens
You will be no friend of mine
Take the first chance
When I am no longer free
[Chorus]
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
[Verse 4]
In the future
When you want me in your heart
I won't be there
If you call out in the dark[Chorus]
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Oh yes, I heard you, heard you, heard you, heard you calling
[Bridge]
Can you hear me deep inside?
From these feelings I can't hide
Can you hear me deep inside?
From these feelings I can't hide
Oh, can you hear me deep inside? (Can you hear me calling you?)
From these feelings I can't hide (Can you hear me calling you?)
[Outro]
Can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me calling you?
