[Verse 1: 3D]
Recollect me darling, raise me to your lips
Two undernourished egos, four rotating hips
Hold on to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale
Can't endure, then you can't inhale clearly
Out of body experience interferes
And dreams of flying, I fit nearly
Surrounds me, though I get lonely slowly
[Chorus: 3D]
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
She's moving up slowly, slowly
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
[Verse 2: 3D]
In my home no chrome as clear as
See me now with my nearest, dearest
Been there when I'm over careering
Room shifting is endearing
Between us is our kitchen
Which you found my irritant's itching
Been here before, been here forever
[Chorus: 3D]
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
Inertia keeps
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
Moving up slowly
She comes
Moving up slowly
Inertia creeps
Moving up slowly
She comes[Verse 3: 3D]
I make no sound in my eider-down
Awake I lie in the morning's blue
Room is still, my antenna in you
Nylon burns the bedspread with two
Gravity's zero, see me stall
I bounce off walls, lose my footing, and fall
Can be sweet though incomplete though
And the frames will freeze, see me on all fours
It's been a long time
[Interlude: 3D]
She comes
She comes
I want to x you
She comes
I want to x you
She comes
X
[Outro: 3D]
I caught your radio waves
I caught your radio waves
With a tin can and string
Say you string me along
Say you string me along
Say inertia creeps
Inertia creeps and she comes
Say she comes
Say she comes
Say she comes
Say she comes
