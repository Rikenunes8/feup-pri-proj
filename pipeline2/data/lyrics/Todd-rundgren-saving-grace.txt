[Verse]
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
Because I know someday
Someone else will see it my way
And then I'll know I was not wrong
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
They think that I'm no good
But I will make myself understood
'Cause I believe it all along
[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
When they finally see
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
When they finally see the saving grace in me
[Bridge]
I know the time is gonna come
When I will mean something to someone
Until that day I'm hanging on
[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
When they finally see
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
When they finally see the saving grace in me[Chorus - Outro]
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
When they finally see
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
When they finally see the saving grace in me
I think I'm gonna love it
I think I'm gonna love it
When they finally see
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it
I know they won't believe it...
