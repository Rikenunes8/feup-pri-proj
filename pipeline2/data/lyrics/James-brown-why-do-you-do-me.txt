[Verse 1]
Why did it happen this way
Someone has taken my place
You want to share my embrace
Why do you do me like you do
[Chorus 1]
I give my heart to you
Like noone never do
Im just so lonely and blue
Why do you do me like you do
[Chorus 2]
Way down inside me
There is noone after for you
Deep down inside me
There is noone after you
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Way down inside me
Where's noone else but you
Deep down inside me
There noone else but you[Chorus 1]
