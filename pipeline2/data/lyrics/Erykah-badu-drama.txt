[Intro]
The world is so dramatic
[Pre-Hook]
I can't believe
That we're still livin'
Oh in this crazy crazy world
That I'm still livin'
[Hook]
With all the problems of the day
How can we go on?
So tired of hearing people say
How can we go on?
[Post-Hook]
Fantasy people
Make believe people
How can you go on
But you're still livin'
[Pre-Hook]
I can't believe
That we're still livin'
Oh in this crazy crazy world
That I'm still livin'
[Hook]
With all the problems of the day
How can we go on?
So tired of hearing people say
How can we go on?
[Post-Hook]
Fantasy people
Make believe people
How can you go on
But you're still livin'
[Verse 1]
Race relations, segregation, no occupation
World inflation, demonstration, miseducation
No celebration to celebrate your lives[Refrain]
Listen people listen
Lift up your hearts to God
Teach your children Wisdom
Reality today so they can live tomorrow
[Pre-Hook]
I can't believe
That we're still livin'
Oh in this crazy crazy world
That I'm still livin'
[Hook]
With all the problems of the day
How can we go on?
So tired of hearing people say
How can we go on?
[Post-Hook]
Fantasy people
Make believe people
How can you go on
But you're still livin'
[Refrain]
Listen people listen
Lift up your hearts to God
Teach your children Wisdom
Reality today
