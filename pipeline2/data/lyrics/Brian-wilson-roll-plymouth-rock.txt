[Verse 1]
Waving from the ocean liner
Beaded cheering Indians behind them
[First Refrain]
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
[Second Refrain]
Ribbon of concrete, just see what you done
Done to the church of the American Indian
[Verse 2]
Once upon the Sandwich Isles
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii
[First Refrain]
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
[Second Refrain]
Bicycle rider, just see what you've done
Done to the church of the American Indian
[Third Refrain]
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
[First Refrain]
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
Wooh
