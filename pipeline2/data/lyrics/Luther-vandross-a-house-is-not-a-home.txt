[Verse 1]
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Woah girl
[Verse 2]
A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
[Refrain]
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears
[Verse 3]
Pretty little darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there
Sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah
[Verse 4]
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there, still in love
I said, still in love
Still in love with me, yeah
Are you gonna be in love with me?
I want you and need you to be, yeah
Still in love with me
Say you're gonna be in love with me
It's drivin' me crazy to think
That my baby couldn't be still in love with meAre you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Well well, well well
Still in love, so in love, still in love with me
Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna be
Still in love with me, yeah
With me, oh
Still in love with me, yeah
