[Verse 1]
I may go out tomorrow if I can borrow a coat to wear
Oh, I'd step out in style with my sincere smile and my dancing bear
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Outrageous, alarming
Courageous, charming
[Chorus]
Oh, who would think a boy and bear
Could be well accepted everywhere
It's just amazing how fair people can be
[Verse 2]
Seen at the nicest places the well-fed faces all stop to stare
Making the grandest entrance is Simon Smith and his dancing bear
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll love us, won't they?
They feed us, don't they?
[Chorus]
Oh, who would think a boy and bear
Could be well accepted everywhere
It's just amazing how fair people can be
[Verse 3]
Who needs money when you're funny?
The big attraction everywhere
Will be Simon Smith and his dancing bear
It's Simon Smith and the amazing dancing bear
