[Verse 1]
Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall
[Verse 2]
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall
[Bridge]
Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the, huh
Lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I have nothing to lose
Long as I have you
[Verse 3]
Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall
[Outro: Guitar solo]
