[Verse 1]
Ooh, ooh, I'm so blue
'Cause I'm worried over you
Oh I, I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you
You promised to write me
Each and every day
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away
Ooh, ooh, I sit by my window pane
Hoping for a letter, one that never came
My heart cries for just one little line
Anything to say you're mine
Oh, oh
Oh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Well, I said a prayer every night
Hoping, hoping and praying
Someday, someday you'd write
Oh, oh, my heart cries for one little line
Anything to say you're mine
