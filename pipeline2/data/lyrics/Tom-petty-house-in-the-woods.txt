[Verse 1]
I'm goin' down to the house in the woods
See my little darlin'
I'm goin' down, out in the fields
With summertime comin'
[Chorus 1]
And oh, my love, what can I do
What can I do but love you?
For the rest of my days, the rest of my nights
What can I do but love you, babe?
[Verse 2]
Summertime falls on the house in the woods
Back by the power lines
I ain't got a neighbor for nine or ten miles
Back in the tall pines
[Chorus 2]
And hey, now, baby, what can I do?
What am I gonna do but trust you?
The rest of my nights, the rest of my days
What can I do but love you, babe?
[Chorus 1]
Hey, now, baby, what can I do?
What am I gonna do but love you?
The rest of my days, the rest of my nights
What could I do but love you, babe?
