[Verse 1]
A legacy so far removed
One day will be improved
Eternal rights we left behind
We were the better kind
Two the same, set free too
[Chorus]
I always looked to you
I always looked to you
I always looked to you
[Verse 2]
We fought for good, stood side by side
Our friendship never died
On stranger waves, the lows and highs
Our vision touched the sky
Immortalists with points to prove
[Chorus]
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
[Verse 3]
A house somewhere on foreign soil
Where aging lovers call
Is this your goal, your final needs
Where dogs and vultures eat
Committed still I turn to go
[Chorus]
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
In you. In you. In you
Put my trust in you, in you
