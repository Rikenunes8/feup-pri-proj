[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...
[Chorus]
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
[Verse 2]
From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah
[Chorus]
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry
[Chorus]
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman[Bridge]
It's all I wanna be, is all, a woman
For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be
[Outro]
I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you
