I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
Finally baby, the truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit, it's crying out loud
Try to believe, you say you love me but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
Finally baby, the truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
That's nothing that I didn't know
Trying to survive
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hangin' on to you
I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, take a little time
I, I don't want to know
