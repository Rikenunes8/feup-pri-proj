[Verse 1]
All of me belongs to you all the time
You're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's no way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
'Cause all of me belongs to you
[Verse 2]
Eyes are worthless 'cause you're not here to see
My lips are so forgotten since you've forgotten me
My arms ache from reaching out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
'Cause all of me belongs to you
[Verse]
Fingers claw the darkness in my dream
Searching for a love I lost but can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
There's not one single part of me that my heart don't include
'Cause all of me belongs to you
[Verse]
Fingers claw the darkness in my dream
Searching for a love I lost but can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
There's not one single part of me that my heart don't include
'Cause all of me belongs to you
All of me belongs to you
