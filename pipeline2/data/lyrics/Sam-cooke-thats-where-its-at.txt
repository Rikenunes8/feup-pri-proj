[Verse 1]
Lights turned way down low
And music soft and slow
With someone you love so
That's where it's at, yeah
Your world turned upside down
You're making not a sound
No one else around
That's where it's at, yeah
Let me tell you
Your heart beatin' fast
You're knowin' that time will pass
But hopin' that it lasts
That's where it's at, oh yeah
[Chorus]
That's where it's at, pretty baby, ha ha
That's where it's at, oh yes it is
That's where it's at, pretty baby, mmm
That's where it's at, oh yeah, oh yeah
And oh yeah, and oh yeah
[Verse 2]
Let me tell you just one thing
To say it's time to go
And she says "Yes, I know"
But just stay one minute more
That's where it's at
Oh, let me say it one more time
[Outro]
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, I know that's where it's at
That's where it's at, pretty baby, ha ha
That's where it's at
