[Zack de la Rocha]
Talkin' about the American Indian movement
Well in 1977, after a series of long struggles against the BIA
Get that spotlight out of my fuckin' eye, man
Get that thing off
Talkin' to people I can't even see 'em
In 1977, after a long series of struggles
The Oglala Sioux reservation was under attack by the FBI
People who were involved in the movement there
Involved in defending their culture, defending their freedom
Were bein' taken away, were bein' kidnapped
Were bein' murdered and one man
Who happened to be one of the leaders of AIM
Was thrown in jail
He has sat there for 17 years for crimes he did not commit
His name is Leonard Peltier, and this brother's been in jail
And has served his people, and has served true freedom
And constitutional rights and is being denied his own
And I think it's a hypocrisy all of us need to expose in this country
So that if we wanna raise our voice
For ourselves in America the same doesn't happen
We've got, we've got some pamphlets in the back
Where we're sellin' some shirts
Please pick one up, and please send, please, send
Your name or there's an address you can send or what's his name
Fuckin' Dixey Crack Clinton, whoever that fuckin' punk is
Let's fill this punk's room full of fuckin' mail
I know it's not the fuckin' most powerful form of fuckin' change But let's get this fuckin' ball rollin' all right
This song is called "Bombtrack"
One time for ya fuckin' mind, Minnesota
Check this shit out
Yeah, it goes a-1, 2, 3
[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just another bombtrack and suckers be thinkin' that they can fade this
But, I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold run a train on punk ho's, that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge, and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall, and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views, that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, and then watch 'em burn
[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite
And then watch 'em burn
[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn[Verse 2]
It goes a
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after mothafuckin hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite
And then watch 'em burn
[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
