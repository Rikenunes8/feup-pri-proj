This is where i've left my friends
Some are real and some pretend
All of you, you knew me well
'cause i've never ever been
This strong
Now i know
Now i'm strong
I don't want it
Unless you've got a lot for me
When you wanted
To breathe
Through me
To be
Through me
Desire me
[?]
Desire me
[?]
Right through you
