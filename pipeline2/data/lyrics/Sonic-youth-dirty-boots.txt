[Verse 1]
Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls, they're playing on 
a jelly roll
Time to take a ride, time to take it in a midnight eye
And if you wanna go, get on below
[Chorus 1]
Pinking out the day
Dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love
It's all above
[Verse 2]
Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck
[Chorus]
Time to rock the road
And tell the story of the jelly rolling
Dirty boots are on
Hi di ho
[Chorus 2]
Pinking out the black
Dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue
Now it's undone
[Vocal Outro]
I got some dirty boots
Yeah, dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby
Dirty boots
Hey
[Instrumental Outro]
