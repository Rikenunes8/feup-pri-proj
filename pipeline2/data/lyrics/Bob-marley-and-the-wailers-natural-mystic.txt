[Chorus]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
[Verse 1]
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie
[Verse 2]
One and all got to face reality now
Though I've tried to find the answer to all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible to go living through the past
Don't tell no lie
[Chorus]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
[Bridge]
Such a natural mystic, blowing through the air
[Verse 3]
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why
[Chorus]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie
If you listen carefully now you will hear
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
[Outro]
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
