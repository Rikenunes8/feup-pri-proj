Say lonely child
Say all the while
Say morning child
In the morning child
Do you want me child
Do you want me child
Do you want me child
And i know you wear the high
I owe you the morning
And i need all you all the summers in the sand
And high we walk when we begin to crawl
And i say child, will you never make it know
Baby sweet, you on and on
And it's suddenly
Bono: "not too many words."
Yeah, not again
Bono: "is this the chorus?"
And you walk along...
And you're walking
And it changes
Bono: "that's good, hold it now."
Baby, sweet talking baby
Around...don't turn around and sing
Don't turn around
We suffer in the sand
Don't turn your back
When the same is in your song
Caledonia
Bono: [laughs] "something?"
Bono: "what's the verse, again?"Lonely, and you choose your heart
And you're weaving
Don't turn around
Turn around again
Bono: "this is the chorous, yeah."
On wilderland
Don't turn around
The sun ain't gonna shine
We no more day be gone
I want you now
I need you now
Like the curls on the trees and the ohhhh child
Why...love...you want me child
You want a chance, you wanna
But you can't
I need you girl
Don't turn around
Don't turn around no more
Don't turn around, baby see me more
Don't turn around, the sun again is sing you home
So, caledonia
Caledonia, caledoniaDon't turn around
Don't turn around
Don't turn around...
[a second of silence]
Bono: "try not to do that again
