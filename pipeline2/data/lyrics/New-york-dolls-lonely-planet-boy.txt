[Intro]
Huh
Oh, it's hard
It's so hard
[Chorus 1]
And it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from from the other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', baby, for your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
[Verse 1]
Oh, you pick me up
You're out a-drivin' in your car
When I tell you where I'm goin'
You're always tellin' me it's too far
[Verse 2]
But how could you be drivin'
Down by my home
When y'know, I ain't got one
And I'm, I'm so all alone
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
[Chorus 2]
Oh, it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', I'm cryin', baby, for your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
[Interlude]
Oh, it's so lonely
Oh, oh
[Instrumental Bridge][Verse 3]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh, can't you hear me callin'
I'm a thousand miles away
And I don't wanna stay
I'm thinkin' words I gotta say
[Verse 4]
'Cause I wanna be there witcha
And I know what to bring
I remember from the days
You got over everything
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
[Chorus 3]
Oh, it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', I'm cryin'
Can't y'see I'm dyin'
Baby, for your love
[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeahNow you are lonely
