I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls
 and water ice
Tables of paper wood, windows of light
And everything emptying into white
A simple garden, with acres of sky
A brown-haired dog-mouse if one dropped by
Yellow Delanie
 would sleep well at night
With everything emptying into white
A sad blue eyed drummer rehearses outside
A black spider dancing on top of his eye
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike
And everything emptying into white
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice
And everything emptying into white
