[Verse 1]
I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free
[Chorus]
Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you, yeah
She said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly
[Verse 2]
Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
It wanted to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it
You see, I find it
A bit stimulating
But after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife
Hey, can you still boogie
Boogie down the road sometime
[Chorus]
Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
You were trying to put me down
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song, I'm dancin' on
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mystery man, what's going downThat young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you loved me, baby?
How come you loved me
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
You tried to have them shackle me
Bring me in
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Her lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home
Tried to take my life
Not my child too
Tryina upset my woman
Examinin' my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Asked the Lord to help
Wish he was in a position
To upset the judge[Chorus]
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand
