[Verse 1]
I'm on the white cliffs of Dover
Thinking it over and over
But if I jump, it's all over
A cautionary tale for you
[Verse 2]
I'd like to roll in the clover
With you over and over
On the white cliffs of Dover
And then I'd let you push me over
[Chorus]
If that is the fact, then in actual fact
It's not where it's at, and it's over, oh-oh
If that is the fact, then in actual fact
I'm not where it's at, it's all over (Yes, it is)
[Verse 3]
And now the bluebirds are over
(I floated away)
Over the white cliffs of Dover
(Spent twenty years upon the sea)
And when you push me over
(And when I came back)
Don't bury me, I'm not worth anything
(I found that you turned into me)ï»¿[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
[Chorus]
If that is the fact, then in actual fact
It's not where it's at, and it's over, oh-oh
If that is the fact, then in actual fact
I'm not where it's at, it's all over (Yes, it is)
[Outro]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
