[Verse 1]
September '77
Port Elizabeth weather fine
It was business as usual
In police room 619
[Chorus]
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko
Yihla moja, yihla moja
The man is dead
The man is dead
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
When I try and sleep at night
I can only dream in red
The outside world is black and white
With only one colour dead
[Chorus]
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko
Yihla moja, yihla moja
The man is dead
The man is dead
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
You can blow out a candle
But you can't blow out a fire
Once the flames begin to catch
The wind will blow it higher
[Chorus]
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko
Yihla moja, yihla moja
The man is dead
The man is dead[Post-Chorus]
And the eyes of the world are
Watching now, watching now
