Uptown, going down, old life line
Walking down faster
Walking with the master of time
My lady woke up and she broke down
She got up, she let go
Take me Timer, shake me Timer
Timer let it blow
Let it blow
My darling friends
Oh, I belong to Timer
He changed my face
You're a fine, a fine one Timer
You've got me walking through the gates of space
I keep remembering
Indoors that I used to walk through
Baby, I'm not trying to talk you down
But I could walk through them doors
Onto a pleasure ground
It was sweet and funny
A pleasure ground
Didn't know about money
Didn't know about Timer
Did not know about Timer
Holding to my cradle at the start (holding to my cradle, my cradle)
But now my hand is open (now the hand is open)
And now my hand is ready for my heart
(So let the wind blow)
So let the wind blow Timer
Let the wind blow Timer (I like her song)
And if the song goes minor
I won't mind (I never minded)
And Timer knows the lady's gonna love again (you know)
Timer says the lady rambles never more
If you love me true
And if you love me true
I'll spend my life with you
You and Timer
You're a jigsaw Timer, you're a
God is a jigsaw (a jigsaw timer)
God is a jigsaw
Jigsaw timer, you're a
God is a jigsaw timer
God is a jigsaw
Timer (souling with)
Timer (souling with)
Timer (souling with)
Timer
Oh let it blow, yeah uh huh
Let it blow uh huh
Timer, uh huh
Timer, uh huh
Timer, uh huh
Timer, uh huh
Timer, uh huh
Timer, uh huh...
