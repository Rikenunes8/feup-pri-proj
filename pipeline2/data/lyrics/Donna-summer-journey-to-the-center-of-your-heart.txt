[Chorus]
Take me on a journey
On a journey to the center of your heart
Let me make the journey
Wanna journey to the center of your heart
I wanna go, I wanna go
Oh let me go, I wanna go
[Bridge]
Baby wanna travel
Wanna travel 'cross the borders of your mind
Baby wanna travel
Wanna travel 'cross the borders of your mind
I wanna go, please let me go
I wanna go, please let me go
[Hook]
Take me on a journey
On a journey to the bottom of your soul
Take me on a journey
On a journey to the bottom of your soul
I wanna go, oh let me go
I wanna go, oh let me go
[Interlude]
Baby wanna travel
Wanna travel 'cross the borders of your mind
Baby wanna travel
Wanna travel 'cross the borders of your mind
I wanna go, oh let me go
I wanna go, oh let me go
[Chorus]
