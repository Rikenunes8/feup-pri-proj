[Verse 1]
Did you find the boy
You meant to destroy?
Did you feel him?
Did you span the world
For the red-eyed girl?
Did you feel her?
Well, makes me swamped
Yeah, makes me sweat
Did you hear her?
And maybe she cries
In the middle of the night
Did you feel her?
Hey!
[Chorus]
Modern things don't die, just stain
Modern things don't die, just stain
[Verse 2]
Well, say you feel nice
To break the ice
I'm ready
Now say the word
I never heard
I'm ready
Well, makes me strong
Yeah, makes me fight
When I hear her
And maybe she cries
In the middle of the night
Do you feel her?
[Bridge]
Try me out
Find what I'm all about
And we can make some noise
Not like the other boys
[Chorus]
Modern things don't die, just stain
Modern things don't die, just stain
Modern things don't die, just stain
Modern things don't die, just stain[Verse 3]
Did you find a boy
You meant to destroy?
Did you heal him?
Did you span the world
For the red-eyed girl?
Did you feel her?
Well, makes me strong
Yeah, makes me fight
Do you hear her?
And maybe she calls
In the middle of the night
Do you feel her?
Hey!
[Bridge]
Try me out
Find what I'm all about
And we can make some noise
Not like the other boys
And you can hold me tight
Yeah, on a motorbike
Yeah, we could make some noise
Yeah, we could do this right
Hey!Modern things
Modern things
Modern things
Yeah, modern things
