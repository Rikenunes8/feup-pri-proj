[Verse 1]
Well, it was out in California by the San Diego sea
That was when I was taken in, and it left its mark on me
Yeah, she nearly drove me crazy with all those China toys
And I know she really didn't mean a thing to any of those sailor boys
[Chorus 1]
Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
Baby, I'm noticing the change as I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge
[Verse 2]
South Carolina put out its arms for me
Right up until everything went black somewhere on Lonely Street
And I still can't quite remember who helped me to my feet
Thank God for the longneck bottle the angel's remedy
[Chorus 2]
Louisiana rain is falling just like tears
Running down my face, washing out the years
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge
[Guitar Solo]
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 3]
Well, I never will get over this English refugee
Singing to the jukebox in some all-night beanery
Yeah he was eating pills like candy and chasing them with tea
You should have seen him lick his lips at 
old black Molly B
[Chorus 1]
Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
Baby I'm noticing the change as I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge[Chorus 2]
Louisiana rain is falling just like tears
Running down my face, washing out the years
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge
