Oo la, la, la, oo la, la, la, la
Emily and her love to be, carved in a heart on a berry tree
But it's only a little farewell love spell, time to design a woman
Touch me, oh wake me, Emily you ornament the earth for me
Emily, you're the natural snow, the unstudied sea, you're a cameo
And I swear you were born a weavers lover, born for the loom's desire
Move me, oh sway me. Emily, the ornament, the earth for me
Emmie, your Momma's been calling you
Who stole Mama's heart and cuddled in her garden?
Darling Emmie, la, la, la, oo la, la la
You're my friend and I loved you, Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
She got the way to move me, Emmie. She got the way to move me, yeah
She got the way to move me, Emmie. She got the way to move me, get up and move me...
