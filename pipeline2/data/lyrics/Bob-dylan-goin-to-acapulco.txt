[Verse 1]
I'm going down to Rose Marie's
She never does me wrong
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song
It's a wicked life but what the hell
Everybody's got to eat
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratching for my meat
[Chorus]
Going to Acapulco, going on the run
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun
Yeah, going to have some fun
[Verse 2]
Now, whenever I get up
And I can't find what I need
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And get something quick to eat
It's not a bad way to make a living
And I ain't complainin' none
Oh, I can pull my plum, and drink my rum
And then go on home and have my fun
[Chorus]
Going to Acapulco, going on the run
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun
Yeah, going to have some fun
[Verse 3]
Now, if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks
Well, every time you know when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waitin' for me to come
[Chorus]
Going to Acapulco, going on the run
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun
Yeah, going to have some fun
