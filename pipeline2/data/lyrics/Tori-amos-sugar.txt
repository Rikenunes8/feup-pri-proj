[Verse 1]
Don't say morning's come
Don't say it's up to me
If I could take twenty-five minutes
Out of the record books
[Chorus]
Sugar, he brings me sugar
[Verse 2]
Bobby's collecting bees
And hammers, he used one on me
Cold war with little boys
Get in with a bubblegum trade
[Chorus]
And sugar, bring me sugar
I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, he brings me sugar
As far as I can tell
I've been gone for miles now
[Bridge]
And you know and I know
I don't know me very well
And I know and you know
If they found me out...
[Chorus]
Sugar, he brings me sugar
I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, he brings me sugar
I know the robins bring
They bring many things but
[Outro]
Sugar, oh, sugar
Sugar, sugar
Sugar, you...
