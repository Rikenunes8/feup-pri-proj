[Intro]
Well, Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawdy miss Clawdy
Girl, you sure look good to me
But please don't excite me baby
I know it can't be me
[Verse 1]
'Cause I give you all of my money
Yeah, but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night
[Bridge]
I'm going to tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear ,girl, what you've been doing to me
I'm going to tell everybody that I'm down in misery
[Verse 2]
So, bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be coming no more
Goodbye, little darling, down the road I'll go
So, bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be coming no more
Goodbye, little darling, down the road I'll go
