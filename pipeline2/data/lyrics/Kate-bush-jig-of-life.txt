[Verse 1]
Hello, old lady
I know your face well
I know it well, she says
"Ooh, na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
I'll be sitting in your mirror
Now is the place where the crossroads meet
Will you look into the future?"
[Chorus]
"Never, never say goodbye
To my part of your life."
No, no, no, no-no
Oh, let me live
She said, "C'mon and let me live, girl,"
She said, "C'mon and let me live, girl,"
(C'mon and let me live)
[Verse 2]
"This moment in time,"
She said
"It doesn't belong to you,"
She said
"It belongs to me
And to your little boy and to your little girl
And the one hand clapping
Where on your palm is my little line
When you're written in mine
As an old memory?"
Ooh, na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-nâ€”[Chorus]
"Never, never say goodbye
To my part of your life
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh, never, never, never, never, never let me go,"
She said, "C'mon and let me live, girl,"
(C'mon and let me live!)
She said, "C'mon and let me live, girl,"
(C'mon and let me live)
[Breakdown]
[Bridge: Kate Bush & 
John Carder Bush
]
I put this moment here
I put this moment here
I put this moment
Over here!
Over here!
[Outro: John Carder Bush]
Can't you see where memories are kept bright?
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl
Time in her eyes is spawning past life
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled
Holding 
all the love
 that waits for you here
Catch us now for I am your future
A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land
Come over here to where When lingers
Waiting in this empty world
Waiting for Then, when the life spray cools
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools
We are of the going water and the gone
We are of water in the holy land of water
And all that's to come runs in
With the thrust on the strand
