[Verse 1]
Driving along you can see all the people
Who seem to have nothing to say to each other
Each day they grow farther and farther away from each other
[Verse 2]
Driving along you can spot all the problems
On faces so tired of facing each other
Each day they grow farther and farther away from each other
[Bridge]
Driving along at fifty seven thousand miles an hour
Look at those people standing on the petals of a flower
Look at those petals pumping for a little bit of power
[Verse 3]
Driving along you can see all the people
Who seem to have nothing to say to each other
Each day they grow farther and farther away from each other
[Outro]
They seem to say nothing
They seem to go nowhere
They seem to go farther
They seem to go nowhere
They seem to go farther
They seem to go nowhere
They seem to go farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther and farther
And farther away from each other
