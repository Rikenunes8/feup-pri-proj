Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Hear the sea spray give
I was with her
We're under the ship so get me over
Now that was me
Listen
Now she fishes now
Listen
There was no one out there we used
There is the news for me useless
Now so much waste
How we'll be teased
Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Oh won't you just ask me
You're an imbecile
What's the matter for everyone I feel
Pain blues singer
He's playing just a guitar
From the top
I wake I still look I feel loose
We're all here now who's the first
Ease into my heart
He must be one of us
Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
