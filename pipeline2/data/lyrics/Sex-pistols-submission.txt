[Verse 1: Johnny Rotten]
I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I picked you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
Submission
Going down, down, dragging me down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found
[Verse 2: Johnny Rotten]
You've got me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in heaven above
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
Submission
Going down, down, dragging me down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found
[Post-Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
For there's a mystery
Under the sea, under a water
Come share it
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
Submission
Going down, down, dragging me down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found
[Post-Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
'Cos it's a secret
Under the water, under the sea
Octopus Rock[Verse 2: Johnny Rotten]
You've got me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in heaven above
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
Submission
Going down, down, dragging me down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found
[Outro: Johnny Rotten]
Submission
Submission
Going down, down, under the sea
I wanna drown, drown, under the water
Going down, down, under the sea
