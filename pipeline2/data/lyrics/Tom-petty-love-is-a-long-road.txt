[Verse 1]
There was a girl I knew
She said she cared about me
She tried to make my world
The way she thought it should be
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we were desperate then
To have each other to hold
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road
[Verse 2]
There were so many times
I would wake up at noon
Yeah, with my head spinning 'round
I would wait for the moon
[Chorus 2]
And give her one more chance
To try and save my soul
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road
[Verse 3]
Yeah, it was hard to give up
Some things are hard to let go
Some things are never enough
I guess I only can hope
[Chorus 3]
For maybe one more chance
To try and save my soul
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road
[Outro]
Love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road
