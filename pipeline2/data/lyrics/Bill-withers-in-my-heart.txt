[Verse 1]
When I need some affection, you're not there
I close my eyes and use my recollection
And in one moment there's my favorite scene
Taken from the place where I keep my dreams
[Chorus]
In my heart
In my heart
[Verse 2]
It's a lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely thing to see
The picture in the birthday wallet that you gave to me
But a man can lose a photograph, so just in case
I keep your portrait close to me in a special place
[Chorus]
In my heart
In my heart
[Outro]
In my heart, in my heart
In my heart
Hey, hey, in my heart
In my heart
Hey
