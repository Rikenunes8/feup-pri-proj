[Verse 1]
A single rose in your garden dwells
Like any rose it's not itself
It is my love in your garden grows
But let's pretend it's just a rose
[Chorus]
Well, I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you
[Verse 2]
Do not listen to my song
Don't remember it, don't sing along
Let's pretend it's a work of art
Let's pretend it's not my heart
[Chorus]
Well, I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you
[Verse 3]
The rose will fade when summer's gone
The song will fade and I'll be gone
Because my heart is dying too
And it's all the same to you
[Chorus]
Well, I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you
Well, I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you
