There's a man on the corner
Got his head in his hat
He dances like a gypsy
So he must be where it's at
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
The wind is the thing
That makes the body swing
It brings you up and takes you down
And treats you like a king
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Met a little Momma
She was sweet, she was gone
She's got legs like a railroad
Face like a song
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock, oh yeah
Wind is in the willows
My house is up a tree
The seas of change are flowing
I want everybody free
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Met a little Momma
She was sweet, she was gone
She's got legs like a railroad
Face like a songDo the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Ally bally bash bam rock-a-billy boom
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock, oh yeah
Let it all hang out everybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock, oh yeah
Ally bally bash bam rock-a-billy boom
