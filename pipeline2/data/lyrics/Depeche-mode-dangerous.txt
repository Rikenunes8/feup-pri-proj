[Verse 1]
The things you do aren't good for my health
The moves you make you make for yourself
The means you use aren't meant to confuse
Although they do, they're the ones that I would choose
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wouldn't want it any other way
You wouldn't let me anyway
[Chorus]
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
[Verse 2]
The lies you tell aren't meant to deceive
They're not there for me to believe
I've heard your vicious words
You know by now it takes a lot to see me hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
And I couldn't take it any other way
But there's a price I have to pay
[Chorus]
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous[Chorus]
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for...
