[Verse 1: Whitney Houston]
Like a candle burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do
[Verse 2: Jermaine Jackson]
Like a leaf upon the wind
I could find no place to land
I dreamed the hours away
And wondered everyday
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do
[Chorus: Whitney Houston & Jermaine Jackson]
What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
You've touched my heart in places that I never even knew
'Cause nobody loves me like you do
[Verse 3: Jermaine Jackson & 
Whitney Houston
]
I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's you
Baby, nobody loves me like you do
[Chorus: Whitney Houston & Jermaine Jackson]
What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
You've touched my heart in places that I never even knew
Nobody loves me (Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me (Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do
