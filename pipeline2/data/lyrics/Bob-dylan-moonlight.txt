[Verse 1]
The seasons they are turnin'
And my sad heart is yearnin'
To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
[Verse 2]
The dusky light, the day is losing
Orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
[Verse 3]
The air is thick and heavy
All along the levy
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
[Bridge]
Well, I’m preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
I'll take you 'cross the river dear
You've no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like
[Verse 4]
The clouds are turning crimson
The leaves fall from the limbs and
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
[Verse 5]
The boulevards of cypress trees
The masquerade of birds and bees
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?[Bridge]
The trailing moss and mystic glow
The purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me
[Verse 6]
My pulse is running through my palm
The sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
