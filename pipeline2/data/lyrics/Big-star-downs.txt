Think downs
Things sinkin' with a melody
Someone's gonna ask if you graduated
But as for you
Throw downs
Isolated as far as you go
I'm well versed and the walls are worst
And the windows are most
Wind downs
A.C
Coast to coast
High cool 'cept when I lie with you
Naked on a sudden low
Oh, cool downs
Cool downs
Wise and prosperous
That I am
Flustered and erratic
'Cept when I lie with you
Naked on a sudden low
Give downs
Live downs
Lie downs
Any downs at all
Any downs at all
