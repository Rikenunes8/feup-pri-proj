[Verse 1]
He's there in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
[Chorus]
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
He's there in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's there in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
[Chorus]
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
[Verse 3]
He's there in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's there in case I want it all
He's there 'cause I want
[Chorus]
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
