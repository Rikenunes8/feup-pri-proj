[Verse 1]
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby
Just want to let them roll
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy
I'll tell you why
I got a woman who can take me there
The apple of my eye
[Chorus 1]
Oh, whoa, I just don't know
No no, no, no
No, whoa, I love her so
[Verse 2]
Don't let me see that mornin' paper
'Cause I don't need those dues
It's just the same old murder movie
But they call it the news
I'll tell you what would be some story
And what would set me free
Is if the same thing happened to everybody
That just happened to me
[Chorus 2]
Oh, whoa, I just don't know
No no, no, no
No, whoa, I'll never let her go
No no, no
[Verse 3]
And every time I hear somebody
Sneaking up behind
Whoa, I turn around but I still hear that sound
And just when I'm about to lose my mind
[Chorus 3]
Here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way
Down along that devastation trail
Well, tell the Lord above
She's got a brand of love that cannot fail[Verse 4]
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
And that's no lie
I'm hanging on to my special friend
The apple of my eye
The apple of my eye, my inspiration too
She's got a lead on my heart and my soul
And she knows just what to do
[Chorus 3]
Oh, whoa, I just don't know
No no, no, no
No, whoa, I get so low and my mind's about to go
[Chorus 4]
But wait a minute, here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way
Down along that devastation trail
Well, let the fires burn
And let the floods return, we will prevail
[Outro]
Hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
