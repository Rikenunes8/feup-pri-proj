[Verse 1]
I like all the different people
I like sticky everywhere
Look around, you bet I'll be there!
Hot metal in the sun
Pony in the air
Sooey and saints at the fair
[Verse 2]
Saints alive, you're saying
Walk in squares
The hid are out
Out for the year
It's a lot of face
A lot of crank air
Eroding, round here
[Hook]
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
[Verse 3]
I like all the different people
I like every kind of fair
In the crowd, you bet I'll be there!
Walking around
Going nowhere
Seeing sooey and saints at the fair
[Hook]
Summer is ready when you are
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
(Summer's ready)
Summer is ready when you are
It's a lot of face
Crank air
Walk in squares
In the sunSummer is ready when you are
