Oh, hey brah, how we doin' man?
Alright
It's been a while man, life's so rad
This band's my favorite man, don't ya love 'em?

Aw man, you want a beer?
Alright

This is great, man

Hey, did you know about the party after the show?
Yeah
Aw man, it's gonna be the best, I'm so stoked
Take it easy, brah
[Verse 1]
I'm me, me be, goddamn, I am
I can sing and hear me, know me
[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away
[Spoken Word: Mykel Allen & 
Karl Koch

Hey, what's up?
Not much
Um, did you hear about the party?
Yeah
I think I'm gonna go but, um, my friends don't really wanna go
Could I get a ride?
[Verse 2]
Oh no, it go, it gone, bye-bye (Bye)
Who I? I think, I sink, and I die
[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone
[Outro]
(I don't want to destroy your tank top)
If you want to destroy my sweater
(Let's be friends and just walk away)
Hold this thread as I walk away
(Good to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone
[Instrumental Outro]
