[Verse 1]
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet little agony
I don't know just where you've been
But I'll take, take, take
All that you have for me, in sin
Where are we going?
[Chorus]
And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change
[Verse 2]
And the sad, sad, sad
All the sad faces drown, in this town
Where are we going?
[Chorus]
And they all want you to change
(Where are we going?)
And they all want you to change
(Where are we going?)
