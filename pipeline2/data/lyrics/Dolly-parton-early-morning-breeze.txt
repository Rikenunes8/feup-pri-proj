[Verse 1]
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadowlark is singing in the trees
In the meadow, I go walking in the early morning breeze
[Verse 2]
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of a flower growing wild
Freeing it, I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
[Chorus]
Rainbow-colored flowers, kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and the wild geranium
Drops of morning dew still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
[Verse 3]
Misty-eyed, I look about the meadow where I stray
For it's there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers, I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze
[Chorus]
A rainbow-colored meadow, kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and the wild geranium
Drops of morning dew still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
