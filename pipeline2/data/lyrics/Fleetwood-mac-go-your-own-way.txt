[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?
[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac and Lindsey Buckingham]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
[Verse 2: Lindsey Buckingham]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you
[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
[Solo 1]
[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
[Solo 2]
[Outro: Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
