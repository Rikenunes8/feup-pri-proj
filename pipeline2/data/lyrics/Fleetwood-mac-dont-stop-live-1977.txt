[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way
[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do
[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yеsterday's gone
[Verse 3: Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takеs just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you
[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone[Outro: Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Christine McVie]
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, no, don't you look back
