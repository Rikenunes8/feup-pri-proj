[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking the words of wisdom, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah-ha, yeah
And in my hour of darkness
She is a-standing right in front of me
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Lord, let it be
[Chorus]
Yeah, let it be, oh, let it be
Lord, let it be, Lord, let it be, ah-ha
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah
[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah-ha
And though they may be parted
There is a-still a chance that they might see
There will be an answer, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah
[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Lord, let it be, Lord, let it be, ah-ha
There will be an answer, let it be
Lord, let it be, let it be, ah
Let it be, let it be
