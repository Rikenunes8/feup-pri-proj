[Verse 1]
You be my baby
Don't give me no maybe
I never, never make you cry
You be my honey
Give you all my money
I will till the day I die
[Chorus]
Because I 
never, never, never felt such a thrill
And I 
never, never, never felt this way until
Whoa, 
kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, can I get my bill?
[Bridge]
You've set my world
Come closer, girl
You'll be my lover
There's no one above ya
I want everyone to know
You look so tasty
Like quick cream pastry
Never, never let you go
[Chorus]
Because I 
always, always, always want you by my side
Always, always, always to keep you satisfied
You know 
wanna, wanna, want to make you be my bride
Once you name the day, marry right away
[Bridge]
You know you please me
Don't ever leave me
I always want you near
You know I need you
Come, let me lead you
And make all your troubles disappear
[Chorus]
Because 
I love you, love you, love you every day
Pet you, pet you, pet you in my own way
You won't 
ever, ever, ever need to go astray
You understand, am I your man?[Outro]
Yeah baby, you know it's alright
Come on, baby, and love me tonight
Whoa baby, I wanna talk to you
I need you, baby, to see me through
