[Verse 1]
Well, I know a thing about contrition
Because I got enough to spare
And I'll be granting your permission
'Cause you haven't got a prayer
Well, I said hey, hallelujah
I'm gonna, come on, sing the praise
And let the spirit come on through you
We got innocence for days
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I think I'm gonna burn in Hell
Everybody burn the house right down
[Chorus]
And say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, 
take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave, yeah, go
[Post-Chorus]
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
[Verse 2]
You play ring around the ambulance
Like you never gave a care
So get the choir boys around you
It's a compliment, I swear
And I said ashes to ashes, we all fall down
I wanna hear you sing the praise
I said ashes to ashes, we all fall down
We got innocence for days
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I think I'm gonna burn in Hell
Everybody burn the house right down[Chorus]
And say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave, yeah
[Bridge]
You better run like the devil 'cause they're never gonna leave you alone
You better hide up in the alley 'cause they're never gonna find you a home
And as the blood runs down the walls (Blood runs down the wall)
You see me creeping up these halls (Creeping up these halls)
I've been a bad motherfucker, tell your sister I'm another
Go, go, go
[Chorus]
And I said, say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man[Outro]
So get up
So get out
S-I-N, I S-I-N
