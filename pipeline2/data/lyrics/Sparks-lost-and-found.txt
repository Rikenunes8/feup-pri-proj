[Chorus]
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
[Verse 1]
And all the streets are paved tonight
And we won't be their slaves tonight
And I ain't gonna feel bad at all, feel bad at all
[Chorus]
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
[Verse 2]
He's Robin Hood by accident
I need it more than he does and
I surely will not feel bad at all, feel bad at all
Feel bad at all, feel bad at all
Feel bad at all, feel bad at all
[Chorus]
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
[Bridge]
Oh is there anybody out there by the name of Mister Jones?
No? No? Well, I tried
Lost and found, lost and found, lost and found, lost and found
[Chorus]
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Lost and found
A wallet from a man, careless man, careless man[Verse 3]
We sailed upon a bubbly sea
With Nina, Pinta, and Marie
And none of us will feel bad at all, feel bad at all
Feel bad at all, feel bad at all
Feel bad at all, feel bad at all
[Verse 4]
Yes, all the streets are paved tonight
And we won't be their slaves tonight
And I ain't gonna feel bad at all, feel bad at all
[Outro]
Lost and found
Lost and found
Lost and found
Lost and found
