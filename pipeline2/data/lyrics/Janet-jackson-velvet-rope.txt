[Chorus]
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
[Spoken]
We all wanna feel special
[Verse 1]
This special need that's within us
Brings out the best, yet worst in us
Follow the passion that's within you
Living the truth will set you free
[Chorus]
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
[Verse 2]
Put others down to fill us up
Oppressing me will oppress you
Outside leave judgment, outside leave hate
One love's the answer you'll find in you
[Chorus]
We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong (Belong, belong)
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope[Violin Solo]
[Chorus]
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
