[Verse 1]
Jonathan
, 
call again
Take me to Coney Island
Take me on the train
Kiss me while 
I calculate
And calibrate
 
and heaven's sakes
Don't make me explain
[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
[Verse 2]
Jonathan, anything
And anyone you have done
Has gotta be alright with me
If she's part of the reason
You are how you are
She's alright with me
[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
[Bridge]
You'd like to captain a capsized ship
But I like watching you live
You'd like to captain a capsized ship
But I like watching you live
[Verse 3]
Jonathan
, 
call again
Take me to Coney Island
Take me on the train
Kiss me while 
I calculate
And calibrate
 
and heaven's sakes
Don't make me explain[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
