[Verse 1]
Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night, babe, and I'm feeling' fine
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up
Have a ball tonight
[Verse 2]
Well, I got me a date and I won't be late
I picked her up in my '88'
Shag on down to the social hall
When the music starts jumpin', I'll have a ball
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna rip it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up
And ball tonight
[Verse 3]
Along about ten I'll be flying high
I'll walk on out into open sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up
Have a ball tonight[Verse 1]
Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night, babe, and I'm feeling' fine
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up
And a ball tonight
