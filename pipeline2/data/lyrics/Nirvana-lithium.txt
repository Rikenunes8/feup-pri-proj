[Verse 1]
I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you, broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care, and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head,
 
and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've hurt, but I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there, and I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah[Bridge]
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
[Verse 1]
I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you, broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care, and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
[Outro]
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
