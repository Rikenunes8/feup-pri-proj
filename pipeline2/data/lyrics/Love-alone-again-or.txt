[Verse 1]
Yeah
Said, it's all right
I won't forget
All the times I've waited patiently for you
And you'll do just what you choose to do
And I will be alone again tonight my dear
[Verse 2]
Yeah
I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone
I think that people are the greatest fun"
And I will be alone again tonight my dear
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
Yeah
I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone
I think that people are the greatest fun"
And I will be alone again tonight my dear
