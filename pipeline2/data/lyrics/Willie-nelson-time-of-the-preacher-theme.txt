But he could not forgive her
Though he tried and tried and tried
And the halls of his memory
Still echo her lies
And he cried like a baby
And he screamed like a panther in the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the lesson is over
And the killin's begun
