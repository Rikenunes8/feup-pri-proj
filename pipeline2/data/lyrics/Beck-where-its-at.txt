[Verse 1]
There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans, just clap your hands
Just clap your hands
[Chorus]
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
[Interlude]
(Take me home with my elevator bones)
(
That was a good drum break
)
[Verse 2]
Pick yourself up off the side of the road
With your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones
Members only hypnotizers
Move through the room like ambulance drivers
Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
Hirsute
 with your 
parachute fruits
Passing the dutchie
 
from coast to coast
Let the man Gary Wilson 
rock the most[Chorus]
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
[Interlude]
("What about those who swing both ways? AC-DC's?")
(Let's make it out, baby)
Cheese
[Bridge]
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone 
(We're all part of the total scene)
[Chorus]
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
[Interlude]
Oh, dear me, Make Out City's a two-horse town
That's beautiful, dad
Got my microphone[Verse 3]
There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
Jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans, just clap your hands
Just clap your hands
[Chorus]
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
[Interlude]
I got plastic on my mind
Make it out, baby
Let's make it
Let's make it out, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
It's all good
All good
It's very good
