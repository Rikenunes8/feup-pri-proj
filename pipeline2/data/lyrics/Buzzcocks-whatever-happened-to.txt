[Chorus 1]
Whatever happened to twin sets? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to hi-fi? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to TV sex? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to you and I? (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 1]
Your passion is a product of highlight and detail
That come hither, look, bonus offer retail
[Chorus 2]
Whatever happened to pickup trucks? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to yellow pages? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to burning books? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to new ages? (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 2]
Your emotions are cheap, cut, price, cash, and carry
You wear your heart on your sleeve for any Tom, Dick or Harry
[Hook]
Your love is a cashed in check
Oh, oh, that's the way of all flesh
[Chorus 3]
Whatever happened to Chairman Mao?
 (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to God above? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to the cow? (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever happened to plug-in love? (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 3]
Your pasteurized life, so fit for consumption
Ooh, those undressing eyes, so strictly commercial
[Hook]
Your love is a cashed in check
Oh, oh, that's the way of all flesh
[Outro]
All flesh, all flesh
