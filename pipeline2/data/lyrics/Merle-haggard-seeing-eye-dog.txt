[Verse]
Well, I'm gonna get me a seeing eye dog to help me find my way
I'm so much in love with you, I can't even see the light of day
My mind is cloudy like a winter storm before the rain come pouring down
I feel so good and I got to get my feet on the ground
On the ground
[Verse]
Well, I'm walking real tall with my head held high in a cloud
I feel so good sometimes I want to holler out loud
Well I'm gonna take me a calm-me-down pill every time you come around
I feel so good and I got to get my feet on the ground
On the ground
[Verse]
Well, I'm walking real tall with my head held high in a cloud
I feel so good sometimes I want to holler out loud
Well I'm gonna take me a calm-me-down pill every time you come around
I feel so good and I got to get my feet on the ground
On the ground
On the ground
