[Verse 1]
Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
[Chorus]
I don't wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
[Verse 2]
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
[Verse 3]
Baby, let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
[Chorus]
I don't wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
[Verse 2]
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bearOh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
I just wanna be your teddy bear (whoo)
