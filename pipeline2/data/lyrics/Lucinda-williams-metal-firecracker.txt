[Verse 1]
Once we rode together
In a metal firecracker
You told me I was your queen
You told me I was your biker
You told me I was your everything
[Verse 2]
Once I was in your blood
And you were obsessed with me
You wanted to paint my picture
You wanted to undress me
You wanted to see me in your future
[Chorus]
All I ask
Don't tell anybody the secrets
Don't tell anybody the secrets
I told you
All I ask
Don't tell anybody the secrets
Don't tell anybody the secrets
I told you
[Verse 3]
Once you held me so tight
I thought I'd lose my mind
You said I rocked your world
You said it was for all time
You said that I would always be your girl
[Verse 4]
We'd put on ZZ Top
And turn em up real loud
I used to think you were strong
I used to think you were proud
I used to think nothing could go wrong
[Chorus]
All I ask
Don't tell anybody the secrets
Don't tell anybody the secrets
I told youAll I ask
Don't tell anybody the secrets
Don't tell anybody the secrets
I told you
