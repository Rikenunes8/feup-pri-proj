[Chorus]
She was a day tripper girl, now
She give me a one-way ticket there, y'all
It took me so, so very long, huh
I found out, I found out
I found out, I found out, children, yeah
[Verse 1]
Took me out, yes she did
And then she teased me a little bit
She told me she would love me
Teased me a little bit, y'all, huh, yeah
But I'll take the easy way out, girl, huh
I said I got a good reason now, huh
I'm gonna take the easy way out, huh
[Chorus]
She was a day tripper girl now
She give me a one-way ticket there, y'all
It was so, so very long, baby, ha
I found out, I found out
Yes I did
[Verse 2]
Listen to me, let me tell you about her
She give me a hard time
Everything about that girl is good reason, children
I'm gonna take the easy way out, y'all, huh
I said I got a good reason, girl, yeah, huh
I'm gonna take the easy way out now
[Chorus]
She was a day tripper girl, now, ha
I got a one-way ticket there girl
It took me so, so very long, y'all, huh
I found out, I found out
I found out, oh yeah
[Bridge]
Talkin' 'bout it, Lord
Listen to me
Shake it
You got it
Do it to me[Chorus]
Day tripper girl, yeah
She give me one-way ticket there, y'all
It took me so, so very long, huh
I found out, I found out
I found out, I found out
Ooh, ooh baby
[Outro]
She's a teaser, nothing but a teaser
Good teaser, nothing but a teaser now
Give me a hard time on everything I do, y'all
Give me fever, find my way out, y'all
Gotta tell you 'bout it, find my way out
Got a reason, I got a reason, children
She took me down, she didn't let me go, but, uh
Halfway, children, not halfway now
She didn't let me go all the way, y'all
