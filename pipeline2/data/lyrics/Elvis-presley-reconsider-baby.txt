[Verse 1]
Well, so long
Oh, how I hate to see you go
Yes, so long
Oh, how I hate to see you go
Well the way that I will miss you
I guess you'll never know
[Verse 2]
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
Well, I'm gonna let you go ahead on, baby
But let you come back home someday
Play the blues boys, play the blues
One more time
[Verse 3]
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby
Give yourself just a little more time
