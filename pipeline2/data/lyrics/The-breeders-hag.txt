[Verse 1]
Hag!
Coastal cut-throat!
You dirty switch!
You're on again
[Chorus]
All night, all night, all night
Under the stars
Under their light
All over the girl
Only looks bright
[Verse 2]
You're like a woman
Hag
You're just like a woman
You're on again
[Hook]
But sometimes
Under the stars
Under their light
You're everything right
You're on again
Under the stars
Under their light
All right
All right
