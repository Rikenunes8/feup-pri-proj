Ache (Silverfuck Rehearsal Demo)
Fairy tales and time in whales
Substitutes for sin
It takes some life to find the light within
Whistle past the lane lover
Whistle past the lane
Cause love's forever strange
Nestle on the moon, sunshine
Nestle on the moon
Should you hear that faint murmur
Of what love might do
Seven stars that shine
In my mind, oh my mind
I'll take you with me where I climb
In my mind, oh my mind
And if I'm wrong I'm right
I'm never gonna lose you
If I'm wrong I'm right
Take me to your life
Summertime's the only child
Summertime's the only child this night
You want to brace the golden fool
Let's make this right
Nightengales and nursery crimes
Twins that spark the charts
It takes some trust to find a trust apart
Whistle past the lane lover
Whistle past the lane
Cause love's forever strange
Nestle on the sun, starlight
Nestle on the sun
Should you hear the faint murmur
Of what love has done
Seven stars that weep
In my sleep, oh in my sleep
I'll take you with me where I keep
In my sleep, oh in my sleep
And if I'm wrong I'm right
I'm never gonna lose you
If I'm wrong I'm right
Take me to your life
All you need is you, lover
All you need is you
All you need is you, lover
So please need me too
What you need is love, stranger
What you need is love
When your love needs it's danger
Please let me through when I've got you
