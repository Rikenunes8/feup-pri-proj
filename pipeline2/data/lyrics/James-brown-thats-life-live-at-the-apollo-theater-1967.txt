It's getting late in the evening
I can't get right
I guess I did the Boogaloo and escaped
And the Funky Broadway too much last night
Yeah, I feel it, too
But I want you to know, it ain't no sin
'Cause I'm right here to do it all over again
But that's life, is what the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I guess I, I gotta change that tune
When I'm back on top, on top in June
That's life, as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
From stompin' on a dream
But I never, I never let it get me down
As sure as this big ol' world keeps spinning around
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up, down, over and out
But I know one thing:
Every time I feel that I'm gonna fall flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life, there's no need to deny it
I thought of cutting out once
But this old heart just ain't gonna buy it
But I know that things gon' be shaking when I come see July
Ha, looka here, I wanna know if you know what I'm talking about
I've been a puppet, a pauper, pirate, haha
A pawn and a king
I've been up and down, over and out
But I know one thing:
Every time I fell that I'm gonna fall flat on my face
Now you try it
Pick yourself up and get back in the raceThat's life, there's no need to deny it
I started to quit about three or four months ago
But my fans just wouldn't buy it
So things'll be shaking when I come see July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball
And then I'm gonna get a soul sister from over there tonight
Gonna get me a soul sister from out here tonight
Gotta find a fox for my band now
Gonna have a good time
Gonna have a good time
OH YEAH!
OH YEAH!
I...OH!
