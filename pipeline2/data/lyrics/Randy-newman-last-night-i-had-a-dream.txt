[Verse 1]
Last night I had a dream
You were in it, and I was in it with you
And everyone that I know
And everyone that you know was in my dream
I saw a vampire, I saw a ghost
Everybody scared me, but you scared me the most
In the dream I had last night
In the dream I had last night
[Pre-Chorus]
It started out in a barnyard at sundown
And everyone was laughing
And you were lying on the ground
[Chorus]
You said, "honey, can you tell me what your name is?"
"Honey, can you tell me what your name is?"
I said, "you know what my name is"
[Verse 2]
Last night I had a dream
You were in it, and I was in it with you
And everyone that I know
And everyone that you know was in my dream
I saw a vampire, I saw a ghost
Everybody scared me, but you scared me the most
In the dream I had last night
In the dream I had last night, in my dream
