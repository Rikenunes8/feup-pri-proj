[Verse 1]
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
[Verse 2]
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
[Verse 3]
Ten silver saxes
, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
[Verse 4]
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
[Bridge]
Pa, send me money now
I'm going to make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah
