[Verse 1]
My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on 'til the dawn
My baby takes me higher
My baby keeps me warm
[Chorus]
What you doin' on your back?
What you doin' on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
[Verse 2]
He's juicy and he's trouble
He gets it to me good
My baby gives me power
Goes right down to my blood
[Chorus]
What you doin' on your back?
What you doin' on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
What you doin' on your back?
What you doin' on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
[Chorus]
What you doin' on your back?
What you doin' on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
[Bridge]
My baby takes me higher
My baby keeps me warm
My baby takes me higher
My baby keeps me warm[Chorus]
What you doin' on your back?
What you doin' on your back?
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
