Well you gotta have soap to wash your sins away
You gotta have hope it's the price you gotta pay
You gotta give love or your love will walk away
And you gotta stay loose it's the only way to stay
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, you got it going
Down, da-da-down, da-da-down
Down to the bottom, to the bottom of a hole
Going down
Going down to the bottom, to the bottom of a hole
Going down
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, got it going
Down, going down, down, down
Going down to the bottom of a hole
Going down
I'm going down to the bottom, to the bottom of a hole
Going down
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, you got it going
Down, da-da-down, da-da-down
Down, you got it going
Going 'round, you got it going
Down
Down, you got it going
Going down you got me going
Going down
I'm going down
