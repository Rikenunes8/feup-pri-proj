[Verse 1]
Now, baby when you sigh
(When you sigh)
I want to sigh with you
When you cry
(When you cry)
I want to cry some, too
[Chorus]
Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(That I feel)
In my heart for you
[Verse 2]
When your friends
(When your friends)
Turn their back on you
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
Just to see you through
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Now when you walk
(When you walk)
I want to walk with you
When you talk
(When you talk)
Want to talk some, too
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
If you ever
(If you ever)
Ever need a friend
I'll be with you
(Be with you)
Yes, until the end[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Baby, won't you let me hold your hand
I want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby, don't you need me by your side
To protect you and be your guide
Baby, I'm so in love with you
I'd do anything you tell me to
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you[x3]
Oh!
