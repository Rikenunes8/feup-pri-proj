[Verse 1]
Her daddy got a big aeroplane
Her mommy holds all the family cash
A beautiful rose is standing at the corner
She is living in and out of tune
[Chorus]
Hey you!
You’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing your vitamin C!
Hey you
You’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing your vitamin C!
Your vitamin C
[Verse 2]
A monster press machine is on her body
She's stepping on quicksand
A beautiful rose is standing at the corner
She is living in and out of tune
[Chorus]
Hey you!
You’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing your vitamin C!
Hey you
You’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing your vitamin C!
Your vitamin C
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Hey you!
You’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing your vitamin C!
Hey you!
You’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing, you’re losing your vitamin C!
