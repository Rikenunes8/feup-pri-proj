[Verse 1]
Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home
[Verse 2]
So, I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong
[Chorus]
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (
Rain in my shoes
)
Searching for you in the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
[Verse 3]
Showed your photograph to some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, "Yes, she's been here," but their memory wasn't clear
"Was it yesterday? No, wait, the day before"
[Verse 4]
I finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon?"
As we drove on thru the rain, 
as he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you[Chorus]
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (
Rain in my shoes
)
Searching for you in the cold Kentucky rain
[Outro]
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
The cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
