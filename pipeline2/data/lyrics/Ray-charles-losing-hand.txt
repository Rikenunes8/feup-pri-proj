[Verse]
I gambled on your love, baby, and got a losing hand
I gambled on your love, baby, yes and got a losing hand
Your ways keep changing like the shifting desert sand
[Verse]
While I was playing fair, baby, you played a cheating game
While I was playing fair, baby, you played a cheating game
I know you don't care, but I love you just the same
[Verse]
I thought I'd be your king, baby, yes and you could be my queen
I thought I'd be your king, baby, yes and you could be my queen
But you used me for your joker 'cause I thought your deal was clean
[Verse]
The way you did me, pretty baby, I declare I'll never understand
The way you did me, pretty baby, I declare I'll never understand
I gambled on your love, baby, and got a losing hand
