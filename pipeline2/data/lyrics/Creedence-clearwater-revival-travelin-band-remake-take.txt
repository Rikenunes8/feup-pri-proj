737 coming out of the sky
Oh, won't you take me down to Memphis
On a midnight ride?
I wanna move
Playing in a traveling band, yeah
Well, I'm flying 'cross the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a traveling band
Take me to the hotel
Baggage gone, oh, well
Come on, come on
Won't you get me to my room?
I wanna move
Playing in a traveling band, yeah
Well, I'm flying 'cross the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a traveling band
Listen to the radio
Talking 'bout the last show
Someone got excited
Had to call the state militia
I wanna move
Playing in a traveling band, yeah
Well, I'm flying 'cross the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a traveling band
Oh, wow
Here we come again on a Saturday night
Oh, with your fussing and your fighting
Won't you get me to the right?
I wanna move
Playing in a traveling band, yeah
Well, I'm flying 'cross the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a traveling band
Oh, wowOh, I'm playing in a traveling band
Playing in a traveling band
Won't you get me
Take my hand?
Well, I'm playing in a traveling band
Well, I'm flying 'cross the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a traveling band
Oh, wow
Hey
