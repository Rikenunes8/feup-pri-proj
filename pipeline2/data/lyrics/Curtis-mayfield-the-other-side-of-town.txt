I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair
Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shine
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town
It's hard to do right
In this filthy night
Just plain simple comfort
Is completely out of sight
My little sister
She hungry for bread to eat
My brother's hand-me-down shoes
Is now showing his feet
Ghetto blues showed on the news
All is aware
But what the hell do they care?
You across the track
Completely relaxed
You take a warning fact
Don't you never come backI'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair
Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shine
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town
Oh, baby
It's hard to do right, you know
On the other side of town
This depression really got a hold on me
Oh, baby, on the other side of town
The other side of town
Out of bounds
