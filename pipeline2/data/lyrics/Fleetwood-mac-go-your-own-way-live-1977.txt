[Verse 1]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?
[Chorus]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
[Verse 2]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packin’ up, shackin’ up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you
[Chorus]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
[Instrumental Outro]
