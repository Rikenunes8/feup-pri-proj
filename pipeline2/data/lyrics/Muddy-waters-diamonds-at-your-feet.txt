[Chorus]
She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die oh, one of these days
All the medicine I can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days
[Verse 1]
When she's dead I'm going to bury her very deep[x2]
I'm going to bury her very deep, rubies and diamonds round her feet
She got to take sick and die one of these days
[Chorus]
I got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die oh, one of these days
All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days
[Chorus]
She got to take sick and die one of these days[x2]
All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days
[Verse 2]
If it was me and all the powers in my hands[x2]
If it was me and all the powers laying there child in my hands
She would have to go down to the promised land
