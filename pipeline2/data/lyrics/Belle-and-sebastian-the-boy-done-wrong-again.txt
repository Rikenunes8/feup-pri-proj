[Verse 1]
The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
Are you okay now?
[Verse 2]
On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
You shone louder, longer
You put my shine to shame
Put me to shame now
[Verse 3]
What is it I must do to pay for all my crimes?
What is it I must do?
I would do it all the time
Do it all the time, now
[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to sing the saddest song
And if you would sing along I will be happy now
[Verse 4]
The woodland spring has put the darkness from your thinking
If this town's your sinking ship
Then you know where to jump
Talking dirty for a hobby, that's all right
Pour another glass of wine
I'll think of England this time
[Chorus]
All I wanted was to sing the saddest song
And if you would sing along
Oh, if you would sing along
If you'd only sing along
I would be happier
