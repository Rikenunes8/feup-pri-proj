[Verse 1]
Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was
[Verse 2]
Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright
[Verse 3]
I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright
[Verse 4]
What a crazy day (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher[Outro]
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug...)
