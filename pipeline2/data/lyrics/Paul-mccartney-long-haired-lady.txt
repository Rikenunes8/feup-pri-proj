[Intro]
Well, well, well, well, well
Do you love me like you know you ought to do?
Well, well, well, well, well
Or is this the only thing you want me for?
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for some time
Sweet little lass you are, my long haired lady
[Verse 1]
Who's the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter?
She's the lady who wears those flashing eyes
Who'll be taking her home when all the dancing is over?
I'm the lucky man she will hypnotize
Long haired lady
Long haired lady
[Verse 2]
Bees are buzzing around my sweet, delectable baby
Birds are humming about their big surprise
Who's your favourite person, dear phenomenal lady?
I belong to the girl with the flashing eyes
Long haired lady
Long haired lady
[Chorus]
Ah, love is long, love is long, my love is long
Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long
Win or lose it, winter, summer, love is long, love is long
(When you're wrong, love is long, love is long)
[Intro Reprise]
Well, well, well, well, well
Do you love me like you know you ought to do?
Well, well, well, well, well
Or is this the only thing you want me for?
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for some time
Sweet little lass, you are my long haired lady
[Chorus]
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long
Win or lose it, winter, summer, love is long, love is long
(When you're wrong, love is long, love is long)Win or lose it, winter, summer, love is long, love is long
(Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long)
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long
Win or lose it, winter, summer, love is long, love is long
(Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long)
