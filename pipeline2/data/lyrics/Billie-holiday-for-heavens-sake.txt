For heavens sake, let's fall in love
It's no mistake to call it love
An angel's holding hands with me
How heavenly heaven can be
Here is romance for us to try
Here is the chance we can't deny
While heaven's giving us the break
Let's fall in love for heaven's sake
Don't say a word, my darling
Don't break the spell like this
Just hold me tight, we're alone in the night
And heaven is here in a kiss
This pair of eyes can see a star
So paradise can't be so far
Since heaven's what we're dreaming of
For heavens sake, let's fall in love
Don't say a word, my darling
Don't break the spell like this
Just hold me tight, we're alone in the night
And heaven is here in a kiss
This pair of eyes can see a star
So paradise can't be so far
Since heaven's what we're dreaming of
For heavens sake, let's fall in love
