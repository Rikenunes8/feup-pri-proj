[Pre-Chorus]
Half moon, night time sky
Seven stars, heaven's eyes
Seven songs on seven seas
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me
[Chorus]
Hey, you fill me like the mountains
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You fill me like the sea, Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me, hey
[Verse]
Rings of cloud and arms aflame
Wings rise up to call your name
Sun rolls high, Lord, it burns the ground
Just to tell about the first good man I found
[Chorus]
Hey, you fill me like the mountains
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You fill me like the sea, Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me, hey
[Pre-Chorus]
Half moon, night time sky
Seven stars, heaven's eyes
Seven songs on seven seas
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me
[Chorus]
Hey, you fill me like the mountains
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You fill me like the sea, Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me, heyHey, you fill me like the mountains
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You fill me like the sea, Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me, hey
[Outro]
Won't you bring life to me
I said you're going to ride around
When I'm on a little home babe
Bring it on home, you bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home
I said your love brings life to me, yeah
