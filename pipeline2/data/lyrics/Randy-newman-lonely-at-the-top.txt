[Verse 1]
I've been around the world
Had my pick of any girl
You'd think I'd be happy, but I'm not
Everybody knows my name
But it's just a crazy game
[Chorus]
Oh, it's lonely at the top
[Verse 2]
Listen to the band play, they're playing just for me
Listen to the people paying just for me
All the applause and all the praise
And all the money I have made
[Chorus]
Oh, it's lonely at the top
[Verse 3]
Listen all you fools out there
Go on and love me, I don't care
[Chorus] [2x]
Oh, it's lonely at the top
