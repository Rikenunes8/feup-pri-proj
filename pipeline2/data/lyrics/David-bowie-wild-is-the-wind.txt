[Verse 1]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
[Verse 2]
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
[Verse 3]
Don't you know you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
[Verse 3]
Don't you know you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind[Outro]
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
