[Verse 1]
You may ask me how I know
My Lord is real (My Lord is real)
You may doubt the things I say
And doubt the way I feel (the way I feel)
But I know He's real today
He'll always be (He'll always be)
I can feel His hand in mine
And that's enough for me
[Verse 2]
I will never walk alone
He holds my hand (He holds my hand)
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall, I know He'll understand
Till the day He tells me why
He loves me so
I can feel His hand in mine
That's all I need to know
[Verse 2]
I will never walk alone
He holds my hand (He holds my hand)
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall, I know He'll understand
Till the day He tells me why
He loves me so (He loves me so)
I can feel His hand in mine
That's all I need to know
[Outro]
I can feel His hand in mine
That's all I need to know
I can feel His hand in mine
That's all I need to know
