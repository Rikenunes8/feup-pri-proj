[Verse 1]
Got to get some food
I'm so hungry all the time
[Refrain]
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
[Verse 2]
Got to get some sleep
I'm so nervous in the night
[Refrain]
But I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
[Verse 3]
I got to pick up the phone
I will call any number
I will talk to anyone
I know I've gone too far
Much too far I gone this time
I don't want to think what I've done
[Refrain]
'Cause I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
[Bridge]
There are always hidden silences
Waiting behind the chair
They come out when the coast is clear
They eat anything that moves
I go shaky at the knees
Lights go out, stars come down
Like a swarm of bees[Chorus]
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self...
No, no
[Verse 4]
You know I hate to hurt you
I hate to see your pain
[Refrain]
But I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
[Verse 5]
Street after street
Night after night
I walk on through the rain
I walk on through the rain[Refrain]
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Hey, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
