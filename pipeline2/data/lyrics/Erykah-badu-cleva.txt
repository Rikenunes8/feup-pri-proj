[Verse 1]
This is how I look without makeup
And with no bra my ninny's sag down low
My hair ain't never hung down to my shoulders
And it might not grow
You never know
But I'm clever when I bust a rhyme
I'm cleva always on ya mind
She's cleva and I really wanna grow
But why come you're the last to know?
I got a little pot in my belly
So now a days my figure ain't so fly
My dress ain't cost nothin' but seven dollars
But I made it fly
And I'll tell you why
But I'm clever when I bust a rhyme
I'm cleva always on ya mind
She's cleva and I really wanna grow
But why come I'm the last to know?
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright yeah
Alright with me
Said that I'm alright with me
Said that I'm alright with me
Said that I'm alright with me
Said that I'm alright with me
Said that I'm alright with me
Said that I'm alright with me
Alright with me
Alright alright alright
