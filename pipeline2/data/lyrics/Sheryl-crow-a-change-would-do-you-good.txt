[Verse 1]
Ten years 
livin' in a paper bag
Feedback, baby, he's a flipped out cat
He's a platinum canary, drinkin' Falstaff beer
Mercedes Ruehl and a rented Lear
Bottom feeder, insincere
Prophet lo-fi pioneer
Sell the house and go to school
Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel
[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
[Verse 2]
God's little gift is on the rag
Poster girl posin' in a fashion mag
Canine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde
You wear your fake fur on the inside
Queen of South Beach, aging blues
Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes
I thought you were singin' your heart out to me
Your lips were syncing and now I see
[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)[Verse 3]
Chasin' dragons
 with plastic swords
Jack off Jimmy, everybody wants more
Scully and angel on the kitchen floor
And I'm callin' Buddy on the Ouija board
I've been thinkin' 'bout catchin' a train
Leave my 
phone machine
 by the 
radar range
"Hello it's me, I'm not at home
If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone"
[Refrain]
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
"Hello, it's me, I'm not at home
If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone"
[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, I think a change (A change would do you good)
