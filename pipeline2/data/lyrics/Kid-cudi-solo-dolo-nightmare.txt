[Verse 1]
Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no
[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right?
 Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Look at me, you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Verse 3]
My world turns, flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights
 where they knew who
Dos little brother was a strange one, 
boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater, look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy[Verse 4]
Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is, what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey
[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
[Outro]
Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong? It's wrong
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
