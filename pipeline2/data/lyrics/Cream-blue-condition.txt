[Verse 1]
Don't take the wrong direction passing through
Instead of deep reflection of what's true
For it's a combination of judgments made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through
[Chorus]
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition
[Verse 2]
Early rising every day
You must be enterprising in your way
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun
Life would be one disaster all the way through
[Chorus]
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition
[Verse 3]
Don't take the wrong direction passing through
Instead of deep reflection of what's true
For it's a combination of judgements made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through
[Chorus]
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue condition
