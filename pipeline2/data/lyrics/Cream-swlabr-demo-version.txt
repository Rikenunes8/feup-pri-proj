Comin' to me in the morning, leavin' me at night
Comin' to me in the morning, leavin' me alone
You've got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard
Runnin' to me a-cryin' when he throws you out
Runnin' to me a-cryin' on your own again
You've got that pure feel, such good responses
But the picture has a mustache
You're come in to me with that soulful look on your face
You come in lookin' like you've never ever done one wrong thing
You're comin' to me with that soulful look on your face
You're comin' lookin' like you never ever done one wrong thing
So many fantastic colours, I feel in a wonderland
Many fantastic colours makes me feel so good
You've got that pure feel, such good responses
Got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard
