[Verse 1]
You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you
[Pre-Chorus]
(Help me)
I broke apart my insides
(Help me)
I've got no soul to sell
(Help me)
The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself
[Chorus]
I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God
[Verse 2]
You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything
[Pre-Chorus]
(Help me)
You tear down my reason
(Help me)
It's your sex I can smell
(Help me)
You make me perfect
Help me become somebody else
[Chorus]
I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God[Outro]
Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scraped off my knees
I drink the honey
Inside your hive
You are the reason
I stay alive
