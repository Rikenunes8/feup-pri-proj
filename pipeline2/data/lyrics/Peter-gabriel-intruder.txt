[Verse 1]
I know something about
Opening windows and doors
I know how to move quietly
To creep across creaky wooden floors
I know where to find precious things
In all your cupboards and drawers
[Chorus]
Slipping the clippers
Slipping the clippers through the telephone wires
A sense of isolation
Inspires, inspires me
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
I like to feel the suspense
When I'm certain you know I am there
I like you lying awake
Your bated breath charging the air
I like the touch and the smell
Of all the pretty dresses you wear
[Chorus]
Intruder's happy in the dark
Intruder come
Intruder come and he leave his mark
Leave his mark, leave his mark
[Interlude]
[Outro]
I am the intruder
