And you'll never walk alone
When you walk
Through a storm
Hold your head
Hold it up high
And don't
Don't you be afraid
Of the dark
For at the end
At the end of the storm
There is a golden
A golden sky
And sweet
Silver song
Of the lark
Walk on
Walk on through the wind
Get your courage together
Yeah, and walk on
Walk on through the rain
Although your dreams be tossed
I know sometimes they get tossed and they get blown
What you gotta do is walk on
That sounds mighty mighty good to me right now, walk on
With just a little bit of hope (Right on, right on)
Right on, right on (Right on, right on)
With just a little bit of hope in your heart
And you'll never, you won't never, I will never
I know that He will never let you walk alone
You'll never walk alone
(Angels to guide you)
He'll put two angels on your side
Oh, yes He will (He'll walk beside you)
He'll put all of His angels beside you, yeah
Yes He will
And you won't ever walk
You won't walk alone
You'll never walk
He won't let you walk alone
(You will never walk alone) Not alone, not alone
