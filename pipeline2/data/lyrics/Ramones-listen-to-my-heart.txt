[Intro]
1-2-3-4
[Chorus 1]
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart

That girl could still be mine
But I'm tired of the hurt
I'm tired of trying
I'm tired of the pain
I'm tired of trying
I'm tired of crying
[Chorus 1]
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
