Tell me why tell me why tell me why
Mmm, why can't we live together?
Tell me why tell me why
Mmm, why can't we live together?
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
No more war, no more war, no more war
Mmm, just a little peace
No more war, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
No matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
I said no matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
Everybody wants to live
Everybody's got to be together
Everybody wants to live
Everybody's got to be together
Everybody's got to be together
Everybody wants to be together
I said no matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
I said no matter, no matter what color
You are still my brother
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
Gotta live together
Together!
