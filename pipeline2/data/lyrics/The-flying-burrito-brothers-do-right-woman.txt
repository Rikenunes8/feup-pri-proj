Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody else could make me do wrong
Take me for granted and I'll tag along
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong
A woman's only human
This you must understand
She's not just a plaything
She expects love just like a man
So, if you want a do right all day woman
You got to be a do right all night man
They say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
So as long as we're together, baby
You better show some respect for me
So, if you want a do right all day woman
You got to be a do right all night man
You got to be a do right all night man
You got to be a do right all night man
