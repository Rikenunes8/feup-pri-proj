[Verse 1]
I just want to talk to you
I won't uh, do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives
On this here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages, tall and cold
And some just stay there and, dust away
Past the age of old
[Chorus]
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you
[Verse 2]
I just want to know about
The rooms behind your minds
Do I see a vacuum there
Or am I going blind?
Or is it just uh, remains from vibrations
And echoes long ago
Things like "Love the World"
And uh, "Let your fancy Flow"
[Chorus]
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you
Let me talk to you
[Verse 3]
I have lived here before, the days of ice
And of course this is why I'm so concerned
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
And the smell of a world that has burned
A smell of the world that has burned
[Bridge]
Yeah well, maybe
Maybe it's just a change of climate
I can dig it
I can dig it baby, I just want to see[Verse 4]
So where do I purchase my ticket?
I would just like to have a ringside seat
I want to know about the new Mother Earth
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
[Outro]
Aw, shucks
If my daddy could see me now
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
