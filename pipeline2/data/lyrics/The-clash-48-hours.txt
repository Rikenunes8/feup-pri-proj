[Verse 1]
Friday or Saturday, what does that mean?
Short space of time and needs a heavy scene
Monday is comin' like a jail on wheels
[Chorus]
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a-forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrills
[Verse 2]
So tell me, and I'll take the tube
You know a girl, yeah, well, she's bound to be rude
Can't a-get a-nothin' at the places I've been
[Chorus]
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a-forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, thrills
[Verse 3]
I've combed this town from top to bottom
Try to get around but my legs are broken
Every time I miss it 'cause I ain't got a ticket
[Chorus]
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrills
Cheap thrills
And he got thrills
Kickin' for kicks
[Chorus]
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills
