[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
[Verse 1]
Black man got a lotta problems
But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be thick
[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
[Verse 2]
All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it
[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own[Bridge]
Hey, you, standing in line
Are we gonna sign an agreement?
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
