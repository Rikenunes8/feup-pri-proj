[Intro]
Oh yeah
[Verse 1]
In France a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun Is being in a gang called The Disciples, high on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time
Time
[Verse 2]
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse; it's June
Time
Time
[Chorus]
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Time
Time
[Verse 3]
Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time
Time
[Chorus]
Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Sign o' the Times
Time
Time[Outro]
Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy
Time
Time
