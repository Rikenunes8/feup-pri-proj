My head is a-spinnin' round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve, boys
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head
I will call my home
Well I see that the world is upside-down
Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
Now the clouds went and covered everything o'er
And the wind is blowing cold
I don't need anybody
Because I learned, I learned to be alone
And I say anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys
I will call my home
