Tell me, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you
Hoo hoo, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you
Now you have a little new calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turning blue
Your calf is hungry, and I believe he needs a suck
Your calf is hungry, hoo hoo, I believe he needs a suck
But your milk is turning blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck
Now I feel like milking and my, cow won't come
I feel like chu'in' and my, milk won't turn
I'm crying please, please don't do me wrong
If you can old milkcow, baby now, hoo hoo, drive home
My milkcow been rambling, hoo hoo, for miles around
My milkcow been rambling, hoo hoo, for miles around
Well, she been troubling some other bull cow, hoo hoo, in this man's town
