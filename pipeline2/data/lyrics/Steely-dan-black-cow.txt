[Verse 1]
In the corner of my eye
I saw you in Rudy's
You were very high
You were high
It was a cryin' disgrace
They saw your face
On the counter 
by your keys
Was a book of numbers
And your remedies
One of these
Surely will screen out the sorrow
But where are you tomorrow
[Chorus]
I can't cry anymore
While you run around
(
While you run around
)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
[Verse 2]
Down to Greene Street
There you go
Lookin' so outrageous
And they tell you so
You should know
How all the pros play the game?
Then you change your name
Like a 
gangster on the run
You will stagger homeward
To your precious one
I'm the one
Who must make everything right
Talk it out 'til daylight[Chorus]
I don't care anymore
Why you run around
(
Why you run around
)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I can't cry anymore
While you run around
(
While you run around
)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
[Outro]
So outrageous
So outrageous
So outrageous
