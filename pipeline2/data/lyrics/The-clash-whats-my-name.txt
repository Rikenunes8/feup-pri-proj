[Verse 1]
What the hell is wrong with me?
I'm not who I want to be
I tried 
spot cream
 and I tried it all
Crawlin' up the wall
[Chorus]
What's my name?
Name
Name
[Verse 2]
I tried to join a ping-pong club
Sign on the door said "All full up"
I got nicked, fightin' in the road
The judge didn't even know
[Chorus]
What's my name?
Name
Name
[Bridge]
Dad got pissed so I got clocked
Couldn't hear the Tannoy so he lost the lot
Offers mum a bribe through the letter box
Drives you fucking mad
[Verse 3]
I'm 'round the back of your house at night
Peepin' in the window, are you sleepin' tight?
I laugh at your locks with my celluloid strip
And you won't know who came
[Outro]
What's my name?
Name
Name
What's my name?
Name
Name
