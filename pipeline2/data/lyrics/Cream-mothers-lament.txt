[Intro]
Are we rollin'? A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four...
[Verse]
A mother was washing her baby one night
The youngest of ten and a delicate mite
The mother was poor, and the baby was thin
Twas naught but an skellington covered with skin
The mother turned 'round for a soap off the rack
She was only a moment, but a-when she turned back
Her baby had gone and in anguish she cried
"Oh, where 'as my baby gone?" The angels replied
"Oh, your baby has gone down the plug-'ole
Oh, your baby has gone down the plug
The poor little thing was so skinny and thin
He should 'ave been washed in a jug, in a jug
Your baby is perfectly happy
He won't need a bath anymore
He's a-muckin' about with the angels above
Not lost, but gone before"
[Outro]
Thank you
Do you wanna do it again?
