[Chorus 1]
Oh, If I should die tonight
Oh, baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar yeah
Because I've known you
[Verse 1]
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, darling, have felt their world stand still?
[Chorus 2]
Millions never, they never never
And millions never will baby
They never will
[Chorus 1]
If I should die tonight, love
Darling, far before my time
I won't die blue
Because I've known you
[Bridge]
Ooh, I'm so grateful baby
Grateful that you're loving me
My desire
Is to love you 'til
I'm no longer here, and never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful
[Verse 2]
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh darling, have felt their world stand still?
Oh, Lord[Chorus 2]
Oh, millions never, no, never never
And millions never will, sugar
They never will
[Outro]
If I should die tonight, oh, baby
I just want you to keep this one thought in mind
That I will never die blue
'Cause I've known you
