If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Now, would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If I take on a tinkers trade
Would you still find me?
Oh, carryin' the pots I made
Followin' closer behind me
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
'Cause I have given you my ownliness
Give me part of your tomorrow
If I work my hands in wood
Would you still love me?
Ah, answer me babe, yes I would
I'd raise you high above me
If I was a miller at a mill wheel grindin'
Now would you miss your color box?
And your soft shoes shining?
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Girl, would you marry me anyway?
I want you have my baby
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Now would you marry me anyway?
Won't you have my baby?
