[Chorus]
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
[Verse 1]
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing
[Verse 2]
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
[Chorus]
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
[Outro]
You'll go to hell for what your
Dirty mind is thinking
