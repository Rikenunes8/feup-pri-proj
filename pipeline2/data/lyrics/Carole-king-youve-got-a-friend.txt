[Verse 1]
When you're down and troubled
And you need 
some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
[Verse 2]
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old North wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah-eah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Yes I will
[Bridge]
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them
[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah-eah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will (oh, yes I will)[Outro]
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Oh, yeah now
You've got a friend
Yeah baby
You've got a friend
Oh, yeah
You've got a friend
