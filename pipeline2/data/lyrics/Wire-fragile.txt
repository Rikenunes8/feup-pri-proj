[Verse 1]
Tears fall in slivers, you broke my shades
The light's too bright, let me bury my heart
Filter emotions of 
green
, cowardice gives 
blue
A restricted view, let me open my heart
[Hook]
I have a fleeting love, scorching when it lands
Fragile
Needing precious hands
Fragile, fragile
Fragile
[Verse 2]
You eat my energy, give me more rope
Nail in the wall, let me hang my heart
Hang my heart
[Hook]
I have a fleeting love, scorching when it lands
Fragile
Needing precious hands
Fragile, fragile
Fragile
