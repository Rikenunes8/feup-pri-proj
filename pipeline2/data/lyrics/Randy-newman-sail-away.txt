[Verse 1]
In America you get food to eat
Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet
You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day
It's great to be an American
[Verse 2]
Ain't no lion or tiger, ain't no mamba snake
Just the 
sweet watermelon
 and the buckwheat cake
Everybody is as happy as a man can be
Climb aboard, little wog, sail away with me
[Chorus]
Sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay
Sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay
[Verse 3]
In America every man is free
To take care of his home and his family
You'll be as happy as a monkey in a monkey tree
You're all gonna be an American
[Chorus]
Sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay
Sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay
