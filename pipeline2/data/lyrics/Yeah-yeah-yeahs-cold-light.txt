Cold Light
Hot night
Be my heater be my lover
And we could do it to each other
Cold Light
Hot night
Be my heater be my lover
And we could do it to each other
Go go go go go!
Ride daddy, ride
Ride out the tide
I'd rather die
Than hear goodbye
And watch you go
Go go go go!
Ride daddy, ride
Ride out the tide
I'd rather die
Than hear goodbye
And watch you go
Go go go go
Cold light
Hot night
Be my heater be my lover
And we could do it to each other
Yeah, we could do it to each other
We're like a sister and a brother
Go go go go go!
Ride momma, ride
Ride out the tide
I'd rather die
Than hear goodbye
And watch you go!
