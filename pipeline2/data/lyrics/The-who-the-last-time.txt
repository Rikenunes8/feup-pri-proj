[Verse 1]
Well, I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know, it should come easy
[Chorus]
Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Baby, the last time, I don't know
Oh no, oh no
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm sorry girl, but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
Too much pain and too much sorrow
I guess I'll feel the same tomorrow
[Chorus]
Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Baby, the last time, I don't know
Oh no, oh no
[Chorus]
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Baby, the last time, I don't know
Oh no, oh no
[Verse 3]
Told you once and I told you twice
Someone had to pay the price
Here's a chance to change your mind
'Cause I've been gone a long, long time
[Chorus]
Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Baby, the last time, I don't know
Oh no, oh no, baby, oh no[Outro]
(Let me easy, oh no, no, no)
Baby, the last time
Baby, the last time
Baby, the last time
Baby, the last time
Baby, the last time...
