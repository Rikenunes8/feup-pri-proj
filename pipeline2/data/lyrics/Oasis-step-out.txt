[Verse 1]
What she said, she said to me
Take me high on a mountain side
She was dressed up in leopard skin
And her soul would never be denied
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I met her down the disco in a beat up car
She was burning down the road
She looked just like a star in a Jaguar
She needs to lighten her load
[Chorus 1]
And when you might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
You might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
[Verse 2]
What I said, I said to her
I'm alive when you walk that way
Can you hear what I can hear?
It's the sound of a brand new day
[Pre-Chorus 2]
She met me down the disco in a beat up car
I was burning down the road
I could be a star in a Jaguar
I need to lighten my load
[Chorus]
Because you might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
You might, think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
[Bridge]
My whole life been sinking in the water
I need a ship not your sweet lip tonight[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
You might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
You might think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
When you might, think you're gonna cry
It will be all right, step out tonight
[Outro]
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
