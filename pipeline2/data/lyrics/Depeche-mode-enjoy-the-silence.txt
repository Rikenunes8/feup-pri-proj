[Verse 1]
Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl
[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable
[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm[Interlude]
[Outro]
Enjoy the silence
