[Verse 1]
Got me a raygun
Got me an altitude
Can't help feelin' something's wrong
With every one of you
[Chorus]
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
[Verse 2]
Talk revolution
As if it matters now
I don't care anyway
Just give me what I want
[Chorus]
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Ooh, honey
[Bridge]
Fill me with your little whispers
Still they think of nightmares
Of a generation sent to burn
Come on, honey
Let's go for a ride
Down where the crickets learn to sing and play, baby
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your headYeah, it's a motherfucker
Oh, hey
