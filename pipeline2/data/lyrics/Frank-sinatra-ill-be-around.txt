[Verse 1]
I'll be around no matter how you treat me now
I'll be around from now on
Your latest love can never last and when it's past
I'll be around when he's gone
[Verse 2]
Goodbye again
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then
Drop a line to say you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone
[Verse 3]
Goodbye again
Now and then
Drop a line to say that you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone
