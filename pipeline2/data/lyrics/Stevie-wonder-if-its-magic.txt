[Verse 1]
If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting?
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poet's endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
[Verse 2]
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving?
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
[Chorus]
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
[Verse 3]
So if it's special
Then with it, why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style?
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child
[Chorus]
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
[Verse 4]
So if it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting?
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone[Outro]
Oh
Oh
