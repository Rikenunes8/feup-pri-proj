Strange brew
Killin' what's inside of you
She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you, with you
Now what you gonna do?
Strange brew
Killin' what's inside of you
She's some kind of demon messing in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you, to you
What kind of fool are you?
Strange brew
Killin' what's inside of you
On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?
Strange brew
Killin' what's inside of you
Strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew
Killin' what's inside of you
