So you've got to live up to your name
Or else I'll put you to shame, listen
If you say you a selector
You a fe have good selection
A-and I say if you say you a the special
Man, I say I want to know your potential
You a say you a madness
You a say you a the best
But when I put you upon you feet
A-some a-some a say you can't play de beat
And I hear you say a Clash a you ruler
Say a Clash sound cooler, eh
Say a Clash sound sweeter
And now-a-days man a measure mile in a meter, eh
Live up to your name
Or else you die in shame
A-and a so me say fe live up to your name
A so me tell you say you die in shame
Some a dem a bodysnatcher
Some a dem a barracuda, eh
But who a know fe me Jah Jah
Fe me Jah a me creator, eh
Flying saucers, rock-and-roll
Natty Dread a fe be in control
It's all in the whirlwind
I say you've gone with the blockhead
A-and I say me say that some a dem a Sex Pistol
Nipple erectors
A so me tell you set dem sp [?] man a gone
An [?] farm
And I'll tell you about the X-generation
Me know dem a victimed
Because dem no know fe me sweet Jah Jah, eh
Clash a you ruler
Say a Clash sound cooler
A-and I tell you say a Clash sound sweeter
And now-a-days man measure mile in a meter
A none a dem deh measure gallon in a litre
And I tell you say me know them a cheat youBecause when you living in a fame
You got to live up to your name
Or else a suffer and you die in a shame
And I tell you say it's all in the game, eh
Some a say them a selector

Or else deh moving in the wrong direction
And they no know this a reggae vibration
A-and a so me say a Clash a you ruler
And dis you one a say it a musically cooler, eh
Me say we live up to your name
Or else you suffer and you die in a shame
Because when you living in a fame
A so me tell you say it's all in the game
And so me talking about

Big body snatcher, [?], eh
Flying saucers, rock-and-roll
See you gone in the whirlwind
A-and I tell you say, a you a the blockhead
And some will tell you that you dreader than dread
(Chorus 1)
When you living in a fame
You got to live up to your name
Or else you suffer and you die in a shame

We no want no strife
Game of life
We no want no strife, no no
Don't, no no no no
