[Verse 1]
The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
Down the road I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
[Verse 2]
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
[Verse 3]
Then I awake and look around me
To the cold gray walls that surround me
And then I realize I was only dreaming
For there's a guard, and a sad old padre
Arm in arm, I walk at daybreak
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home
[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of the old tree as they lay me
'Neath the green, green grass of home
[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much
