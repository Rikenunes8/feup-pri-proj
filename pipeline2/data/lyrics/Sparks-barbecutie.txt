[Verse 1]
For the sake of man
He has forsaken his whole tan
Living in the snow
Advancing how much we will know
But his heart cries out
[Chorus]
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie
When you're with him he is warm
[Verse 2]
Let's pursue this more
Why would he leave so much that's warm
To his detriment
Maybe he's oh so slightly bent
Ask her, she would know
[Chorus]
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie
When you're with him he is warm
[Bridge]
The friends are getting friendly on the lawn
The flies are making enemies of all
Aroma rising from the ancient coals
Have turned you into someone very bold
And killed whatever hesitance she showed
[Chorus]
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
You, you, you
[Verse 3]
Though he's back unharmed
He must defrost his frozen charm
"How are you today"
That's very good, he's on his way
To the Barbecue[Chorus]
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
