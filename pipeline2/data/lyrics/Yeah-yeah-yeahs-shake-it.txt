[Chorus]
Now shake it
North, west, south, left
East, and to the right
Now take it
To a place we've never been
Out of sight
[Verse 1]
Well, the floor, girl
Is yours, girl
To alight
And the score, girl
Will be settled
On the floor tonight
[Chorus]
Now shake it
North, west, south, left
East, and to the right
Now take it
To a place we've never been
To a place we've never been
Yeah, out of sight
[Outro]
Well, shake it
Shake, shake
Yeah, shake it
Shake, shake
Ha!
