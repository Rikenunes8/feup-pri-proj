[Verse 1]
How could that happen?
How could that happen again?
Where the fuck was I looking
When all his horses came in?
And he built an army
Of kamikaze
[Verse 2]
10,000 willing
Pilots flying
Interfacing
Space and beyond
Built an army
To come and find me
[Verse 3]
Beyond all reason
Beyond all my hopes
The call of duty
Another war zone
Make me mo-moan
[Chorus]
Kamikaze, kamikaze
You can't touch me, kamikaze
[Verse 4]
Eight miles high
He walks his path
And I follow mine
One tooth for one eye
He's come to find me
[Verse 5]
10,000 willing
Pilots flying
Interfacing
Space and beyond
Here is his army
Space and here we come[Chorus]
Kamikaze, kamikaze
You don't touch me, kamikaze
Kamikaze, you don't touch me
Kamikaze, you don't touch me
[Outro]
Space here we come
