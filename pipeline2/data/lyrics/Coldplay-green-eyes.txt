[Verse 1]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you?
[Chorus]
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes
[Verse 2]
Honey, you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know
[Pre-Chorus 2]
That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind
[Chorus]
Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you[Post-Chorus]
Green eyes
Green eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
