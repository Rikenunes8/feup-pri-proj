Don't deceive me, please don't leave me
What would I do without you to see me through?
If you leave me, then you leave me
What would I do without you to see me through?
What would I do? Say, I wanna know
What would I do? Where would I go?
Ah you please me when you squeeze me
What would I do without you to see me through?
Yes, I'll pray about my babe, oh yes I am
What would I do, oh Lord, without you to see me through?
