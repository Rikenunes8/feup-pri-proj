And I feel so lonesome
You hear me when I moan
When I feel so lonesome
You hear me when I moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane
For you since I been gone?
I'd said, "I'll flash your lights, mama
Your horn won't even blow"
Somebody's been runnin'
My batteries down on this machine
I even flash my lights, mama
This horn won't even blow
Got a short in this connection
Hoo well, babe, it's way down below
I'm goin' heist your hood, mama
I'm bound to check your oil
I'm goin' heist your hood, mama
I'm bound to check your oil
I got a woman that I'm lovin'
Way down in Arkansas
Now, you know the coils ain't even buzzin'
Little generator won't get the spark
Motor's in a bad condition
You gotta have these batteries charged
But I'm cryin', please, please don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane
Now for you since I been gone
Mr. Highway Man, please don't block the road
Please, please don't block the road
Cause she's reachin' a cold one hundred
And I'm booked and I got to go
Yoo, you hear me weep and moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane
Now for you since I been gone
I'm gon' get down in this connection
Keep on tanglin' with your wires
I'm gon' get down in this connection
Oh well, keep on tanglin' with these wires
And when I mash down on your little starter
Then your spark plug will give me fire
