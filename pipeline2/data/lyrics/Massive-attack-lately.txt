[Verse 1]
Summertime always gives me the blues
Thinking about the things we used to do
Watching lovers in the park making love so free
And now I realize there's only me
[Chorus]
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
[Verse 2]
You've been acting like a cat on a hot tin roof
Something's on your mind that you can't share
You never used to hide your feelings for me
Keeping secrets I don't understand
[Chorus]
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
[Bridge]
I used to synchronize it with your body
Making it so tight, never letting go
I used to synchronize it with your body
Making it so tight, never letting go
[Outro]
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
Lately, lately, lately, lately
Lately, baby, where did we go wrong, where did we go wrong?
Missed your touch, missed your touch
