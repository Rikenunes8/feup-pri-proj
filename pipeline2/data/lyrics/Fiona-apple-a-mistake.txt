[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a mistake
I'm gonna do it on purpose
I'm gonna waste my time
Cause I'm full as a tick
And I'm scratching at the surface
And what I find is mine
And when the day is done and I look back
And the fact is I had fun
Fumbling around
All the advice I shunned and I ran
Where they told me not to run
But I sure had fun
So I'm gonna fuck it up again
I'm gonna do another detour
Unpave my path
And if you wanna make sense
Whatcha lookin' at me for?
I'm no good at math
And when I find my way back
The fact is I just may stay
Or I may not
[Pre-Chorus]
I've acquired quite a taste
For a well-made mistake
I wanna make a mistake
Why can't I make a mistake?
[Chorus]
I'm always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why?
[Verse 2]
Do I wanna do right?
Of course
But do I really wanna feel I'm forced to answer you?
Hell no
[Pre-Chorus]
I've acquired quite a taste
For a well-made mistake
I wanna make a mistake
Why can't I make a mistake?
[Chorus]
I'm always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why?
