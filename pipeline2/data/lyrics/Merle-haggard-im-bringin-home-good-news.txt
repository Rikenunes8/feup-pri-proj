[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm bringing home some good news
Got some things you'll be glad to hear
Like I'm leaving town and I'll be back around
Just long enough to get my gear
[Chorus]
There won't be any goodbye kissing
Well, I'm putting on my leaving shoes
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringing home good news
[Verse 2]
Well, I was sitting downtown in a tavern
When I made up my mind to go
And I knew you would be so glad to be free
I just thought I'd call and let you know
[Chorus]
Oh, you can tell all your backdoor daddies
That your big daddy's done blew a fuse
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringing home good news
[Verse 3]
To you, I've been known as bad news
Well, I'm changing my first name
And I'm giving you your freedom, baby
That oughta rate some kind of change
[Chorus]
You won't have to hide your milkman's slippers
I won't be looking around for clues
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah I'm bringing home good news
[Outro]
Good news, got some good news for you honey
I'm bringing home some good news
I'm bringing home some good news, honey
