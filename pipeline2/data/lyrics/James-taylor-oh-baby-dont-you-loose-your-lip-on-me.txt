Oh, baby
Don't you loose your lip on me no, no no
Lord, have mercy, baby, now now now
Don't you loose your lip on poor old loving man JT, no woah
Now, I've tried so hard to be your good boy
Good God almighty, don't you know, mama
Tell me what more, what more
In this world, in this whole wide world can one good boy
Just one by himself man be, no woah
