Look at my hand, there's a soul on fire
You can lead me even higher
It's the main thing
The main thing
The main thing
Everybody knows there's a good thing gone
You can really turn me on
It's the main thing
The main thing
The main thing
You burn through here with your words of sand
I can nearly understand
It's the main thing
The main thing
The main thing
The main thing
