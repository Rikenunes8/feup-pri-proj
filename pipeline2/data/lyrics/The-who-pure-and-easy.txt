[Intro]
There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breath rippling by
The note is eternal, I hear it it sees me
Forever we blend and forever we die
[Chorus]
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
[Verse 1]
As people assemble civilization
Is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives
[Chorus]
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
[Verse 2]
Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy
[Bridge]
We all know success when we all find our own dreams
And our love is enough to knock down any walls
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
[Guitar solo][Chorus]
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
[Intro reprise]
There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breath rippling by
[Outro]
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen
