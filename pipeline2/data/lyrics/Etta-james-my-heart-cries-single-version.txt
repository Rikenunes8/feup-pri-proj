I was lost in the world of dreams
Counting every star
Shining overhead it seems
I was like a Shepard boy
Searching for his lamb
Here and there and everywhere
You came, oh yeah, you captured me
You and all your charms, oh
Yes, you set me free
We kissed and the world was all aglow
And my heart cried, "Oh, oh, oh, I love you so"
Then my heart cried, "Oh, oh, oh, I love you so"
Then my heart cried, "Oh, oh, oh, I love you so
Love you so, love you so"
