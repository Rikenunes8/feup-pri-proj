[Intro]
I'll never stand in your way, I'll never stand in your way
[Verse]
If you've found someone new who means more than me to you
Well, I'll never stand in your way (
I'll never stand in your way
)
If you feel we must part, don't let pity ruin your heart
Because I'll never stand in your way
Mhm, I love you much too much ever lose you (
Ever lose you
)
But what is to be will be and I'll obey (
I'll obey
)
I'll be blue when you go, but I'll never let it show
And I'll never let it stand in your way
You see, I love you much too much ever lose you (
To ever lose you
)
But what is to be will be and I'll obey (
I'll obey
)
I'll be blue when you go, but I'll never let it show
And I'll never let it stand in your way (
I'll never stand in your way
)
[Outro]
Oh, no
