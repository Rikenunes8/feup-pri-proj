I think we can signify our love now
Ooh, girl, you can initiate an impulse of love
Stay hungry, stay hungry, stay hungry
Move a muscle, move a muscle, move a muscle
Make a motion, make a motion, make a motion
Pull it tighter, pull it tighter, pull it tighter
Double beating, double beating, double beating
Double beating, double beating, double beating
Palpitation, palpitation, palpitation
Stay hungry, stay hungry, stay hungry
Here's that rhythm again
Here's my shoulder blade
Here's the sound I made
Here's the picture I saved
(Here I am)
