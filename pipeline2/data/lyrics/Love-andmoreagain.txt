[Verse 1]
And if you'll see Andmoreagain
Then you will know Andmoreagain
For you can see you in her eyes
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum
[Verse 2]
And when you've given all you had
And everything still turns out
Bad, and all your secrets are your own
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum
[Chorus]
And I'm wrapped in my armor
But my things are material
And I'm lost in confusions
Cause my things are material
And you don't know how much I love you
Oh, oh, oh...
[Verse 3]
And if you'll see Andmoreagain
Then you might be Andmoreagain
For you just wish and you are here
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum
[Chorus]
And I'm wrapped in my armor
But my things are material
And I'm lost in confusions
Cause my things are material
And you don't know how much I love you
Oh, oh, oh...
