[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Expectantly, too punctual, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now
, more constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment that hangs in abasement
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl
[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
Walking through walls in the heart of December
The blindness, the happiness, falling down laughing
But I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
All this in an instant before I can kiss you
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl
[Bridge]
(Your name like ice into my heart)
[Verse 3]
I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
And even if we drink, I don't think we will kiss
In the way that we did when the woman was only a girl
