[Intro: Stevie Wonder & 
Michael Jackson
]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-nah!
Hoo-hoo! Dancin'-hee!
Doggone lover!
C'mon, boy
[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see, her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe (Hee!)
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)
[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me–ooh)
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!
Just good friends
Ah! Chika-chika-ah! Ooo
(Doot-do-do-doo, hee! Aaow!)
Just good friends
[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder, 
Stevie & Michael
]
You better take advice
Never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair
From their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand
[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & 
Michael Jackson
]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me–ooh)[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Now if they ask you
Jus' tell 'em that we're just good friends
Yes, just good friends
(Just good friends)
Root-do-do-do
(Doot-do-do-do)
(Just good friends)

Stevie Wonder

Listen up, hee!
We've got a problem here
I can see the signs
I guess the lady 
is still making up her mind
Say: "We're just good friends" (Ohhh!)
[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there
You doggone Lover, hee!
Aaow!
Don't you wanna know?
[Outro: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares (Hee! Hee!)
