[Verse]
There's a certain hill outside of town called Sam Hill
And a certain guy used to go there every day
They said a certain girl lived up in Sam Hill
Aw, a pretty girl not hep to city ways
This certain guy would come down the hill a-smiling
Heading back to town at the crack of dawn
And he had them all a-wonderin' what he was doing
Yeah, wondering what in Sam Hill's going on
We knew this certain guy was not a gold miner
'Cause he never took a shovel or a pick
He only took a little box of candy
And disappeared in Sam Hill mighty quick
We tried to follow him to his destination
But he had a secret path and soon he was gone
And he had us all a-wonderin' what he was doing
Yeah, wondering what in Sam Hill's going on
I know that you have wondered too about Sam Hill
You've probably asked "What in Sam Hill's going on?"
All I can say in answer to your question
Is the goin's on are still going on
This certain guy's still taking up his candy
He's 99 and all his youth is gone
But he climbs that hill and still comes down a-smiling
And we're wondering what in Sam Hill's going on
Wish I knew
What in Sam Hill's going on
He won't tell us
What in Sam Hill's going on
He just snickers
What in Sam Hill's going on
