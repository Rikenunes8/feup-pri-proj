[Chorus]
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
Oh, you kept on shaking me, darling
Oh, you messed up my happy home
[Verse 1]
You know you move me, baby
Just like a hurricane
You know you move me, baby
Just like a hurricane
Oh, you know you move me, darling
Just like an earthquake moves the land
[Verse 2]
Oh, sometimes I wonder
What my poor wife and child's gon' do
Oh, sometimes I wonder
What my poor wife and child's gon' do
Hey, don't you make me mistreat them, darling
Whoa, I'm madly with you
[Outro]
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
Mhm-hmm, you shook me all night long
