[Verse 1]
I got a little woman I can really love
My woman fit me like a little glove
You know I'll always love
My little woman love
[Verse 2]
I take her home most every night
Oh, my woman love to hold me tight
You know I feel alright
My little woman mine
[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
I got a little woman I can really love
Oh, my woman fit me like a little glove
You know I'll always love
My little woman love
[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
I take her home most every night
My woman love to hold me tight
You know I feel alright
My little woman mine
[Outro]
Oh, little woman love
