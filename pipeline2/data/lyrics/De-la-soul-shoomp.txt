[Intro: Sean Paul]
Boom blah's round the world
And what's the cause if you don't know
De La Soul is dropping that
Turn that [?]
De La Soul, yo, yo
Turn the [?]
De La Soul now, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
[Verse 1: Posdnuos]
I'm not rehearsed or well versed in politic dissent
I just say what I mean so you know what I meant
We will not only squint, I'm like Clint
I'm from the east, will you at least acknowledge the print?
Can't front on me dawg, I'm from the office of NY
My cubicle's LI, home of the infamous Ice-T and sullies that roll
Play the DL on the ATL
Get the P for free when in DC
The ladies love me (For sure)
Pеaceful types of thugs bug me
Comе on peace manufacturing and fracturing yah
Next capturing yah
Checked facts will bring yah
I roll with spice everytime we up for cookin'
Gourmet plate, the place stay bookin'
But here they steady looking in awe, jaws wide
If they told you any different, believe me they all lie
Swallow your pride
Cause your beef is shipped like all dated
Yeah nigga, your love for us soon come like grey hair
Don't be a part of the problem we solvin'
Play like the dog and sit where we sit
Stay there[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Yo, yo [?] De La Soul

With the lyrical flow

Yo, yo De La Soul

[Verse 2: Trugoy]
Ayo, I'm aiming for this paper
Put my struggles on fry
[?] out of a baby girl and put her on a diet
Led riots in Time Square, the time there
Hustle y'all, get money, pay high rent
Spent one tenth of my life in time bent
Back like yo composers, I replied [?]
Invited they in, from the cheap [?] and [free spoke?]
Had me thinkin, popa's is the top of the block
Mob town we [?] next to just rock
This is federal rap and your mic can get tapped
Fifteen, dealin' on eBay, [?] menage, Nexus
The true way's been overexposed
Rappers ain't nothin' but advertised hoes
We get checks but we need to get checked
Put the brand next to me off of that [?]
How we usually, broke
Poke fun of that, hope we [?]
Pulling out like we ain't [?] the condom
[?] the condom
Sippin the condom
Layin' down with [?]
Gon' rip the condom[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Yo, yo [?] De La Soul
