Oh daddy, you know you make me cry
How can you love me?
I don’t understand why
Oh daddy, if I could make you see
If there’s been a fool around, it’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me
Oh daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You’re letting me know
You’re the best thing in my life
Oh daddy, if I could make you see
If there’s been a fool around, it’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me
Why are you right when I’m so wrong?
I’m so weak, but you’re so strong (You’re so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can’t walk away from you
Baby, if I try
Why are you right when I’m so wrong?
I’m so weak, but you’re so strong (Felt so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can’t walk away from you
Baby, if I try
Oh daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You’re letting me know
You’re the best thing in my life
Oh daddy, if I could make you see
If there’s been a fool around, it’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me
Yes, it’s got to be me
