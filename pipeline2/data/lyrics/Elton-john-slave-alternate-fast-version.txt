[Verse 1]
There's a river running sweat right through our land, through our land
Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand, in his hand
And I've taken just as much as I can stand, I can stand
Oh we've got to free our brothers from their shackles if we can, if we can
[Verse 2]
Most nights I have to watch my woman cry, won't you cry
Every day I watch the colonel smile, oh he smiles
His painted ladies riding in from town, in from town
Oh, I swear one day I'm gonna burn that whorehouse to the ground, to the ground
[Chorus]
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave
[Verse 3]
There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come, yet to come
That may free our families free our and our sons, and our sons
It can lay green lands to waste the barren wastes of the wastes
Oh, the price of release is a bitter blow to face of the face
[Chorus]
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
SlaveSlave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave
