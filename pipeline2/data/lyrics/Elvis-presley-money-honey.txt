[Verse 1]
You know the landlord rang my front doorbell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I went to the window, I peeped through the blind
And asked him to tell me what's on his mind
[Chorus]
He said, "Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me"
[Verse 2]
Well, I screamed and I hollered, I was so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I loved the best
I finally got my baby about half-past three
She said, "I'd like to know what you want with me"
[Chorus]
I said, "Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me"
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Well, I said, "Tell me, baby, what's wrong with you?"
"From this day on our romance is through"
I said, "Tell me, baby, face to face
How could another man take my place?"
[Chorus]
She said, "Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me"[Verse 4]
Well, I've learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow
The women may come and the women may go
But before I say "I love you so"
[Chorus]
I want money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me
