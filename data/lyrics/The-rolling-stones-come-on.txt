[Verse 1]
Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted
All day long I'm walkin' 'cause I couldn't get my car started
Laid off from my job and I can't afford to check it
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it
[Chorus]
Come on
Since me and my baby parted
Come on
I can't get started
Come on
I can't afford to check
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it
[Verse 2]
Everything is wrong since I've been without you
Every night I lay awake thinkin' about you
Every time the phone rings it sounds like thunder
Some stupid guy tryin' to reach another number
[Chorus]
Come on
Since I've been without you
Come on
Always thinkin' about you
Come on
Phone sounds like thunder
Some stupid guy tryin' to reach another number
[Verse 3]
Everything is wrong since I last saw you, baby
I really wanna see you and I don't mean maybe
I'm doin' everything tryin' to make you see
That I belong to you, hon, and you belong to me
[Chorus]
Come on
I wanna see you, baby
Come on
I don't mean maybe
Come on
I'm tryin' to make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to meCome on
I gotta see you, baby
Come on
I don't mean maybe
Come on
I've gotta make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me
[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
