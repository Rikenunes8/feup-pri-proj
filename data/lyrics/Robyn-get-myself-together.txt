[Verse 1]
It's all over like steps in the first snow (First snow)
Something's been building up and it's gonna blow (Blow)
My momma called me last night, she said
"When nothing else fits, pick up the pieces and move on" (On)
I see the flashing red lights, just can't make sense of the bits
It's like my mind is gone
[Chorus]
I got, got to get, get my head back on
I got, got to get myself together
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
I got, got to get
Can't tell what's right or wrong
I wish that something could be done
I'm not that clever
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
[Verse 2]
Can't stand to see you upset, but you already know
The more close it gets, the less I wanna go
I saw my brother last night, he said
"I know you too well, you can't pretend that nothing's wrong" (Wrong)
I see the fuse that ignites like I'm outside of myself
It's like my mind is gone
[Chorus]
I got, got to get, get my head back on
I got, got to get myself together
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
I got, got to get
Can't tell what's right or wrong
I wish that something could be done
I'm not that clever
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
[Bridge]
My daddy pulled me aside, like when I was a child
He said, "I trust you, decide on what you know is right
And for whatever it's worth, I am on your side" (Ooh)
There's no denying the mess that I got us in
And I've been tryin' my best not to make a scene
Just can't make sense of it all, it's like my mind is gone (Gone)[Chorus]
I got, got to get, get my head back on
I got, got to get myself together (Myself together)
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
I got, got to get
Can't tell what's right or wrong
I wish that something could be done
I'm not that clever
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
I got, got to get
Can't tell what's right or wrong
I wish that something could be done
I'm not that clever
I got, got to get
When this hurt is gone, I got, got to get myself together
