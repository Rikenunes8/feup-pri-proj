You got your words
But they make you stuck
Now you can't feel
Now you can't want
It's just too messy
It's just too thick
Is it too scary
Is it too real
It is one desire
Burning hot and bright
It could fill up the sky
It could fill me up
You write it down
You strategize
Never go over
Your little lines
But I'll breathe the air
I'll stop the clock
I'll touch the sky
And say what I want
It is one desire
Burning hot and bright
It could fill up the sky
It could fill me up
Worth the trouble, worth the pain
It is brave to feel
It is brave to be alive
