[Verse 1]
In this life... of... happiness and sadness (Alright)
When you've lost... out on love... (I know)
And it all... ends up in madness (Play that horn)
And you say, "Love, please go away. Don't torture me night and day."
Then something that's real...
Someone you feel comes in
[Chorus]
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody who says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
[Verse 2]
Once again... Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...
She's so wonderful
I tried not to let my heart step in
But what to do, baby
What could I do
When somebody real comes in
Someone who feel comes in
[Chorus]
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody
She says she love me
I'm falling in love again
Oh, beautiful woman
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Falling in love
The world's so great, baby
So love me
As though there was no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
So let's have a toast and whisper
See you later
I love you
I love you, baby
I love youLet's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
