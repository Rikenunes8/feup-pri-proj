I keep tryna run away in my sleep
Let another year go by (Let another year go by)
I'm driving deep into the night, I'm blinded
Guided by a dim headlight (Guided by a dim headlight)

I'm giving it up, everything that I'm scared of
God only knows how hard I've tried
I really hope that I can get better
Wonderin' what's on the other side
I'm over my head tellin' me
That I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Every time I find a piece
The picture makes no sense to me
Everybody pushin' me, I just need space
Everybody sayin' that I'll find my way
I don't really know if it'll be okay
But everybody's tellin' me it's just a phase

It's just a phase

Eyes closed, walkin' through my life with a blindfold
Wonder when the work pays off (Wonder when the work pays off)
Oh, wasting precious time, barely getting by
So tell me it's right

That I'm giving it up, everything that I'm scared of
God only knows how hard I've tried
I really hope that I can get better
Wonderin' what's on the other side

I'm over my head tellin' me
That I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Every time I find a piece
The picture makes no sense to me
Everybody pushin' me, I just need space
Everybody sayin' that I'll find my way
I don't really know if it'll be okay
But everybody's tellin' me it's just a phase
It's just a phase
(It's just a phase)
(It's just a phase)

Sick and tired of the time I'm wastin'
Holed up, dyin' in my basement
Tryna manage all the expectations
Why does everybody test my patience?
Sick and tired of the time I'm wastin'

It's just a phase (It's just a phase)
(It's just a phase)
Everybody's tellin' me it's just a phase (It's just a phase)
(It's just a phase)
It's just a phase (It's just a phase)
It's just a phase
(It's just a phase)
(It's just a phase)
