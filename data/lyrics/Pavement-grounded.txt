[Verse 1]
Doctor's leaving for the holiday season
Got crystal ice picks
, 
no gift for the gab
And in the parking lot, is the sedan he bought
He never, he never complains when it's hot
[Chorus]
He foaled a swollen daughter in the sauna playing contract bridge
They're soaking up the fauna, doing blotters,
 
I don't know which...which...which
Boys are dying on these streets
[Verse 2]
I know the medical world could knock you out
To sell the coins that you jayed last Thursday-hey
Dine by candlelight, and hold your savings tight
You never, you never know when the bridge falls apart
[Chorus]
He spoke of latent causes, sterile gauzes, and the bedside morale
He traipse around the table
 talking sentences so incomplete...plete....plete
Boys are dying on these streets
