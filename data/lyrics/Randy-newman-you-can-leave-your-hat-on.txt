[Verse 1]
Baby, take off your coat
Real slow
Baby, take off your shoes
Here, I'll take your shoes
Baby, take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes
[Chorus]
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
[Verse 2]
Go on over there and turn on the light
No, all the lights
Now come back here and stand on this chair
That's right
Raise your arms up in to the air
Shake 'em
[Chorus]
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
[Verse 3]
Suspicious minds are talking
Trying to tear us apart
They say that my love is wrong
[Chorus]
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
I know what love is
