[Verse 1: Black Francis & Kim Deal]
As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile, it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed
[Chorus: Black Francis & Kim Deal]
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
[Verse 2: Black Francis & Kim Deal]
Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes
[Chorus: Black Francis & Kim Deal]
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
[Bridge: Kim Deal]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[Verse 3: Black Francis & Kim Deal]
There's a place in the buried west
In a cave with a house in it
In the clay, the holes of hands
You can place a hand in hand
[Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
]
I bleed (
I bleed
)
I bleed (
I bleed
)
I bleed (
I bleed
)
