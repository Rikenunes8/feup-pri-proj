[Chorus 1]
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
[Verse 1]
You brought a lot of money
But me, I'm catching tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you undermine me, uh-huh
And I start to be sensible
If you know what I mean
[Chorus 2]
And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away
[Post-Chorus 1]
And next time, we'll talk it over
And we can start again, shock
[Verse 2]
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
What, what, what, what
What did you think would happen next?
What, what, what, what
What could it ever be?
[Chorus 2]
So it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away
[Post-Chorus 1]
And next time, let's talk about it
Or maybe start again, shock[Bridge]
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
[Post-Chorus 2]
Next time we could talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
You know what I'm saying?
I knew you were low, man
But the truth is, I was shocked
[Outro]
Fun, power, eyes
Eyes never lie
Kids ("Hey, buddy?" "What?")
Kids never lie
