[Verse 1]
Well, all right, Starchild
Citizens of the universe, recording angels
We have returned to claim the pyramids
Partying on the mothership
I am the mothership connection
[Verse 2]
Gettin' down in 3D, light year groovin'
All right, hear any noise
Ain't nobody but me and the boys
Gettin' down, hit it fellas
[Chorus]
If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
All right, all right, starchild here
[Verse 3]
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the Mothership
Loose booty, doin' the bump
Hustle on over here
[Chorus]
Ain't nothing but a party, y'all
[Verse 4]
Face it even your memory banks
Have forgotten this funk
Mothership connection
Home of the p. funk, the bomb
[Chorus]
Doin' it in 3DLet me put on my sunglasses here
So I can see what I'm doing
[Verse 5]
When you hear seats rumble
You will hear your conscience grumble
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
You have overcome for I am here
[Bridge]
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
[Verse 6]
Are you hip to Easter Island?
The Bermuda Triangle?
Well, all right
Ain't nothing but a party
[Verse 7]
Starchild here, citizens of the universe
I bring forth to you
The good time on the mothership
Are you hip? Sing, fellas[Chorus]
[Verse 8]
Starchild here, doin' it in 3D
So good, it's good to me
Hit the band
[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming forth to carry you home
[Chorus]
[Verse 9]
Swing low, time to move on
Light years in time, ahead of our time
Free your mind and come fly
With me, it's hip on the mothership groovin'
[Bridge]
