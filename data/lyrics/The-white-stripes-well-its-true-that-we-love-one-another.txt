[Chorus: Holly Golightly, 
Jack White
 & 
Both
]
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you
[Verse 1: Holly Golightly & 
Jack White
]
Jack, give me some money to pay my bills
All the dough I give you, Holly, you've been using on pain pills
Jack, will you call me if you're able?
I got your phone number written in the back of my Bible
[Verse 2: Holly Golightly & 
Meg White
]
Jack, I think you're pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?
You know I don't care, 'cause Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now?
Well I would, but Meg, I really just don't know how
[Verse 3: 
Jack White,
 
Meg White
 & 
Holly Golightly & Jack White
]
Just say, “Jack, do you adore me?”
Well I would Holly, but love really bores me
Then I guess we should just be friends
I'm just kidding Holly, you know that I'll love you 'til the end
[Chorus: Holly Golightly, 
Jack White
 & 
Both
]
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you
[Verse 4: Holly Golighty, 
Jack White,
 & 
Meg White
]
Holly give me some of your English lovin'
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and love yourself?
If I did that Holly, there won't be anything left for anybody else
Jack, it's too bad about the way that you look
You know I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot
Will the two of you cut it out?
And tell 'em what it's really all about[Chorus: Holly Golightly, 
Jack White
 & 
Both
]
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you
