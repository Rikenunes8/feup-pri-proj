This is Anna's song
Ah, making love all night long
Take a bath in milk, and lay on your satin sheets
Laugh and smile and(Oh oh)
Lay a while and(Oh oh)
Chocolate mint, candy sweets
(Laying across the bed)
(Laying across the bed, laying across the bed)
This is Anna's song
(This is Anna's song, this is Anna's song)
Keep on singing (Loving my song)
All night long (Loving my song)
Oooh work so hard, see me make a dollar
(Never worked so hard)
I know I should for my own good
"What's it, husband, makes you so stubborn?"
And oh
Didn't you notice the snow, starting to fall
Come let us sit a while, just listen
To the children laughing and running wild
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!Yeah this is Anna's song - hey baby
Hey baby, loving you all night long
Let it happen again and again and again baby and again
She's a child of the sun, lovingest one of all
Mmm and this is Anna's song yeah
Keep on loving me baby loving me 'cross the hall
She can't do no wrong 'cause this is Anna's song
Laugh and shed a tear, kiss me, Anna dear
Ooohhhh baby
Hey Anna, here's your song yeah
The one that I promise baby, promise you all along
I knew all the time that I'd find the rhyme
Never have a fear, here it is, my dear
