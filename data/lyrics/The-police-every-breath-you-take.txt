[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you
[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?
[Verse 2]
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
[Bridge]
Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please
[Middle-Eight]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take[Verse 3]
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
