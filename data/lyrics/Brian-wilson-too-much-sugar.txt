Too much sugar and too much cake
You'll end up with a bellyache
Take that greasy steak and fries
Slap that fat right on your thighs
Don't be stupid now, use your brain
Start to stretch and muscle ache
Eat your veggies and whole grain too
Fruits and fibre will nourish you
Take those legs and make them run
When you're fit it's much more fun
Getting in shape is what it's all about
Don't you just feel it's true
Move it all around just like Jane Fonda now
Then there'll be a brand new you
Stuff you eat can poison you
Make you feel real lazy too
Drugs you take make you insane
All they do is burn your brain
One two three four kick 'em high
Join a gym or visit the Y
Five six seven eight feeling fine
You can live 'til 99
Getting in shape is what it's all about
Don't you just feel it's true
Move it all around just like Jane Fonda now
Then there'll be a brand new you
Hey, my mama's been cooking good
Long time eating the way I should
Alright!
Getting in shape is what it's all about
Don't you just feel it's true
Move it all around just like Jane Fonda now
Then there'll be a brand new youToo much sugar and too much cake
You'll end up with a bellyache
Take that greasy steak and fries
Slap that fat right on your thighs
