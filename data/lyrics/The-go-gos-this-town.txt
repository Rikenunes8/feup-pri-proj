[Verse 1]
We all know the chosen toys
Of catty girls and pretty boys
Make up that face
Jump in the race
Life's a kick in this town
Life's a kick in this town
[Chorus]
This town is our town
(This town) It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us
This town is our town
(This town) It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us
[Verse 2]
Change the lines that were said before
We're all dreamers - we're all whores
Discarded stars
Like worn out cars
Litter the streets of this town
Litter the streets of this town
[Chorus]
This town is our town
(This town) It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us
This town is our town
(This town) It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
This town is our town
(This town) It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us
This town, it's our town
(This town) It is so glamorous
I bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us[Outro]
This town
This town
This town
This town
