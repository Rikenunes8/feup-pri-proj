[Intro]
Oooh Doggies!
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh!
[Verse 1]
We want to play in the sunshine
We want to be free
Without the help of a Margarita or Ecstasy
We want to kick like we used to
Sign up on the dotted line
We going to dance every dance
Like it's going to be the last time
We got to play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up to 10
I want to meet you (meet you), kiss you (kiss you)
Love you (love you), and miss you (miss you)
Do it all over again, do it all over again
[Chorus]
We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm going to have fun[Verse 2]
Play in the sunshine
We going to love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're going to rock him
We're going to roll him
We're going to teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)
Aah, pop goes the music
When the big white rabbit begin to talk
And the colour green will make your best friends leave ya
It will make them do the walk
But that's cool
Cuz one day, everyday will be a yellow day/holiday
And let's play
[Chorus]
We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm going to have fun
We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm going to have fun[Outro]
(play), (play)
(play) no, (play) no, (play) no
(come on, play) no!, (play) no!, (play play play) Yes!
Drummer, do your thing
Drummer, drummer, do your thing
Drummer, drummer, drummer
Can I get some of that?
Wait  minute!
Da da da da da, da da
Let's get out of here (yeah)
(lalalalalalala play, laugh in the sunshine)
We're not afraid to (play, laugh in the sunshine)
We are going to
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
La la la
