[Intro]
Hey!
[Verse 1]
Yeah, kid, it's a-really hip
With plenty of flash and you know it
Yeah, dad, you're rocking real bad
Don't break your neck when you fall down laughing
Donna, wanna, Donna
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I know, I look like hell
Smoke and I drink and I'm feeling swell
Yeah, I hear you think it's weird
But I don't give a single shit
[Verse 2]
Yeah, man, it's a hippie old saying
It's a hippie old saying and I hear it
My heart aches, it's a-looking for a dolly
Looking for a dolly, can't you hear it?
Wanna be something
Wanna be anything
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I know I feel this way
But I ain't gonna never change
Yeah, I hear, I think, I know
Rock don't give a shit, you know
[Hook]
You're my favorite thing
You're my favorite thing
Bar nothing!
[Guitar Solo]
[Hook]
[?]
You're my favorite thing
You're my favorite thing
You're my
You're mine
You're mine
You're mine[Outro]
I think big, I think big
I think big once in a while
I think big, I think big
I think big once in a while
I think, think, think, I think, think, think
I think, think, I think once in a while
