[Verse 1]
If there's heaven
There's a place for us
There's a teenage dream
And my love's enough
But when I break into sapphires
I've cost you more than myself
I've no more strength than Ulysses
I've no more stake than the night bird's call
[Chorus]
Cold, the mornings lie awake
Not so afraid, but droll
Cold, receding
Cold, prevailing
Cold, preceding
One dark road to go
[Verse 2]
If there's heaven
There's a wrath so just
Near the kiln that roars
Into love like dust (Like dust)
But when I break, I stay broken
I'd sooner avenge my daughter's breath
But I've no more strength than the Watchman
And I've no more luck than Circe's jest[Chorus]
Cold, the mornings lie awake
Not so afraid, but droll
Cold, receding
Cold, prevailing
Cold, preceding
One dark road to go
[Bridge]
(To go, to go)
Go where you'd know (You'd know, you'd know)
Set where you'd fight
On one dark road
Go (You gotta go)
Go where you'd know (You'd know, you'd know)
Set where you'd fight
On one dark road
[Outro]
Cold, the mornings rouse awake
Not so afraid, but cold
It's read, the unknowns ebb away
If I asked, wait
Would you know cold?
