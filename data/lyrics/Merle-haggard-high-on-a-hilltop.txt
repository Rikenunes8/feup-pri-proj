[Verse 1]
High on a hilltop overlooking the city
I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you're dancing in some dingy barroom
And the lure of the gayness takes the place of our dream
[Chorus]
High on a hilltop, my heart cries, "Oh Lord"
Forgive her, she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and someday
High on a hilltop, together we'll pray
[Verse 2]
I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
With a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger 'cause you're silly with booze
And from high on a hilltop, I see the devil in you
[Chorus]
High on a hilltop, my heart cries, "Oh Lord"
Forgive her, she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and someday
High on a hilltop, together we'll pray
