Start to move
Time at hand
Bird in hand
No bush but trees thicken
Which now, rooster or chicken?
Leave the past
Feel the wrench
Smell the stench
Was good, but flesh soon rots
Emotions, we all got spots
Please believe me, I still do care
Please believe me, I'm just not there
Please believe me, honestly, I swear
Please believe me
Oh well, please believe me
Please believe me
Please believe me
Please believe me
Oh well, please believe me
Please believe me
I swear
I
Swear
