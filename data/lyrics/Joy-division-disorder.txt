[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide
To come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel
The pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults
Leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling
Take the shock away
[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster now
It's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs
Into no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing
Getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling
Let it out somehow
[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me
And we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her
I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell
And who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know
[Outro]
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling
