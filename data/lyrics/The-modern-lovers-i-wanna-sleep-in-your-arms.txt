You know I never can relax
I'm always stiff and tense
I gotta to sleep in your arms
Wrap me up in your hands
I'll finally feel calm
And finally just relax
You know the world is cold and hard
I gotta to sleep in your arms
You gotta keep each other warm
I gotta to sleep in your arms
I gotta to sleep in your arms
Wrap me up in your hands
I'll finally feel calm
And finally just relax
You know I'm ok on my own
But I've been so long alone
I gotta to sleep in your arms
Wrap me up in your hands
I'll finally feel calm
And finally just relax
You know the world is cold and hard
I gotta to sleep in your arms
Let's dream walk hand in hand
I gotta to sleep in your arms
I gotta to sleep in your arms
Wrap me up in your hands
I'll finally feel calm
And finally just relax
I gotta to sleep in your arms
Wrap me up in your hands
I'll finally feel calm
And finally just relax
