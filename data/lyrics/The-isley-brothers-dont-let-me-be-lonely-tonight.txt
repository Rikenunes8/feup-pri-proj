[Chorus]
Do me wrong, do me right, do me right, baby
Tell me lies but hold, hold me tight
And save your goodbyes 'til the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
[Verse 1]
Say goodbye, woman, say hello, hello, hello
Sure enough good to see you, oh, but it's time to go
Don't say yes, but please, don't say no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Go away then damn you
Go and do as you please, go and do as you please, girl
You ain't gonna see me gettin' down on my knees
'Cause I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turnin' my world upside down, oh babe
[Chorus]
Do me wrong, do me right, right now, baby
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
[Outro]
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
Lord, I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
Don't let me be lonely tonight
Don't do it, baby
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
