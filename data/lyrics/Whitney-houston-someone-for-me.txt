[Verse 1]
(Someone for me)
(Someone for me)
I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio, and me
Really ain't been getting along
I wish that I could find a way
To party to the break of day
And there I'd be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me
Then momma comes and asks me
Why I am dreaming, sitting alone
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever
Find someone for me
While I am young and seventeen
[Chorus]
Someone for me (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
Someone (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
[Verse 2]
Now there's a party down at Angie's house
With people packed against the walls
I'm sitting in a corner here
Trying to make sense of it all
And when I least expect it
Meeting a guy I see in my dreams
Here he is walking up to me
And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I found someone for me
[Chorus]
Someone for me (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
Someone (someone for me)
I've got to find someone
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
And so I'm finding out that
Dreams you believe in, can come to be
And now I'm looking up to find that joy
And happiness can come to you and me
I actually found someone for me[Chorus]
Someone for me (someone for me)
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
(Someone for me)
Someone for me, Someone for me
Someone
(Someone for me)
Someone, someone, someone
Someone, someone, someone for me
(Someone for me)
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, yeah, yeah
(Someone for me)
Oh, I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
(Someone for me)
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone (someone for me)
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody
Someone, somebody for me
(Someone for me)
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody for me
(Someone for me)
