[Verse 1]
Till the morning comes, it'll do you fine
Till the morning comes, like a highway sign
Showing you the way, leaving no doubt
Of the way on in or the way back out
[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
[Verse 2]
Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine
Don't think about what you left behind
The way you came or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow
[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
[Verse 3]
When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow, it'll ease your mind
The shape it takes could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose
[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy[Outro]
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
