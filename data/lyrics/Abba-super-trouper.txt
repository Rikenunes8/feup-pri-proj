[Intro: Frida & Agnetha]
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you
[Verse 1: Frida]
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)
[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, 
Benny & Björn
]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you[Verse 2: Frida]
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)
[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, 
Benny & Björn
]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
[Bridge: Frida]
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, 
Benny & Björn
]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
[Outro: Frida & Agnetha, 
Benny & Björn
]
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
 Lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do… 
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
