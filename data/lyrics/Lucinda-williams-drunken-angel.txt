[Verse 1]
Sun came up it was another day
And the sun went down you were blown away
Why'd you let go of your guitar
Why'd you ever let it go that far
Drunken angel
[Verse 2]
Could've held on to that long smooth neck
Let your hand remember every fret
Fingers touching each shiny string
But you let go of everything
Drunken angel
[Chorus]
Drunken angel
You're on the other side
Drunken angel
You're on the other side
[Verse 3]
Followers would cling to you
Hang around just to meet you
Some threw roses at your feet
And watch you pass out on the street
Drunken angel
[Verse 4]
Feed you and pay off all your debts
Kiss your brow taste your sweat
Write about your soul your guts
Criticize you and wish you luck
Drunken angel
[Chorus]
Drunken angel
You're on the other side
Drunken angel
You're on the other side[Verse 5]
Some kind of savior singin' the blues
A derelict in your duct tape shoes
Your orphan clothes and your long dark hair
Looking like you didn't care
Drunken angel
[Verse 6]
Blood spilled out from the hole in your heart
Over the strings of your guitar
The worn down places in the wood
The ones that made you feel so good
Drunken angel
[Chorus]
Drunken angel
You're on the other side
Drunken angel
You're on the other side
[Verse 7]
Sun came up it was another day
And the sun went down you were blown away
Why'd you let go of your guitar
Why'd you ever let it go that far
Drunken angel
Drunken angel
