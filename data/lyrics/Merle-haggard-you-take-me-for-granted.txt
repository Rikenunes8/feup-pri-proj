My legs and my feet have walked till they can't hardly move
From trying to please you
And my back is sore from bending over backwards
To just lay the world at your door
And I'm trying hard to put a smile on a sad face
While deep down it's breaking my heart
And as sure as the sun shines, I'll be a lifetime
Not knowing if I've done my part
'Cause you take me for granted
And it's breaking my heart
And as sure as the sun shines, I'll be a lifetime
Not knowing if I've done my part
And as sure as the sun shines, I'll be a lifetime
Not knowing if I've done my part
