[Verse 1]
Two states
We want two states
North and south
Two, two states
[Chorus]
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
[Verse 2]
Two states
We want two states
There's no culture
There's no spies
[Chorus]
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
Forty million daggers
