[Intro]
Whoo!
Whoo!
[Verse 1]
Out of my mind on Saturday night
1970 rollin' in sight
Radio burnin' up above
Beautiful baby, feed my love
[Chorus]
All night 'til I blow away
All night 'til I blow away
I feel alright, I feel alright
[Post-Chorus]
Whoo!
[Verse 2]
Baby, oh baby, burn my heart
Baby, oh baby, burn my heart
Fall apart, babe, fall apart
Baby, oh baby, burn my heart
[Chorus]
All night 'til I blow away
All night 'til I blow away
I feel alright, I feel alright
[Post-Chorus]
Feel alright, feel alright, feel alright
Whoo!
[Verse 1]
Out of my mind on Saturday night
1970 rollin' in sight
Radio burnin' up above
Beautiful baby, feed my love
[Breakdown]
All night 'til I blow away
All night 'til I blow away
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel! Feel! Blow! Blow!
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Blow! Blow! I feel alright
Feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
So... Whoo! So...
