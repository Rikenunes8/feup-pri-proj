Had it all and ya' didn’t know
Hadda' try for a little more
Baby gets me down , when you lead me 'round
And we come up nowhere
Oh
Well it’s half mine and it’s half yours
Got half of what I deserve
Baby you were so cool , when you were in school
How’d you come up nowhere?
And baby I feel nothin' but an empty room
You'll see you’ll be lonely too
Honey you tell me what I'm supposed to do
I’ve got all this time invested in you
Did you walk me through hell just to finally break through?
To nowhere
To nowhere
Well it’s half mine and it’s half yours
I got half of what I deserve
Baby you were so cool , when you were in school
And it gets me down when you lead me 'round
And you come up nowhere
You come up nowhere(Producer Jimmy Iovine speaking)
Alright, that's fantastic
(Petty)
That was the best one
(Iovine)
That's fantastic...
