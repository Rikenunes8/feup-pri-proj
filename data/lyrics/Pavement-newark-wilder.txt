[Verse 1]
Lane driver
The forces against you, the rain
I know everybody wants to put you down but
I know everybody's gonna put me down
, 
I want you
[Chorus 1]
Because I'm rushing to feel you
But I won't set you down
I don't need to
Because I'm rushing to feel you
But I won't set you down
I don't need to
[Verse 2]
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Don't try, try, try, try, try
It's a brand new era, it feels great
It's a brand new era but it came too late
[Chorus 2]
She won't let you know that
I need a right to touch her
She won't let you wait for me
For me to touch you
[Bridge]
Crowds of the people
And voices and steeples and wedding rings
Wild are the horses and break-up divorces and separate rooms from
[Verse 3]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
I love your tinted eyes
So bad, so bad, so so bad, so bad
[Chorus 3]
She won't let me break you out
When the picture's cut in
Three of us, that is enough
And the simple stuff I need
Can't you see the stuff I need?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you stuff me, stuff me?
