Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes, I am
I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland
Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor

Little German boy
In a German town

I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland
Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes, I am
I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland

Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German
