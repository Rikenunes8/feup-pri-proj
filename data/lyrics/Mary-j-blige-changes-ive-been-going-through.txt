[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you
[Verse 1]
It’s all gone, the moment that we shared is gone away
Maybe it’s better that we didn’t stay together
Seems like we’ve gone through this a thousand times
Baby, I still don’t have the answer
Why can't you tell me why we couldn’t be together?
[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you?
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
[Verse 2]
See, I didn’t want to ever want to cry
But still I need love and affection
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention?
Tell me, baby, did I push you away?
Was I coming on strong for you?
Why can’t you tell me, tell me what am I to do?[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you?
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
[Interlude]
Don't you wanna be with me?
Don't you wanna be with me?
Don't you wanna be with me?
[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you
[Outro]
So why can’t ya see?
Pretty baby, can’t you see that I wanna be with you?
