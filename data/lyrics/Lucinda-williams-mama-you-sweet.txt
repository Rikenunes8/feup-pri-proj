I love you, Mama you sweet
I love you, Mama you sweet
I love you, Mama you sweet
I love you, Mama you sweet
I love you, Mama you sweet
With an ocean in my spirit
And cracks on my lips
And scars in my heart
And this burden on my hips
Ocean becomes heavy and tries
To push its way out
Through these ancient eyes
And the memories in my mouth
Ocean becomes tears
That ebb and flow
Over the lines in my face
And the pain in my soul
And pain hits a wall
And doesn't know which way to go
And ocean says I'm crying now
And tells pain to follow
And pain courses through
Every vein, every limb
Trying to find a way out
Between the secrets in my skin
And secrets hold on
Until they finally give in
And they meet up with ocean
And tears again
And tears hand me a shovel
Saying break beneath the crust
That binds earthly skin
And buries all the trustSomehow trust was caught
Between the cracks on my lips
And the scars in my heart
And this burden on my hips
I love you, Mama you sweet...
