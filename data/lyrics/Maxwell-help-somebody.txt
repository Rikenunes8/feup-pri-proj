[Verse 1]
There's a moving inner peace that I love to see
Gotta raise my soul to tell you how I feel
Gotta listen to the tears that people cry for me
In a world that's so wild fear creeps
Cause when I get up to hear you, tears just fill my eyes
Now I know I got to let the selfishness subside
Tell 'em y'all
[Chorus]
Helpsomebody, helpsomebody
Show 'em what it is, give a little bit more
Helpsomebody, helpsomebody
Show 'em what it is, let 'em know
[Interlude]
If you see the future, ask it if I'm there
Ask it if I'm there
[Verse 2]
Ask it to tell you did I ever make a stand
Ask if you may care to mention, did I learn from everything?
And even if it takes a sea of eternity to know
I'll wait a century, a buried mess of bones, help meHelp me to give myself the way that you've given you
Help me to be the helping hand that makes a dream come true
Choir, sing
[Chorus]
Helpsomebody, helpsomebody
Show 'em what it is, give a little bit more
Helpsomebody, helpsomebody
Show 'em what it is, let 'em know
[Bridge]
If I'm there, yea
Tell me if I'm there
Do you see me there?
Do you see me there?
[Chorus]
Helpsomebody, helpsomebody
Show 'em what it is, give a little bit more
Helpsomebody, helpsomebody
Show 'em what it is, let 'em know
[Outro]
If you see the future, ask it if I'm there
Ask it if I'm there
