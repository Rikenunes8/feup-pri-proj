[Verse 1]
Turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtains
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)
I got this message for you girl
But it seems I was never on time
Still I gotta get through to you girl
On time, on time (word)
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good loving
(Uh, uh, right, uh)
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah I want to give you some good, good loving (uh)
[Verse 2]
Turn your lights down low
Never ever try to resist, oh no
Let my love come tumbling in
Into our lives again
And ooh, I love you
(I love you, I love you)
And I want you to know right now
(Know right now)
Ooh I love you
(Uh-uh, yeah, uh)
And I want you to know right now (uh)
Because I, that I
I want to give you some love (uh, yeah)
I want to give you some good, good loving
Oh I
I want to give you some good, good loving
[Outro]
I want to give you some good, good loving
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good loving
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I want to give you some good, good loving
