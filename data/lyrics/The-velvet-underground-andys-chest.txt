[Verse 1]
If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here, they were a bit cuckoo
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
[Chorus]
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains bolder after you?
[Verse 2]
If I could be any one of the things in the world that bite
Instead of an endangered ocelot on a leash, I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string, flying in the air at night
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy-minded pink bare bear
[Chorus 2]
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And all the stones are erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you
[Verse 3]
Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving on the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
[Pre-Chorus 3]
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose[Chorus 3]
And all the curtains laced with diamonds for you
And all the Roman noblemen for you
And kingdom's Christian sailors, dear, for you
And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats, that with a kiss, turn prince for you
[Outro]
Swoop, swoop
Rock, rock
Roll, roll
Swoop, swoop
Rock, rock
Roll, roll
Swoop, swoop
Rock, rock
