[Verse 1]
Well, it's a god-given fact
That you can't go back, no you can't go back
It's a god-given law
That you're gonna lose your maw, yes, you're gonna lose your maw
Well, it's a god-given fact
You gotta buy 'em by the sack, gotta buy 'em by the sack
Well, it's a god-given law
That you're gonna get small, yes you're gonna get small
[Verse 2]
Maybe just another rap
But you're running out of sap, yes, you're running out of sap
Well, you'd better take the rap
Dying under daddy's cap, dying under daddy's cap
[Chorus]
Shrivel up
[Verse 3]
It's at the top of the list
That you can't get pissed, no you can't get pissed
It's rule number one
Living right isn't fun, living right isn't fun
Cause it's a god-given fact
That you can't go back, no, you can't go back
It's a god-given law
That you're gonna lose your maw, yes, you're gonna lose your maw
Time-tested and true
You gotta pooty, poo-poo, gotta pooty, poo-poo
Well, it's a god-given law
That you're gonna get small, yes you're gonna get small
Maybe just another rap
But you're running out of sap, yes you're running out of sap
Well, you'd better take the rap
Dying under daddy's cap, dying under daddy's cap, now
[Chorus]
Oh, shrivel up
Shrivel up Devo!
