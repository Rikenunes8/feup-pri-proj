[Verse 1]
Fat Charlie the Archangel sloped into the room
He said, "I have no opinion about this
And I have no opinion about that"
Sad as a lonely little wrinkled balloon
He said, "Well I don't claim to be happy about this, boys
And I don't seem to be happy about that"
[Chorus]
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
[Verse 2]
She says she knows about jokes
This time the joke is on me
Well, I have no opinion about that
And I have no opinion about me
Somebody could walk into this room
And say, "Your life is on fire!
It's all over the evening news
All about the fire in your life on the evening news"
[Chorus]
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
[Verse 3]
Fat Charlie the Archangel files for divorce
He says, "Well this will eat up a year of my life
And then there's all that weight to be lost"
She says the joke is on me
I say the joke is on her
I said, "I have no opinion about that"
Well, we'll just have to wait and confer
[Chorus]
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
