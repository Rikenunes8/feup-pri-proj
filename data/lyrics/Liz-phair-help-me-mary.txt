[Verse 1]
Help me, Mary, please
I've lost my home to thieves
They bully the stereo and drink
They leave suspicious stains in the sink
They make rude remarks about me
They wonder just how wild I would be
[Refrain]
As they egg me on and keep me mad
They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that...
[Verse 2]
I lock my door at night
I keep my mouth shut tight
I practice all my moves
I memorize their stupid rules
I make myself their friend
I'll show them just how far I can bend
[Refrain]
As they egg me on and keep me mad
They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that...
[Verse 3]
I'm asking you, Mary, please
Temper my hatred with peace
Weave my disgust into fame
And watch how fast they run to the flame
