*Instrumental for What's the Difference by Dr. Dre (Ft. Eminem & Xzibit) plays in the background*
Aye!
Hey, Em, what's up?
Steve Berman, what's going on, man? How you doin'?
Good to see you again, what's up?
Em, could you come here and have a seat, please?
Umm, yeah, what's u-
Vanessa, shut the door
Okay, *door closes*
So, what's up?
How's orders lookin' for the first week?
It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
Wh-
This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record
Wha-
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Violet Brown told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violet-
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record
Shoved up your ass?
But I-
I'm gonna lose my fucking job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rapping about big-screen TV's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rapping about homosexuals and Vicodin
I mean...
I can't sell this shit!
What-
Either change the record or it's not comin' out!
What? I-
Now get the fuck out of my office!
What am I 'sposed-
Now!
*sigh* Alright, man-
