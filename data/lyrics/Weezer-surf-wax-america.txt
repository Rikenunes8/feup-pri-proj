[Verse 1]
The sea is foaming like a bottle of beer
The wave is coming, but I ain't got no fear
I'm waxing down, so that I'll go real fast
I'm waxing down, because it's really a blast
I'm going surfing, 'cause I don't like your face
I'm bailing out, because I hate the race
Of rats that run around and 'round in the maze
I'm going surfing, I'm going surfing
[Chorus]
You take your car to work, I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat
[Verse 2]
My buddies and their honeys all come along
They seem invincible as they trip along
The sea is rolling like a thousand pound keg
We're going surfing, going surfing
[Chorus]
You take your car to work, I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat
You take your car to work, I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat
[Bridge]
All along the undertow is strengthening its hold
I never thought it'd come to this, now I can never go home
All along the undertow is strengthening its hold
I never thought it'd come to this, now I can never go home
[Chorus]
You take your car to work, I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat
You take your car to work, I'll take my board
(All along the undertow is strengthening its hold)
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat
(I never thought it'd come to this, now I can never go home)[Outro]
You take your car to work, I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat
You take your car, I'll take my board
You take your car, I'll take my board, let's go
