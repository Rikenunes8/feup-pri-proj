[Verse 1]
Friends warehouse pain
Attack their own kind
A thousand kids bury their parents
[Chorus]
There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
[Verse 2]
We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement under the marquee
[Chorus]
There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio[Verse 3]
Friends warehouse pain
Attack their own kind
A thousand kids bury their parents
[Chorus]
There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
