[Verse 1]
Tomboy, Hail Mary
Never needs a dress to make her pretty
She's a killjoy, such a letdown
Daddy tried to raise a southern belle
Well, he got a tomboy
[Verse 2]
Tomboy in between
Dirt in her nails and holes in her jeans
She'll destroy all your dreams
And ride out like a rodeo queen
Know what I mean
She's a tomboy
[Chorus]
Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
She wears her scars outside her sleeves
Always has a way of saying "no way"
Some people don't get her but that's okay
[Post-Chorus]
Move along, boy
She's a tomboy
[Verse 3]
Barfly, bad betty
Band of brothers that got her back
She's unladylike, like a scout fire
Got her own constellation in the zodiac
Well, who can say that?
A tomboy
[Chorus]
Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
She's hard to love and hard to please
Always has a way of saying "no way"
Some people don't get her but that's okay
[Post-Chorus]
Move along, boy
She's a tomboy[Bridge]
She's got a softer side she'll never let you see
With tears in her eyes she'd rather be caught dead (Be caught dead)
Sweet contradiction with no guarantees
She is what she is, you get what you get (Oh, you get what you get)
[Outro]
Move along, boy
She's a tomboy
Or go along with it, boy
You got a tomboy
