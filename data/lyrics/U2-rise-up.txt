[Verse 1]
In a stairway on a stone walk
In a doorstep, golden light
In a cold wind blowing
In the danger, out of the storm
[Pre-Chorus]
I remain in you
I will recall this storm
This storm recalls you
[Chorus]
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
[Verse 2]
In the lands you have a garden
In the garden it's going dark
In the cold a wind blowing
In the cold wind blowing
I am in this doorway
Feel her in this doorway
Golden hills, golden memories
I follow the ocean wherever it goes[Pre-Chorus]
In the doorway I don't know where to start
Emotion in the cold
In the day, darkest night
In the darkest night I know
I stumble in these shoes
In the dark night
[Chorus]
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
[Outro]
Go in the lonely, lone
Loneliness a path to go
Only if you know
Our love helps me know
Your love will help me
Discover you beneath the thing
Only if you know
Only rise up, rise up
