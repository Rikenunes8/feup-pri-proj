[Verse 1]
I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was 32, lovely and loose
She don't wear no underwear
She said it only gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stopping the juice
My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality
Showed me where it's supposed to go
A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be
[Chorus]
Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend
[Verse 2]
I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out
She took a whip to me until I shout
"Oh, motherfucker, sister,  motherfucker
Can't you understand?"
[Chorus]
Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend
[Outro]
I'll do what you want me to do
Don't put me on the street and make me blue
Oh, sister, ooh sister, ooh
