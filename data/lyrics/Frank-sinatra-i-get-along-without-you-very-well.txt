[Verse 1]
I get along without you very well, of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course, I do
But I get along without you very well
[Verse 2]
I've forgotten you just like I should, of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should
[Bridge]
What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store? Should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune
[Verse 3]
I get along without you very well, of course, I do
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
For that would surely break my heart in two
