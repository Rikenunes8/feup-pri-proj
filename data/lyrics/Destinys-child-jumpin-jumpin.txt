[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's eleven thirty
 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
[Refrain: Destiny's Child]
Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Last weekend, you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies
This weekend you're goin' out
If he try to stop you, you're goin' off
You got your hair done and your nails done too
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes
You and your crew parlayin' at the hottest spot
Tonight you're gonna
Find the fellas rollin' in the Lexus, trucks and Hummers
[Refrain: Destiny's Child]
Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot
[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
All you ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'[Refrain: Destiny's Child]
Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Call your boys, 'cause tonight you're not gon' stay at home
You should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight, you going solo
Cut her off as she talk some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your haircut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit, you need to look your best
'Cause you're turnin' heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica
That's gon' dance all night if you wanna
[Refrain: Destiny's Child &
