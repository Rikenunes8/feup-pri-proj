[Chorus]
Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on me
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please
[Verse]
I used to have plenty of money, finest clothes in town
Bad luck and trouble overtook me, child, bound to get me down
[Chorus]
Please have mercy, Lord, have mercy on me
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please
[Bridge]
Keep on working now, child, oh in morning
[Verse]
Well if I've been a bad boy, baby, I declare I'll change my ways
Don't want bad luck and trouble to worry me all my days
[Chorus]
Please have mercy, Lord, have mercy on me
Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please
