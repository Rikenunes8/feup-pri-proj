[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground
[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me
[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"
[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades
But the cards were all the same[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing round the fire
[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
[Outro]
No, no, no
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me
