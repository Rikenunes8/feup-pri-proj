[Verse 1]
One of these days and it won't be long
You're going to look for me and I'll be gone
[Chorus]
Now you know I believe
(I believe, yes, I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
Well, I believe to my soul now
You're trying to make a fool of me
(I believe it, I believe it)
[Verse 2]
Well, you're going around here with your head so hard
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
[Chorus]
'Cause I believe
(I believe, yes, I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
Well, I believe to my soul now
You're trying to make a fool of me now
(I believe it, I believe it)
[Bridge]
Last night you were dreaming, and I heard you say
(Oh, Johnny!) When you know my name is Ray
[Chorus]
That's why I believe it now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
Whoa-oh, I believe to my soul now
You're trying to make a fool of me now
(I believe it)
