I love your lovin' ways when you hold my hand
And with a little squeeze you make me understand
That I'm the only one underneath the sun for you, yes, for you
I love your lovin' ways, yes, I love your lovin' ways, yes I do
I love your lovin' ways when you kiss a kiss
The way you pucker up makes me go for this
Because it makes me feel I'm the only one you need, yes, you need
Love your lovin' ways oh love your lovin' ways, yes indeed
Oh yeah, your kisses that taste so good
Oh daddy, tell me, darling, you're not made of wood
Love your lovin' ways when you hold me tight
You're always good to me and you treat me just right
So baby take my love 'cause it's made you, just you
Well I love your lovin' ways oh I love your lovin' ways yes i do...
