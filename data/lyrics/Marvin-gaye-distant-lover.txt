[Verse 1]
Distant lover, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day
[Verse 2]
Distant lover, ooh, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery (Save me, baby, save me, baby, save me, baby)
Misery (Please, save me, baby, please)
[Verse 3]
As I reminisce, ah baby (Baby)
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made (Oh, baby)
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode (Wow)
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road
[Verse 4]
Distant lover, ooh sugar (Lover, lover, lover)
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel?
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you (Every moment)
I treasured it (Every moment)
Like it was precious jewel, ah baby (Save me, baby, save me, baby, save me, baby)
Lord, have mercy (Please, save me, baby, please)
[Outro]
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say (Lover, lover, lover)
When you left you took all of me with you
My lord I wonder, do you want to hear me scream?
Plead and plead, please (Every moment)
Oh please, baby (Every moment)
Come back home, little girl (Every moment)
Oh baby (Every moment)
Please
