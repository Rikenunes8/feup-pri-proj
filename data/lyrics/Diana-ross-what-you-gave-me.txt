You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my mind
There's a picture of you and I
That nobody has the price to buy
I don't know
What made you change your mind
But you'll be back
It's just a matter of time
Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
Ooh, baby
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
Yeah
Into my life you came
Like a breath of spring
Giving me a song to sing
Though I know you're leaving
But I won't be grieving
Cause time has a way of showing us
The things that we really need
And no matter where you go
I know
You'll find your way back home
Cause though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
'Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
What you gave me
What you gave me
Is more than enough to lastYes, yes
It's more
It's more than enough to last
Yes, yes
It's more
It's more than enough to last
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
