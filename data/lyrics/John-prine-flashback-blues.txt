[Verse 1]
While window shopping through the past
I ran across a looking glass
Reflecting moments remaining in a burned-out light
Tragic magic, prayers of passion
Stay the same through changing fashion
They freeze my mind like water on a winter's night
[Chorus]
Spent most of my youth out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
So goodbye, nonbeliever
Don't you know that I hate to leave here
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Photographs show the laughs
Recorded in between the bad times
Happy sailors dancing on a sinking ship
Cloudy skies and dead fruit flies
Waving goodbye with tears in my eyes
Well, sure I made it, but you know it was a hell of a trip
[Chorus]
Spent most of my youth out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
And ten times what it grieves you
That's how much more I hate to leave you now
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Spent most of my youth out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
So goodbye, nonbeliever
Don't you know that I hate to leave here
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
