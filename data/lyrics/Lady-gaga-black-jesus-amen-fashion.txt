[Intro]
Black, black, black
Black, black, black
Black, black, black
Jesus is the new black
Jesus is the new black
Jesus is the new black
Jesus is the new black
Ow!
[Verse 1]
I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man
[Chorus]
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
[Verse 2]
Dancing in my revelation
Underground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man[Chorus]
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
[Bridge]
Put it on, amen, fashion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, a new compassion
Put it on, amen, fashion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, style your passion
Put it on, amen, fashion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, a new compassion
Put it on, amen, fashion
Celebrate, ooh-ooh, wear out your vision
Black Jesus, black Jesus, black Jesus
Jesus is the new black, ow
[Chorus]
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
Amen
On the runway, dressed in his best
Amen, fashion
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
