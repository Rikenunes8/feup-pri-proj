This house is cold and empty
Just a ghost of who I, I used to be
Staring at my own reflection
Wonder if you'd even recognize me

Who's gonna say goodnight?
Who's gonna stop the world from turning?
Who's gonna numb my pain?
Who's gonna save me when the sky is crashing down?

Ooh, aahh
I am broken
Oooohh, aahh
I am broken
Oohh, aahh
I am broken
Oohh, aahh
I am broken

This house is cold and empty
Just a ghost of who I, I used to be
Staring at my own reflection
Wonder if you'd even recognize me
Who's gonna say goodnight?
Who's gonna stop the world from turning?
Who's gonna numb my pain?
Who's gonna save me when the sky is crashing down?
