[Verse 1]
Step right up, march, push
Crawl right up on your knees
Please, greed, feed
(No time to hesitate)
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down
[Chorus]
All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?
[Verse 2]
Shove it up inside, surprise, lies
Stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck
(Away the tender parts)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
[Chorus]
All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?[Outro]
The pigs have won tonight
Now they can all sleep soundly
And everything is all right
