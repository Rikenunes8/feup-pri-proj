I'll light the fire
You place the flowers in the vase
That you bought today

Staring at the fire
For hours and hours while I listen to you
Play your love songs all night long
For me, only for me
Come to me now
And rest your head for just five minutes
Everything is done

Such a cozy room
The windows are illuminated by the evening
Sunshine through them, fiery gems
For you, only for you

Our house is a very, very, very fine house
With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy cause of you
And our

La-la, la-la-la la la...

Our house is a very, very, very fine house (fine house)

Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy cause of you
And our
I'll light the fire
While you place the flowers in the vase
That you bought today
