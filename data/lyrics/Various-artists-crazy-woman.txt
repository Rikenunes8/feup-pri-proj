Who’d-a guessed that Aqua Net
Could start a fire with a single cigarette
She wasn’t drunk, she wasn’t stoned
Just sick and tired of wonderin’ if he was coming home
She drove around, she found his car
They heard the boom from in the bar
He called the cops, she called his bluff
They hauled her off in high heels and handcuffs

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till they’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive 'em, no they weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men
He told his friends she was depressed
Borderline bipolar, a bitch with PMS
He cheats and lies, then plays the victim
He don’t know why they always seem to pick him

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till they’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive 'em, no they weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men

Some take a pistol, some take an axe
Boy, if you build a fire, you better bet she’s got a match
Might be the teacher just down the street
The hairdresser or the housewife or that waitress that’s so sweet
And you won’t see it when you meet her
So be careful how you treat her
She might look just like me

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
We keep our crazy hidden till we’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive us, no we weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men
Yeah, crazy women are made by crazy men
