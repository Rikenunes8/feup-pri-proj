[Verse]
Well I wonder what's going on, same old stuff suppose
Not quite right that the stuff's the same but it seems different to me
Seems like the cancer in this city has got to be terminal
I haven't got it, though; incidentally, where are you?
Thought you lived here, the bright lights have got you
I'd rather be a sprat than a mackerel, you can slip through the net
It's set, it also takes one to catch one
