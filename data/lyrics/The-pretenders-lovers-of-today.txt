I tried to talk to my baby
I said, "No, no, no, no, baby, please don't cry
No, no, no, baby, please
'Cause all of the leaves come down
Every time babies cry
All of the leaves come down"
I put my arms around my baby
I said, "Hush, hush, hush, hush
Baby, sleep tight now
Hush, hush, hush, baby sleep
'Cause all of the birds start to sing
Every time babies dream
All of the birds start to sing"
Oh
Nobody wants to see
Lovers of today happy
So assumed they're going to part
Nobody wants to be with someone
So afraid they'll be left with a broken heart
I kissed the eyes of my baby
I said, "Dream, dream, dream, dream
Baby, all night long
Dream, dream, dream all the night
'Cause all of the stars in the skies
Twinkle on baby's eyes
All of the stars in the skies"
Oh
Oh
I tried to talk to you, baby
No, no
Oh
Oh no
No, no, no
No, I'll never feel
Like a man in a man's world
