[Verse 1]
Every day I throw a little party
But a fit would be more fitting, fitting
And every time I climb a little higher
Should I leap or go on living, living?
Hear the voices venomous and thrilling
In my head they're always calling, calling
But I wanna gotta go the way my blood beats
So I'm not fodder for their folly, folly
[Chorus]
No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
[Verse 2]
Let's destroy a room with this love
We can drain out all the power, power
Steal from the makers who unmade us
Leave them nothing to devour, devour
[Bridge]
Well I am raw material
Make me plastic, make me fuel
I can be, I can be
I can be all
[Chorus]
No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
