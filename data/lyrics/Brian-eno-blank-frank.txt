[Verse 1]
Blank Frank, it is the messenger of your doom and your destruction
Yes, he is the one who will set you up as nothing
[Verse 2]
And he is the one who will look at you sideways
His particular skill is leaving bombs in people's driveways
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Blank Frank  has a memory that's as cold as an iceberg
The only time he speaks is in incomprehensible proverbs
[Verse 4]
Blank Frank is the siren, he's the air-raid, he's the crater
He's on the menu, on the table, he's the knife and he's the waiter
[Outro]
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
