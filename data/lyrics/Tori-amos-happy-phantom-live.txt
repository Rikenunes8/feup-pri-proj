[Verse 1]
And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go chasin' the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch
[Chorus]
Woohoo, the time is getting closer
Oohoo, time to be a ghost
Oohoo, every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I've been?
[Verse 2]
So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearin' my naughties like a jewel
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
And then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin
[Chorus]
Woohoo, the time is getting closer
Oohoo, time to be a ghost
Oohoo, every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we've been?
[Verse 3]
Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back
You found a girl that you could truly love again
WIll you still call for me when she falls asleep?
Or do we soon'd forget the things we cannot see?
[Chorus]
Woohoo, the time is getting closer
Oohoo, time to be a ghost
Oohoo, every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we've been?[Outro]
And if I die today
And if I die today
And if I die today
Ah-ah chasing nuns out in the yard
