[Verse 1]
This fucking city
Is run by pigs
They take the rights away
From all the kids
[Chorus]
Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way
[Verse 2]
Walking down the street
I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club
[Chorus]
Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way
[Verse 3]
Nothing I do
Nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked
They put me away
[Chorus]
Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way
[Bridge]
No fuckin' way
Motherfuckers gonna pay
Motherfuckers gonna pay[Verse 4]
I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail
I may serve time
[Chorus]
Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way
