[Verse 1]
Goodnight, baby
Someone's a-coming, someone's a-coming
Goodnight, baby
Gotta get a-running, gotta get a-running
Your father doesn't like me
Told you that you couldn't see me any more
That's why we meet in secret
That's why we're hiding here
[Verse 2]
Goodnight, baby
Same time tomorrow, same time tomorrow
Goodnight, baby
See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow
Your mother made you stay in
When she saw you going out with me
You'll say you'll take the dog out
Then you sneak out here to me
[Verse 3]
If your parents find you here
You're gonna get a-hiding, gonna get a-hiding
So I'll vanish, disappear
See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow
