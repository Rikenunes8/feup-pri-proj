[Verse 1]
Once in a while, in a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist invented this
4th of July night ride home
[Verse 2]
Hula girls and caterpillar
Tractors in the sand
The ukulele man, the fireworks
This 4th of July night ride home
[Chorus]
I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the overkill, far from the overload
[Verse 3]
Back at the bar, the band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines gleam
On this 4th of July night ride home
[Verse 4]
Round the curve and a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside, rev for stride
4th of July night ride home[Chorus]
I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the undertow, far from the overload
[Outro]
Once in awhile, in a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist invented this
4th of July night ride home
