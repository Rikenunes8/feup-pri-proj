If you're tired of the big so so
Get yourself into some self control
Play the game by putting on the brakes
Slow down and make less mistakes
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
The way I feel when you call my name
Makes me go crazy to sane
The way I feel when you're close to me
Finally not drifting out to sea
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
It's all in my pocket
(I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind)
I call it my rocket
(Come a little closer, hit the one, go sane)
Come on now, I wish you would
I'm the one who makes you feel good
Never mind those things they say
They don't know it, but I'm here to stay
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
