Well get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well I want my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
'cause the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do right
To save your doggone soul
I'm like the one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
I'm like the one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Well I can look at you till you ain't no child no more
Well I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do right
To save your doggone soul
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I've got so many women I don't know which way to jump
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I won't ever leave ...
Don't ever say goodbye
