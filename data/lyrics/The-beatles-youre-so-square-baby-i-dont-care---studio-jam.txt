Well, you don't know any dance steps that are new
And no one else could love you like I do, do, do, do, do

And you don't like crazy music
Don't like rocking bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands

You're so square
Baby, I don't care

Baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care
Baby
Hold it, Phyllis
