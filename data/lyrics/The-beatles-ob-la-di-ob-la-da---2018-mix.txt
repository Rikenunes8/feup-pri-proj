Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, “Girl, I like your face”
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (Chu chu chu)
Buys a twenty-carat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Yeah

In a couple of years, they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

Happy ever after in the marketplace
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening, she still sings it with the band
Yes!

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on (Heh-heh)
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
In a couple of years, they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Yeah!

Happy ever after in the marketplace
Molly lets the children lend a hand (Foot)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening, she's a singer with the band (Yeah)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on

And if you want some fun
Take Ob-la-di-bla-da
Ahh, thank you
