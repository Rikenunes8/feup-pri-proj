[Verse-1]
There's more to question than answers
And sand will slip through your hands
And love is faster than lightning
So grab it while you can mm, mm, mm...
Well I've been searching forever
Between the bad and the good
But now I know what I'm missing
And I wanna make it with you
[Hook]
One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And babe it's gotta be tonight
Babe it's gotta be tonight
[Chorus]
One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And baby it should be tonight
Baby it should be tonight
[Bridge]
One night in a lifetime
One night, one night, one night
In a lifetime, one night
[Verse-2]
They say that love is a gamble
And luck will play a trick or two
But I'll risk all of my loving
I'd put my last buck on you
[Hook]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Hook]
