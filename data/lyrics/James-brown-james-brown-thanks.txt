I've been through all them changes
A lot of stuff came down
I've dealt with all the issues
You might say I've been around
But back when I got started
There was a righteous sound
It doesn't matter what I've been through
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown
Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page
Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown
I had an attitude adjustment
I did some psycho therapy
I helped myself to some self-help
I dabbled in some ESP
Though my world is ever-changing
And I move from town to town
It doesn't matter where I've been to
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown
Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page
Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown
You got your rap and your disco
You got your drum machine
You got your R-rated gangster
You got your grungy scene
You got your state of the art
You got your digital soundIt doesn't matter where it's going to
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown
Take it to the bridge
It'll get ya where ya live
When there's water all around
You can still get outta town
And still be diggin' on James Brown
Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page
Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown
