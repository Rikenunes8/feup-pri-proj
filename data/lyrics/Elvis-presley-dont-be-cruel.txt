[Verse 1]
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
[Hook]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
[Verse 2]
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget my past
The future looks bright ahead
[Hook]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
[Bridge]
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
[Verse 3]
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
[Hook]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
[Bridge]
Why should we be apart?
I really love you, baby, cross my heart
[Verse 4]
Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say "I do"
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you[Hook]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
[Bridge]
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
[Hook]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
[Bridge]
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
