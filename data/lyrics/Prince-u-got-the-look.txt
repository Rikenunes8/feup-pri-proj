[Spoken Intro: Prince]
Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look
[Verse 1: Prince]
You walked in, I woke up
I never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
You got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me taken' aback
Crucial, I think I wantcha
[Chorus: Sheena Easton 
and Prince
]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look
[Ad lib: Prince]
Look here
[Verse 2: Prince]
You got the look
You got the look
You must'a took
You must'a took
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected
Everybody's inspected
But you are a natural beauty unaffected
Unaffected
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected
I stand corrected
[Chorus: Sheena Easton 
and Prince
]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look[Spoken Interlude: Prince with 
Sheena Easton

There's no girl to do
Well here we are
Ladies and gentlemen
The dream we all dream of
Oh, please!
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
Slammin'!
