When you met me, oh oh, everything was rosy, oh no no
When you let me, oh oh, everything must surely work out fine
If you go, oh oh, everything's that's rosy turns to pieces
You know, oh oh, everything will go under, believe me
Where will I run to? Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side
Where will I run to? What would I do?
I really will, I really can, I really do, I really have a love for you
If you get me, oh oh, that could save us all some conversation
Don't upset me, oh oh, everything is cozy here tonight
If I move, oh oh, you'd be standing by, it would make a difference
Is it true, oh oh, are you coming through, or were you just leaving?
Where will I run to? Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side
