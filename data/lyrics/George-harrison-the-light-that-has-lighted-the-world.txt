[Verse 1]
I've heard how some people, have said that I've changed
That I'm not what I was, how it really is a shame
The thoughts in their heads manifest on their brow
Like bad scars from ill feelings they themselves arouse
So hateful of anyone that is happy or free
They live all their lives without looking to see
The light that has lighted the world
[Verse 2]
It's funny how people just won't accept change
As if nature itself they'd prefer re-arranged
So hard to move on when you're down in a hole
Where there's so little chance to experience soul
I'm grateful to anyone that is happy or free
For giving me hope while I'm looking to see
The light that has lighted the world
