In Athabasca we set a fire
To the world we left far behind
All the faces we put away
Lost lives float into space
I got a message, I got a sign
Through the wires swinging in time
It's so simple, it's like the sun
Shines down on everyone
Black bird from the blue
I give my love to get used
High hopes come true
You give your love to get used
In Athabasca we lit a fire
To the path that led to our lives
Quit the faces we couldn't place
Ex-minds fill up our space
I got a signal, I got a sign
From the trees swinging in time
It's so simple, it's like the sun
Shines down on everyone
Let's hang on to abandon
Let's hope we lose control
To be out in the open baby
And let go of the ropes
Nothing into nothing
You give your love to get used
I give my love to get used
You give your love to get used
