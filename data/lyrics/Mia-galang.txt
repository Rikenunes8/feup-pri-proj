Who the hell is huntin' you
In the BMW?
How the hell he find you?

Feds gon' get you
Pull the strings on the hood
One paranoid youth
Blazin' through the hood
Who the hell is huntin' you
In the BMW?
How the hell he find you?

Feds gon' get you
Pull the strings on the hood
One paranoid youth
Blazin' through the hood

[Verse 2]
They say
Rivers gonna run though
Work is gonna save you
Pray and you will pull through
Suck a dick'll help you
Don't let 'em get to you
If he's got one, you get two
Backstab your crew
Sell it, I could sell you
They say
Rivers gonna run though
Work is gonna save you
Pray and you will pull through
Suck a dick'll help you
Don't let 'em get to you
If he's got one, you get two
Backstab your crew
Sell it I could sell you[Chorus]

Blaze a blaze, galang-a-lang-a-lang-lang
Purple haze, galang-a-lang-a-ang-lang
