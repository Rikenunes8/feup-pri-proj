[Intro]
Takinâ€™ off
[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
But I tell you, just be satisfied and stay right where you are
[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive
[Verse 2]
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive (Shake)
[Interlude]
(Ow!)
[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Whoa), keep yourself alive
Oh, take you all your time and-a money to keep me satisfied
[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money, keep yourself alive
[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money to keep me satisfied[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
[Outro]
Take you all your time and money, honey, you will survive
Keep you satisfied, keep yourself alive
