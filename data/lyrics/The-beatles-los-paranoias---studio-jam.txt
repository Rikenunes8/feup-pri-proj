Come on now, gents
Swing a la latina
Los paranoias
Invite you to (I can't take it)
To just enjoy us (I can’t take it)
Come on you can do it (I can't take it)
Baby come on and join los paranoias
Just enjoy us
Los paranoias
Oh los paranoias
Come on enjoy us
Harmony
Los paranoias
Come on enjoy us
Los paranoias
Los paranoias
Come on enjoy us
We're los paranoias
We’re here to sing for you
And what if you want us to we will
Sing a little song for you
Los paranoias
Come on enjoy us
(Mangos, Papayas.......from the highest
It's my place to say that I, cha cha boom)
Besame...
Los paranoias
Come on and just enjoy us
You know, you sit back by the fire
By the fire, baby
Come and get higher with los paranoias
Just enjoy us
Sit back and enjoy paranoia
Paranoias
Can you take some drum?
Ah, los paranoias
We want you to enjoy us
Los paranoias
We want you enjoy us
