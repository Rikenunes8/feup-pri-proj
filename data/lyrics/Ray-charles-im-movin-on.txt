[Verse 1]
That big eight-wheeler running down the track
Means your true loving daddy ain't acoming back
[Chorus 1]
Because he's moving on, he's rolling on
You were flying too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving on
[Verse 2]
But some day, baby, when you've had you play
You're going to want your daddy but your daddy will say
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
Mr. Farmer, won't you please listen to me?
Cause I got to pretty mamma in Tennessee
[Chorus 1]
Keep rolling on, keep moving on
Please listen to me, let this rattler free
And keep moving on, move on old son, move on
[Verse 4]
Well, I told you, baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
[Chorus 1]
And now I'm moving on, I'm rolling on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
But I'm moving on, move on, baby, move on
[Outro]
I said move on, I said move on [x2]
Well, I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
I said move on, I said move on [x2]
