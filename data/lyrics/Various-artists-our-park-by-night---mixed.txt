On this night I feel a certain liberation
I took the bus to find out what you meant to me
Saw the park and got off at my destination
12 o'clock and suddenly I feel so free
Don’t know what it could be
On some days
I feel it crashing in
If I could see you out where the sign meets
I’d hold you once again
Every night I listen closely
For your wind to catch me
In a park way after dark
On this bench I felt an inch of desperation
Missed my bus and felt no major urge to leave
Saw a park and followed my dumb inclination
12 o'clock and suddenly I feel so free
Don’t know what it could be
On some days
I feel it crashing in
If I could see you out where the sign meets
I’d hold you once again
Every night I listen closely
For your wind to catch me
In a park way after dark
