[Verse 1]
I see a dog star jiving like he's magic snatching
It keeps me up awake, a crystal cracking
I can't wait, I can't stay a candle
Gotta change my mind before it burns out
[Chorus 1]
I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop
[Verse 2]
I see a falling snowgirl walking Broadway
Turns the corner at 14th and I know there's no way
It's alright, it's a lighted candle
And I know she'll be okay by someday
[Chorus 2]
I'm the cocker on the rock
Humming bells start chiming in your electric clock
[Bridge]
It's safe to say, candle
Tonight's the day, candle
It's alright now, candle
The wind's away, candle
Never thought I'd see a dog star falling[Chorus 1]
I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop
