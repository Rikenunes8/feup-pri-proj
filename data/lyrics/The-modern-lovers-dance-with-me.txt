Well hi dear I'm just here from outside
I've been out all alone in the cold night
And in the shopping centre at midnight
I've been out all alone in the moonlight
So I'm cold, but I can dance
And I say, dance with me
Well hi now, I'm just back from Europe
I learned a lot, I used to dance in the big dances in the cities
Well you're all alone in the dorm here
I'm excited and you're safe and warm
You're warm, I'm cold
And I say, dance with me
Alright
And if you dance with me
Right, look at me and smile
If you look at me
Well then I hope you'll smile
Because your face is pure sex when you smile
It's written in huge suburban letters
Which say 'tenderness,' which say 'sex'
I say dance with me
But I came over here
I just shaved my face with a shaver
And I just did it to try and make myself handsome
Your life must be dull in the dorm here
I'm excited and you're safe and warm
So you're warm, I'm cold
I say, dance with me
(alright, now for the middle part now)
Well now, dear don't you love the city?
Don't you love the idea of city romance?
You're my modern, suburban pretty
I say dance with me
Alright
Am
Well hi now, how's it goin? I'm just here from outside
I've been out all alone in the cold night
And in the shopping centre at midnight
I've been out all alone in the cold of the moonlight
So here I am cold, but I can dance
And I say, dance with me
