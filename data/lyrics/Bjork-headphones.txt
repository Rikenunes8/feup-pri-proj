[Verse 1]
Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
So warm
Sounds go through the muscles
These abstract, wordless movements
Move, move, move, move, move
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
These cells are virgins
Waking up slowly (Waking up)
Waking up slowly (Wake up)
[Chorus]
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
[Post-Chorus 1]
Nothing will be the same
I'm asleep
I'm fast asleep
[Verse 2]
I like this resonance
It elevates me
I don't recognise myself
This is very interesting
[Chorus]
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
Lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
[Post-Chorus 2]
I'm fast asleep now
You're still with me
I'm fast asleep
I'm asleep[Chorus]
My headphones
They saved, saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
