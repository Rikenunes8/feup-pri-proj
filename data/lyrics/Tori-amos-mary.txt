[Verse 1]
Everybody wants something from you
Everybody wants a piece of Mary
Lush valley all dressed in green
Just ripe for the picking
God, I want to get you out of here
You can ride in a pink Mustang
When I think of what we've done to you
Oh, Mary, can you hear me?
Growing up isn't always fun
They tore your dress and stole your ribbons
They see you cry, they lick their lips
But butterflies don't belong in nets
[Chorus]
Mary, can you hear me?
Mary, you're bleeding
Mary, don't be afraid
We're just waking up and I hear help is on the way
Mary, can you hear me?
Mary, like Jimi said
Mary, don't be afraid
'Cause even the wind, even the wind cries your name
[Verse 2]
Everybody wants you, sweetheart
Everybody got a dream of glory
Las Vegas got a pinup girl
They got her armed as they buy and sell her
Rivers of milk are running dry
Can't you hear the dolphins crying?
What'll we do when our babies scream
Fill their mouths with some acid rain?
[Chorus]
Mary, can you hear me?
Mary, you're bleeding
Mary, don't be afraid
We're just waking up and I hear help is on the way
Mary, can you hear me?
Mary, like Jimi said
Mary, don't be afraid
'Cause even the wind, even the wind cries your name[Bridge]
Na-na-na-na na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na na-na-na-na-na ooh-ooh
Na-na-na-na na na-na-na-na-na
Oh, butterflies don't belong in nets
[Chorus]
Mary, can you hear me?
Mary, you're bleeding
Mary, don't be afraid
We're just waking up and I hear help is on the way
Mary, can you hear me?
Mary, like Jimi said
Mary, don't be afraid
'Cause even the wind, even the wind cries your name
[Outro]
'Cause even the wind cries your name
'Cause even the wind cries your name
Cries your name
Cries your name
Cries your name
