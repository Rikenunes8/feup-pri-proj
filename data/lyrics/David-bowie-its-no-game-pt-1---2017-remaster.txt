"1, 2, 1-2-3"

Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no jiyuu no kaidan wa nai

Silhouettes and shadows
Watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven!
It's no game

Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai
Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation!

And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers
Nammin no kiroku eiga
Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi
Michi ni ishi o nage reba kona gona ni kudake
Kino ni huta o sureba kyohu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru

So where's the moral
When people have their fingers broken?
To be insulted by these fascists
It's so degrading

And it's no game

Shut up!
Shut u...
