[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could
[Pre-Chorus]
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
[Pre-Chorus]
If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied
Satisfied
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus]
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Outro]
Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
(Maybe I didn't love you...)
