[Verse 1]
Words and guitar, I got it
Words and guitar, I want it
Way way too loud, I got it
Words and guitar
[Chorus]
I want it all
(Can't take this away from me)
I want it all
(Music is the air I breathe)
I want it
(Can't take this away from me)
Words and guitar
[Verse 2]
Take, take the noise in my head
Take, take the noise in my head
C'mon and turn, turn it up
I wanna turn, turn you on
[Chorus]
I want it all
(Fill the space surrounding me)
I want it all
(That is if you never breathe)
I want it
(Fill the space surrounding me)
Words and guitar[Bridge]
I dream of quiet songs
I hear the silky sounds
Hush, hush and rock
Oh, give me pretty songs
Oh, let me have that sound tonight
[Verse 1]
Words and guitar, I got it
Words and guitar, I want it
Way way too loud, I want it
Words and guitar
[Chorus]
I got it all
(tell me what you want in me)
I got it all
(Tell me what you want in me)
I got it
(Tell me what you want in me)
Words and guitar
[Verse 2]
Take, take the noise in my head
(Well, you want it or you don't)
Take, take the noise in my head
(Either you'll come or you won't)
C'mon and turn, turn it up
(It's the thing you'll never know)
I wanna turn, turn you on
(It's the thing you'll never own)[Chorus]
I want it all
(rock you till you're good and dead)
I want it all
(Rock you till there's nothing left)
I want it
(Rock until you're good and dead)
Words and guitar
[Bridge]
I dream of quiet sounds
I hear the pretty songs
Hush, hush and rock
Oh, give me pretty songs
Oh, let me have that sound tonight
[Verse 1]
Words and guitar, I want it
Words and guitar, I got it
Way way too loud, I want it
Words and guitar
[Chorus]
I got it all
(Tell me what you wanna be)
I got it all
(All the things you'll never be)
I got it
(Tell me what you want in me)
Words and guitar
