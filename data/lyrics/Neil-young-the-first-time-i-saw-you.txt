Okay, we're gonna start with a, um, start on an F. Just riding on the F. Maybe that's a good way to start. Or maybe the D. What do you think, Ben?
Uh, the F sounds good...

The last time I saw Elvis
He was shootin' at a color TV
The phones were ringing in the pink motel
And the rest is history
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singin' a gospel song
You could tell he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king (He was the king)

The last time I saw Elvis
He was up on the silver screen
Pushin' a plow in a black and white movie
And everybody started to scream
'Cause he was the king

The last time I saw Elvis
It was some kind of Vegas dream
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape
And a blue-haired lady screamed
He was the king

The last time I saw Elvis
He was frontin' a three-piece band
Rockin' on the back of a flatbed truck
With an old guitar in his hand
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis

The last time I saw Elvis
He was ridin' in a pink Cadillac
Wind was blowin' through his hair
And he never did look back
He was the king

Thank you very much

The last time I saw Elvis
He was singin' that gospel song
You could tell that he had the feelin'
And the whole world sang along
He was the king (He was the king)
He was the king
He was the king

Elvis has left the arena. But he was rockin' while he was gettin' out of there. Ah man, you put me right out of my seat when you said "Thank you very much." I almost stopped playing. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
