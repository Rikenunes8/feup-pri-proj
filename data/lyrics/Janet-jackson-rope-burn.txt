[Intro]
(Mmm, my lips hurt)
[Chorus]
Tie me up, tie me down (Tie me)
Make me moan real loud (Make me moan real loud)
Take off my clothes (Take off my clothes)
No one has to know
Whisperin', I wanna feel a soft rope burn
Wanna feel a (Rope burn)
[Verse 1]
When you walked into the room, you knew just what to do
You could have gone from door to door
But you knew just where to go to
Come into my velvet rope and tell me fantasies
(Tell me your fantasies)
The passion in your voice I wanna hear as you start to tell me
While you're at it, take the blindfold, tie it gently on me
Don't wanna see but feel the things you're gonna do to me
[Chorus]
Tie me up, tie me down (Tie me)
Make me moan real loud (Make me moan real loud)
Take off my clothes (Take off my clothes)
No one has to know
Whisperin', I wanna feel a soft rope burn
Wanna feel a (Rope burn)
[Verse 2]
One in the morning, I'm feelin' so free and sensual
Lyin' here, wearin' just my imagination for you
The sensation will do
Can you feel the warmth of the candlelight embrace your body?
I'm feelin' the hot candle wax drippin' down the small of my back
(You wanna know what my tongue feels like?)
(Mmm, you like that?)[Chorus]
Tie me up, tie me down (Tie me)
Make me moan real loud (Make me moan real loud)
Take off my clothes (Take off my clothes)
No one has to know
Whisperin', I wanna feel a soft rope burn
Wanna feel a (Rope burn)
Tie me up, tie me down (Tie me)
Make me moan real loud (Make me moan real loud)
Take off my clothes (Take off my clothes)
No one has to know
Whisperin', I wanna feel a soft rope burn
Wanna feel aâ€”
