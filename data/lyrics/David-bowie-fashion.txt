[Verse 1]
There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Ooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
[Verse 2]
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear
That people from good homes are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
Oh bop, fashion
[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep[Outro]
