I gave up looking for a reason
To live with things just the way they were
I came around, used to be easy to get to
So they, got to me in just about every way
Caught with no cards up your sleeve not much to choose from
Grew up all along just thinking that you couldn't lose
Don't want to live without that security
You'd think that, with a little bit more, you'd be alright
Can't stop the world. Can't stop the world. Can't stop the world
Why let it stop you. Why let it stop you. Why let it stop you
Can't stop the world. Can't stop the world
Your heart, your will, your car, they've all been broken
You let everybody know about your better days
You got beat and it's not entertaining
Watching you try to stand up on your feet again
Can't stop the world. Can't stop the world. Can't stop the world
Why let it stop you. Why let it stop you. Why let it stop you
Can't stop the world
Go! [guitar solo]
