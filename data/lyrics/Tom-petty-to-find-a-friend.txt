[Verse 1]
In the middle of his life
He left his wife
And ran off to be bad
Boy, it was sad
[Verse 2]
But he bought a new car
He found a new bar
And went under another name
Created a whole new game
[Chorus]
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
[Verse 3]
Meanwhile then
His wife's boyfriend
Moved in and took over the house
Everybody was quiet as a mouse
[Verse 4]
And it changed their lives
Changed their plans
Slowly they grew apart
Boy, it woulda broke your heart
[Chorus]
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
[Chorus]
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend[Chorus]
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
