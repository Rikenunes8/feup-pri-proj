I got worries by the ton
Gettin' cancer's only one
Overtaxed and alimonied
Tired of eatin' fried baloney
I got burdens on my shoulders
Dying young or growin' older
There's some brain cells I'm missin'
But despite it all, I'd like to say
I'm gonna have a good day today
Gonna have a good time anyway
Put it all behind me, lay it all away
Gonna be a good day today
Bills and pills and former wives
Past mistakes and former lives
Bank account is overdrawn
Out of Prozac, hairline's gone
Hearing voices in my head
Say I should've stayed in bed
Dog just died, but what the heck
Nothing worse can happen anyway
So
I'm gonna have a good day today
Me
I'm gonna have a good time anyway
Put it all behind me, lay it all away
Gonna be a good day today
Pulled my back and wrecked my car
Girlfriend stole my VCR
Letter came from Sixty Minutes
Say they wanna put me in it
Tell me my career just died
Years ago I might've cried
Now I'm just too old to do it
May be true, but screw it anyway
Me
I'm gonna have a good day today
And
I'm gonna have a good time anyway
Put it all behind me, lay it all away
Gonna be a good day today
Hey
I'm gonna have a good day today
Me
I'm gonna have a good time anyway
Put it all behind me, lay it all away
Gonna be a good day today
