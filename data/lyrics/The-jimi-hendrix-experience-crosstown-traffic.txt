[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a drive
[Chorus]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can ha, I can see you had your fun
But uh, darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead
[Chorus]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
And I got better things on the other side of town
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
(Crosstown traffic)
Look out, (look out)
Look out baby, comin through
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah yeah, (look out)
(Crosstown traffic)
(Yeah) yeah, (look out)
Look out, look out baby
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, (look out)
What's that on the street?
Move over
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, (look out)
Yeah! (Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, (look out)
