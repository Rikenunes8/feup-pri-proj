If you want me, it's changing
If you want, everything's changing
If you want, the sky would open up
If you want, your eyes could open up
I'm a mess
I'm the worst
But the best
That you've heard
Come so far, come close together
Don't tear apart what we worked for
Right or wrong, here we are
I wanna know what you are
What you are
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
'Cause I'll head out the fences, head out the door
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
'Cause I'll roll with the punches, roll out the door
I don't know
What you want
But I got
What you...
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
'Cause I'll head out the fences, head out the door
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
'Cause I'll roll with the punches, roll out the door
