[Verse 1]
Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?
[Verse 2]
Look around, you'll find the ground
Is not so far from where you are, but don't be too wise
For down below they never grow
They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes
Never a surprise
[Chorus]
Take your time and you'll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see what's meant to be
Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before
[Verse 3]
Don't be shy, you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done,
 if only you see
Just what you are beneath a star
That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free
Yes, be what you'll be
[Instrumental]
[Verse 4]
Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?
[Chorus 2]
Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes, that's day
And open wide the hymns you hide
You find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what you'll say[Outro]
About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people around your head
Who say everything's been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rain
