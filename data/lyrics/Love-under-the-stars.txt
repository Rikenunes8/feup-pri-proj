One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
And I'm so shy (So shy)
A bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Oh-oh (Young love, young love, young love)

Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you (Baby, baby, baby)
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye (Oh yeah)
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was drifting

To another state of mind (Drifting, drifting, drifting)
And imagined I was yours and you were mine (My own, baby)
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Lay underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
I was drifting, drifting
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
(Young love, young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars, baby, baby
