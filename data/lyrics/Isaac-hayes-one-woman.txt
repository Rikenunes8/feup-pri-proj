I fight my way through the 5 o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door
To that little room that we, we call home
Her loving arms are there to greet me
And her tender lips are always there to meet me
At the end of every day
You know, it's always been that way
Then I fight my way through the early morning traffic
Oh, but someone else is heavy on my mind
Then I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop
And she's right on time
Her loving arms are there to greet me
And her tender lips are there to meet me
That's the way I start my day
But it's too bad it doesn't end that way
One woman's is making my home
While the other woman's making me do wrong
I didn't intend to let it get that strong
Now I've got to decide where I belong
[Break]
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
That's the way I start my day
Oh it's too bad, so sad, it doesn't end that way
One woman's making my home, yes she is
While the other woman's, you know making me do wrong
I didn't intend to let this pain get that strong
Now I gotta decide where I, where I, where I belong
One woman's making my home, yes she is now
The other woman's making this man do wrong
I don't know which one, which one to choose, no I don't
And neither one can this man bear to lose, oh no, no, noI said, one woman's making my home
While this other woman making me do wrong, oh yeah
I didn't intend to let this pain get this strong
Now I gotta decide where I belong, tell me which way to go
One woman's making my home
The other woman's got me doing wrong
