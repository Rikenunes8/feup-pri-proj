[Verse 1]
I'm lost, exposed
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
I can't make myself heard
[Chorus 1]
No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation
[Verse 2]
Full fed, yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted, I tell myself, yet I still wander
Down inside
[Chorus 2]
It's tearing me apart, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation
[Bridge]
(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)
[Verse 3]
At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
I can't make myself heard
[Chorus 1]
No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation
[Outro]
(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)
