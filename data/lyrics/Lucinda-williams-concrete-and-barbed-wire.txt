[Verse 1]
This wall divides us
We're on two different sides
But this wall is not real
How can it be real
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
[Chorus]
Concrete and barbed wire
Concrete and barbed wire
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
[Verse 2]
Back in Algiers my darling broke my heart
But he can't seem to break down this wall
With two strong hands he couldn't move it at all
And it's only made of concrete and barbed wire
[Chorus]
Concrete and barbed wire
Concrete and barbed wire
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
[Verse 3]
Down in Opelousas dogs are at the gate
And they're mean lord they're mean
There's a wall between us, but it's not what it seems
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
[Chorus]
Concrete and barbed wire
Concrete and barbed wire
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
[Verse 4]
Somewhere in Louisiana my sugar's doing time
But he can't spend time with me
If he could get over this wall he'd see
That it's only made of concrete and barbed wire[Chorus]
Concrete and barbed wire
Concrete and barbed wire
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
Concrete and barbed wire
Concrete and barbed wire
It's only made of concrete and barbed wire
