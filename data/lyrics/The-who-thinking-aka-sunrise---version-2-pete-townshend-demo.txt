You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
But now and then, I see a friend who I look at and smile
But then I realize it's only because I'm thinking of you all the while

No other girl looks good unless I compare her to you
Some, sometimes I feel this will go on my life through
And then again, I'll turn down love 'cause I'm thinking of you
And then I smile, it's only because I'm thinking of you all the while
The times I'll let myself down by walking around
Thinking of only you
The chances I've lost, opportunities tossed
Away and into the blue

You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
But now and then, I see a friend who I look at and smile
But then I realize it's only because I'm thinking of you all the while

All the while
Thinking of you all the while
Thinking of you all the while
I'm thinking of you all the while
