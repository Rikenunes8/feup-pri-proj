[Verse 1]
I was under the Calvary Cross
The pale-faced lady, she said to me
I've watched you with my one green eye
I'll hurt you till you need me
[Verse 2]
You scuff your heels and you spit on your shoes
You do nothing with a reason
One day you catch a train
Never leaves the station
[Chorus]
Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me
[Verse 3]
Now you can make believe on your tin whistle
Ah, and you can be my broom boy
Scrub me till I shine in the dark
I'll be your light till doomsday
[Verse 4]
There's a black cat cross your path
Why don't you follow?
My claw's in you and my light's in you
And this is your first day of sorrow
[Chorus]
Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me (For me)
