[Verse 1]
If your girl only knew
That you was tryin' to get with me (What would she do?)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me, she
[Chorus]
She would probably leave (Probably leave)
You alone (You alone)
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
 (Oh)
I bet she'd be glad (Oh, yeah)
That you was gone (That you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry, no
[Verse 2]
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you (If she knew)
And if your girl could only see
How you be callin' me
Gettin' fresh with me
She'd probably leave
[Chorus]
She would probably leave (Leave you)
You alone (You alone)
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
 (Unplug her phone)
I bet she'd be glad (She'd be glad)
That you was gone (That you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry[Verse 3]
She
She's crazy, put up with you (Hey)
But boy, I won't be no fool (Won't be no fool)
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me (No, baby)
Girl, it's dumb to put up with you (With you)
I won't be no fool (Won't be no fool)
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone (Alone)
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (She'd be glad)
That you was gone (That you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry
She would probably leave (Leave)
You alone (You alone)
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
 (Oh)
I bet she'd be glad (Oh, yeah)
That you was gone (That you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry[Chorus]
She would probably leave (If your girl only knew)
You alone
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (If your girl only knew)
That you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
