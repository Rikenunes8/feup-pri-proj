[Verse 1]
Whomever wants you alone
Whomever wants you atoned
It's with this prayer, I disown
Whomever wants you alone
[Chorus]
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
Of ash and mud and time slipped away
Of ash and mud and time slipped away
[Verse 2]
I gave you all and all was had (And always)
I gave you all as all was asked (As always)
As pieces of eight fall from grasp
Whomever asks for more than that?
They can't behold you
[Chorus]
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
Of ash and mud and time slipped away
Of ash and mud and time slipped away
[Chorus]
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
(Color of your love)
And the color of your love is gray
Of ash and mud and time slipped away
