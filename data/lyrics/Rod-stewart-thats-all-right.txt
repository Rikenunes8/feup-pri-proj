[Verse 1]
That's all right my mama, that's all right for you
That's all right my mama any old way you do
[Chorus]
But that's all right, well that's all right
Well that's all right, my mama
Any way that you wanna do, woo
[Verse 2]
My mother, she did tell me
Papa did tell me too
Son, that woman that you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you
[Chorus]
But that's all right, well that's all right
Yeah, that's all right, my mama
Any old way that you wanna do
Get in there
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
I'll be leaving here tomorrow
Leaving here for sure
You ain't gotta be bothered with me
Hangin' 'round your door
[Chorus]
But that's all right, yeah, that's all right
Well that's all right, my mama
Any old way that you wanna do, woo
That's all right, my mama
That's all right for you
That's all right, my mama
Any old way you do
That's all right
Well that's all right
Well that's all right, my mama
Any way that you wanna do, woo
That's all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do, woohoo
Well all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do, oh yeah
Well all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do, woohoo
That's all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do
That's all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do
That's all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do, woohoo
That's all right, my mama
Any way you wanna do
