[Verse 1]
What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair?
The love that you cherish so often may perish
And leave you with castles in air
[Verse 2]
When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone
[Verse 3]
What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone
