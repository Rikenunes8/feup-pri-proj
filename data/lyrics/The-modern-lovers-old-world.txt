Well the old world may be dead
Our parents can't understand
But I still love my parents
And I still love the old world
Oh, I had a New York girlfriend
And she couldn't understand how I could
Still love my parents and still love the old world
So I told her:
I want to keep my place in the old world
Keep my place in the arcane
Cause I still love my parents and I still love the old world
Alright
I say old world
I say old world
I say
Well I see a '50's apartment house
Bleak in the morning sun
But I still love the '50's
And I still love the old world
I wanna keep my place in the old world
Keep my place in the arcane
Cause I still love my parents and I still love the old world
Alright
I see the '50's apartment house
It's bleak in the 1970's sun
But I still love the '50's
And I still love the old world
I wanna keep my place in this old world
Keep my place in the arcane knowledge
And I still love the '50's and I still love the old world
Alright now we say bye bye old world
Gotta help the new world
Oh bye bye
I say bye bye bye bye old world
