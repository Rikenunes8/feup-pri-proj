It's true, yes it's true
I'm as guilty of this sin as you
I lived through it too
As you can see
It didn't hurt me
You must admit you helped a bit

(It takes two to tango) No I wasn't alone
(It takes two to tango) I remember it still
(It takes two to tango) Drink a toast if you will
This is for the girls who just couldn't see
That my only sin was being me
And this one’s for the girls and they know who they are
It’s so long ago and I don’t know

Now I don’t recall
All the details of the scene at all
But I had a ball
And learned all the games
Forgot all the names
You must admit you learned a bit

(It takes two to tango) No I wasn't alone
(It takes two to tango) I remember it still
(It takes two to tango) Drink a toast if you will

This is for the girls who couldn’t understand
What it’s like to try to be a man
And this one’s for the girls and they know who they are
It’s so long ago and I don’t know

I don’t know, I don't even know at all
Who was right and who was wrong
I just don’t remember all
All the things that were said
What went on in my head
But it’s easy to see that I used you and you used me
This is for the girls who think I’ve done wrong
Could you really hold a grudge that long?
And this one’s for the girls and they know who they are
It’s so long ago and I don’t know who you are
