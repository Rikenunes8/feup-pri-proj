Born in Louisiana in a town called Franklin
I was fully matured by the time I reached the age of 10
Mulatto girl, that's what they called me
And us mulattos have no trouble at all with men
All men say that I'm as sweet as honey
'Cause I'm 34, 38 and 22 at the tummy
They call me Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet, cheap, that's what they said
About Sweet Rhode Island red
Tried to live the life I thought they wanted me to
I went to church, then to school, was a member of a BYEDU
And Pastor Taylor, and Deacon Jones
They were just too hot headed to leave me alone
They said, that I was sweet as honey
'Cause I'm 34, 38 and 22 at the tummy
They call me Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet, cheap, that's what they said
About Sweet Rhode Island red
I was 17 when I moved to New Orleans
'Cause living in the city has always been my dream
People there said it was a shame and a pity
When old Mayor Daley gave me the key to the city
He too said that I was as sweet as honey
'Cause I'm 34, 38 and 22 at the tummy
They call me Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red
Sweet Rhode Island red

Sweet, cheap, that's what they said
About Sweet Rhode Island Red
