[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again
[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams
[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind[Outro]
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
