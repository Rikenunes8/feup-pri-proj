[Intro]
We don't care if you only love "we"
We don't care if you only love "we"
[Verse 1]
We love you
We love you
And we hope that you will love "we" too
[Verse 2]
We love "they"
We love "they"
And we want you to love "they" too
[Bridge]
We don't care if you hound "we"
And love is all around "we"
Love can't get our minds off
We love you, we love you
You will never win "we"
Your uniforms don't fit "we"
We forget the place we're in
'Cause we love you
We love you, of course we do
[Verse 3]
I love you
I love you
And I hope that you are grooving, too
[Outro]
We love you (We do)
We love you (We do)
