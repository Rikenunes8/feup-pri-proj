Stop here
This is for you
As my love that was for nobody
As the rain that didn't wet you
And the sun that didn't warm you
Stop here
This is for you
You don't need to pay
Because it didn't cost me anything
Stop here and go away
Take your time with you
I haven't the time for you
My feelings were fueled by yours
The walls that surrounded my city
Stop here
This is for you
As my love that was for nobody
You're a million and I've loved you
You're a million and I'm yours
You're a million, I'm not yours
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
