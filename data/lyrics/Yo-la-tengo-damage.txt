[Verse 1]
Nothing much Friday night
Pinball, the Lower East Side
Walked out of the past and into the bar
[Verse 2]
I used to think about you all the time
I would think about you all the time
Now it just feels weird that there you are
[Hook]
The damage is done
[Verse 3]
I feel like a kid again
My eyes are glued to the floor
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door
[Hook]
The damage is done
The damage is done
