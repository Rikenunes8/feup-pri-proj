[Verse 1]
A day once dawned
And it was beautiful
A day once dawned from the ground
Then the night she fell
And the air was beautiful
The night she fell all around
[Chorus]
So look see the days
The endless colored ways
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning
[Verse 2]
And now we rise
And we are everywhere
And now we rise from the ground
See she flies
And she is everywhere
See she flies all around
[Chorus]
So look, see the sights
The endless summer nights
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning
