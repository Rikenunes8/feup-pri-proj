[Verse 1]
I spent a lot of my time looking at blue
The color of my room and my mood
Blue on the walls, blue out of my mouth
The sort of blue between clouds, when the sun comes out
The sort of blue in those eyes you get hung up about
[Verse 2]
When that feeling of meaninglessness sets in
Go blowing my mind on God
The light in the dark, with the neon arms
The meek He seeks, the beast He calms
The head of the good soul department
[Chorus]
I see myself suddenly
On the piano, as a melody
My terrible fear of dying
No longer plays with me
For now I know that I'm needed
For the symphony
[Verse 3]
I associate love with red
The colour of my heart when she's dead
Red in my mind when the jealousy flies
Red in my eyes from emotional ties
Manipulation, the danger signs
[Verse 4]
The more I think about sex, the better it gets
Here we have a purpose in life
Good for the blood circulation
Good for releasing the tension
The root of our reincarnations
[Chorus]
I see myself suddenly
On the piano, as a melody
My terrible fear of dying
No longer plays with me
For now I know that I'm needed
For the symphony[Outro]
I spent a lot of my time looking at blue
No wonder that I blew it
