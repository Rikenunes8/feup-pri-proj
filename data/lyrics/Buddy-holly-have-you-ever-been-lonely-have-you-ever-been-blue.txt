[Verse 1]
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever loved someone
Just as I love you?
[Verse 2]
Can't you see I'm sorry
For each mistake I've made?
Can't you see I've changed dear?
Can't you see I've paid?
[Verse 3]
Be a little forgiving
Take me back to your heart
How can I go on living
While we're apart?
[Verse 4]
If you knew what I've been through
Then you'd know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
[Outro]
