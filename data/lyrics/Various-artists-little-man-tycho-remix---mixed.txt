You grew high, taller than the middle class
Boy, cash running in your pockets
You skate high, gold on your finger tips
They try to make people nervous
Something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell my when, tell me why? when?
Green dollar bills slipped your hand, little man
Anything you wanna come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Anything you wanna come instantly
Castle, house, cars and the ladies
Blues, no doubt, got you feeling empty
Your bank's packed to edge and still you're sad
Something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell my when, tell me why? when?
Green dollar bills slipped your hand, little man
Anything you wanna come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Anything you wanna come instantly
