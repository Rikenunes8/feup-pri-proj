[Verse 1]
She shadows me in the mirror
She never leaves on the light
And some things that I say to her
They just don't seem to bite
[Chorus]
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
[Verse 2]
She tricks me into thinkin'
I can't believe my eyes
I wait for her forever
But she never does arrive
[Chorus]
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
[Bridge]
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything wil be alright
(Be alright)
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright[Verse 3]
She's always out makin' pictures
She's always out makin' scenes
She's always out the window
When it comes to makin' dreams
[Chorus]
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
[Bridge]
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
[Outro]
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
She says to leave it to me, yeah
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
If you leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything will be alright
(Be alright)
Yeah, if you leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
(Be alright)
(Be alright)
(Be alright)
(Be alright)
