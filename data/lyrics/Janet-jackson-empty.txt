[Intro]
(
One, two, one, two, three, four
)
[Verse 1]
How could it be that you knew me?
My deepest fears, my fantasies?
Confide in you what no one knows
But it feels so real
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty
[Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Woah, I feel empty
(When I close my eyes)
[Verse 2]
Is this a new way to love?
Never face-to-face, is it enough?
Does it really count or am I a fool?
So tell me, please, am I wasting my time?
Your phrases, descriptive
And through the textured words
With beauty, you post it
And use such colored verbs
We've never met, ooh (
One, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty
[Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Woah, I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Empty
(When I close my eyes)[Verse 3]
Rushin' home to turn you on
Sometimes you're there, sometimes you're gone
 (
One, two, three, four
)
Wait for hours for your return
So tell me, please, am I wasting my time?
Your phrases, descriptive
And through the textured words
With beauty, you post it
And use such colored verbs (
One, two, three, four
)
So tell me, you think that maybe we've gone insane?
To find a, a lover and through the words of pain (
One, two, three, four
)
We've never met, ooh (
One, two, one, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty
[Chorus]
I feel empty
Woah, I feel empty
So empty
(
One, two, three, four
)
When I lick my lips (When I close my eyes)
I can taste your smile (When I close my eyes)
My heart starts to race (When I close my eyes)
I can taste your smile (When I close my eyes)[Post-Chorus]
(
One, two, three, four
)
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty
[Chorus]
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(
One, two, three, four
)
[Outro]
(One, two, one, two, three, four)
(When I close my eyes)
(When I close my eyes)
(When I close my eyes)
(When I close my eyes)
(
Four, three, two, one
)
(Damn, disconnected)
