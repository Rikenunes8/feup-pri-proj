My body is calling out for ya, bad boy
I get the feeling that I just wanna be with ya
Maybe I'm a freak and I don't really give a damn
I'm crazy as a motherfucker, bet that on your man
[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
If you like what you see, end your curiosity
Let your mind roam free, won't you pay attention please?
What I gotta do to get you to want my body?
Quarter past three, I'm ready to leave the party

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
I'm not ashamed of my beauty, you can see what I got
(Shit, might I freak ya out, 'magine if I work ya out)
If I get on top, you're gonna lose your mind
(The way I put it down on you, you know should be a crime)
[Verse 3: Danja]
I understand, that you don't got no man
And I just want to take your hand
And I need you to understand
That, that, that I, I got everything perfect
When I take one, get it all inside
Work that body, get it all poppin' (You got it)
[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
If you like what you see (oh), end your curiosity
Let your mind roam free, won't ya pay attention please? (Please)

Let your mind roam free, won't you pay attention please? (Yeah)[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears & (Danja)]
Get naked, get naked (Eh), get naked (Ha), get naked (Eh)

Get naked (Ha), get naked (Eh), get naked (Ha), get naked (Eh)
