[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a 
bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It's not hot
That you be callin' me, stressin' me, pagin' my beeper
You're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes
And then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
So, what - you bought a pair of shoes
What, now I guess you think I owe you? (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'd give 'em back to be through wit' you
And so, what? My mama liked you (Liked you)
What, now I guess you think I will too? (Will do too)
Even if the Pope said he liked you too
I don't really care, 'cause you're a bug a boo
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo (A bug a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
 (Hey)
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's not hot
That when I'm blockin' your phone number
You call me over your best friend's house
And it's not hot
That I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you trackin' me down
You need to chill out with that mess
'Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed
'Cause every time my phone rings, it seems to be you
And I'm prayin' that it is someone else
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
So, what - you bought a pair of shoes
What, now I guess you think I owe you? (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'd give 'em back to be through wit' you
And so, what? (So, what?) My mama liked you
What, now I guess you think I will too? (Oh, oh-ooh)
Even if the Pope said he liked you too
I don't give a damn, 'cause you're a bug a boo
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Whoa)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
 (Cut the phone poles)
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo (Bug a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block (Oh-oh)
Have AOL make my emails stop
 (Oh-ooh-whoa)
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?[Bridge: Kelly]
When you call me on the phone, you're buggin' me
When you follow me around, you're buggin' me
Everything you do be bugging me
You're buggin' me, you're buggin' me
When you show up at my door, you're buggin' me
When you open up your mouth, you're buggin' me
Every time I see your face, you're buggin' me
You're buggin' me, you're buggin' me
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Throw out my pager)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles 
 (Turn my phone off)
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo (A bug a boo), a bug a boo (A bug a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block (Oh)
Have AOL make my emails stop
 (Whoa)
'Cause you a bug a boo (Hey)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool? (Yeah)
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (I realize I don't want you)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move (You're stressin' me out, doin' what you do)
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo (Oh yeah)
I wanna put your number on the call block (I regret the day that I met you, oh)
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool? (Oh, bug a boo)
