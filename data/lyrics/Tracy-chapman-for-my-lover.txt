[Hook]
Two weeks in a Virginia jail
For my lover, for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover for my lover
[Verse]
And everybody thinks that I'm the fool
But they don't get any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
[Hook 2]
Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed
For my lover, for my lover
They dope me up, and I tell them lies
For my lover, for my lover
[Verse]
And everybody thinks that I'm the fool
But they don't get any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
[Bridge]
I follow my heart
And leave my head to ponder
Deep in this love
No man can shake
I follow my heart
And leave my mind to wonder
Is this love worth
The sacrifices I make?
