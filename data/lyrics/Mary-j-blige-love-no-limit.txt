[Verse 1]
Baby, there's no need to tell you
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you
So you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time
I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I bring
I wanna give you all my love
[Chorus]
Loving you (That's all I wanna do)
Every day (And every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit (My love is yours)
Loving you (That's all I wanna do)
Every day (And every minute, every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit (My love is yours)
[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm in need of your love
And you got that touch that I need so much
And I am about to explode
Freely, completely
Everything you want, I'll be
Good love down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop
[Chorus]
Loving you (That's all I wanna do)
Every day (And every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit (My love is yours)
Loving you (That's all I wanna do)
Every day (And every minute, every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
[Bridge]
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you, said loving you
Is all that I, all that I wanna do
Baby, baby, baby, hey[Extended Chorus]
Loving you (I'm loving you)
Every day (Every day)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
Loving you (Loving you)
Every day (Every day, every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit (Don't look no more, don't look no more)
Loving you (Loving you)
Every day (Every day)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
Loving you (Loving you)
