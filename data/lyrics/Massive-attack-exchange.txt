[Chorus: Horace Andy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
You see a man's face
But you don't see his heart
You see a man's face
You will never know his thoughts
[Verse: Horace Andy]
Everywhere you go
There's a man to say love
Never neither, never neither take it to heart
For your heart is your heart
And your thoughts is your thoughts
Never mix love with hatred
[Chorus: Horace Andy]
You see a man's face
You will never see his heart
You see a man's face
But you will never know his thoughts
You see a man's face
You will never know his thoughts
You see a man's face
