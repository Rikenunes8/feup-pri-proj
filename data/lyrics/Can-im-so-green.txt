And it's all the pain that men hold
Looking for the, shouldn't speak
Just like ending my home
Smiling face like having
Those lights becoming a burning
Those lights they got home
Those lights that make you make a home again
Those lights bring back hair
Yes, I feel everything
I'm so green, I'm so green
Yes, I feel everything you say
Yes, I feel as you said
Trace lights, they're just going short all the time
Take back any, sense to grey
I'm so green, yeah, I'm so green
I'm so green, I'm so green
I feel everything
I feel everything you say
I feel everything you hear
I feel everything you hear
I'm gonna get them
I feel everything
I feel everything
I feel everything
In place with the gold
In with the gold
In with the gold
In with the gold
I feel the end
I feel the end
Where the place that they go
Where the place takes to youI better never step on quicksand
I better never step on quicksand
I better never step on quicksand
I better never step on quicksand
I better never step on quicksand
I better never step on quicksand
I better never step on quicksand
