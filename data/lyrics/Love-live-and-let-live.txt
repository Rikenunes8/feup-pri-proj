[Verse 1]
Oh, the snot has caked against my pants
It has turned into crystal
There's a bluebird sitting on a branch
I guess I'll take my pistol
I've got it in my hand
Because he's on my land
[Chorus]
And so the story ended
Do you know it oh so well
Well should you need I'll tell you
The
End, end, end, end, end, end, end, end
And...
[Verse 2]
Yes I've seen you sitting on the couch
I recognize your artillery
I have seen you many times before
Once when I was an Indian
And I was on my land
Why can't you understand
[Chorus]
And so the story ended
Do you know it oh so well
Well should you need I'll tell you
The
End, end, end, end, end, end, end, end
And...[Chorus 2]
Served my time
Served it well
You made my soul a cell
[Bridge]
Write the rules
In the sky
But ask your leaders
Why, Why
[Verse 1]
Oh, the snot has caked against my pants
It has turned into crystal
There's a bluebird sitting on a branch
I guess I'll take my pistol
I've got it in my hand
Because he's on my land
[Chorus]
And so the story ended
Do you know it oh so well
Well should you need I'll tell you
The
End, end, end, end, end, end, end, end
And...[Chorus 2]
Served my time
Served it well
You made my soul a cell
