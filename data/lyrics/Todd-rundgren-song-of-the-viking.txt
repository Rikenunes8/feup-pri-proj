I am a Viking of some note
Knut's my name and here I float
Out on the sea in a great big boat
And I'm the one who beats the drum in time
To stroke the oars that drive our galleons on
And while we rowed we had our song
And we had our god and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause
Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale
Down went a third when she rammed on a whale
Though we despaired we could not fail
And through it all we never faltered
Late at night I lay on deck
Wondering why I risk my neck
Picture myself in a sinking wreck
And down I'm going not knowing why
I just can't quite recall the reason why
It's such a drag to carry on
But there was a cause, but there was a cause
Still there was a reason, reason
If you like I'll be your Viking
Sit you down to a Nordic meal
Give you strength that you might wield
The Viking sword and the Viking shield
And off we'll sail in mighty ships of yore
Perhaps we shouldn't let our hands get sore
We need someone to pull the oars
And to do the chores
So we need a cause
We need a reason, reason why
