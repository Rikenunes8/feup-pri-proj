[Verse 1]
Fun for an hour when the hour's gone
Can one trick nights feed 40 days?
In my bed at the break of dawn
She shivered like a vein slashed bright and new
[Chorus]
She's got the radioactive
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
She's got the radioactive
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
[Verse 2]
Grip force the vials, strip the locks
Smash the set and slash the beds
And when it looks like a wife's ex-plot
We'll cover all the rugs with cheap perfume
[Chorus]
She's got the radioactive
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
She's got the radioactive
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
[Outro]
Like a docent's lisp
(She's got the radioactive)
Like a damsel's spit
Like a dry gin's twist
(And it makes me feel okay)
Of lime
(I don't feel okay)
Like a poor old serf
(She's got the radioactive)
Like a poke's dull spurs
Like a pastor's flock
(And it makes me feel okay)
No church
(I don't feel okay)
