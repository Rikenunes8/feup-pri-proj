[Verse 1]
One trial down in Spanos County
Ladies always turn up to watch them fall
And the hands they bind you
They bind you like you want to be broken in
But the land is coming babe
It's coming up golden
Gold and silver streaks
[Chorus]
When you hit them
You can't buy sand
In the gross land
Don't say what
To make 'em feel
[Verse 2]
They got take it off my wrists
Jacob you move up my wrists
Jacob you move
When you move
You don't move
You don't move
[Chorus]
Alright I want a cigarette
All these trials and things they try to do
While wondering for why we're insane
Damn land ho, won't you?
