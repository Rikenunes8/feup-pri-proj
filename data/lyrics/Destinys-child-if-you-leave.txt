[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me
[Verse 1: Beyoncé & 
Kelly
]
I peeped game long time ago
When he told me, 
he’s never seen that chick before
He wouldn't give me no explanation
'Cause he knows when I pack my bags
It ain't for no vacation, so
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm leavin' his ass alone
(Oh, I'm gone; 
Oh, I'm movin' on my way
)
He's history, to me
 (He's history)
See, the game is over, he'll see:
A girl's gotta 
do what she's gotta do
[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child / (Beyoncé)]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word (Word)
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away (We're gonna hide away)
Oh, just you and me
If you leave her, I'll leave him (Leave him)
We'll pack our bags (Pack our bags)
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place (Far away)
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me
[Verse 2: R.L. & 
Next
]
I called 612-555-2422 to find you
I packed my bags, gassed up the Jag
Even told my dad, you're the finest girl I never had
Cancelled my lady
Had to miss her page-mail
Know it might sound crazy
But say you'll be my baby
She crushed my new Benz
Slept with my best friend
Spent all my ends
It's got to end[Bridge: Beyoncé, (Destiny's Child), 
R.L.
, (
Next
)]
Ooh, how do I know you won't hurt me like he has?
(I know you say you want me back)
You've gotta have faith in me
You know I do, yeah 
I'd never play ya, baby
'Cause my love is all right
 (
Is all you'll ever need
)
'Cause I need someone for me
This love was meant to be
It's our destiny
[Beyonce & R.L.]
Just run away with me, oh-ho
[Chorus 2: Next (R.L. / Beyoncé)]
If you leave him, I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word (Our destiny is to be together, baby)
Let's go far away (Oh-ho), to another place
Let's hide away (I wanna know)
Oh, just you and me (
Oh, if you leave her
