[Verse 1]
When you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
When you miss me
In your dreams, does your lover have my face?
[Chorus 1]
Ah, when you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
Ah, when you miss me
In your dreams, does your lover have my face?
[Verse 2]
It's the morning
And the mourning, is it dawning on me too?
I'd no warning
Just a condolence card to tell me that we're through
[Chorus 2]
Ah, it's the morning
And the mourning, is it dawning on me too?
Ah, I had no warning
Just a condolence card to tell me that we're through
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
When you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
When you miss me
In your dreams, does my lover have your face?
[Chorus 1]
Ah, when you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
Ah, when you miss me
In your dreams, does your lover have my face?
