[Verse 1]
My mind is unwilling and your flesh is so weak
Do my movements betray the secrets I think?
I always stand by walls and try to humour fools
[Chorus]
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
[Verse 2]
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
