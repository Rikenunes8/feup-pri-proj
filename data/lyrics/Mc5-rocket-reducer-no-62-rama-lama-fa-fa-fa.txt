After some good tokes and a six pack
We can sock 'em out for you
Till you're flat on your back
You know I got to keep it up
Cause I'm a natural man
I'm a born hell raiser
And I don't give a damn
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you
Workin' here before your momma
Soakin wet
You think you're satisfied
You ain't seen nothing yet
I said Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am!
I'm a born ass pincher
And I don't give a damn
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you
Lead…
Rama lama fa fa fa…
You can lay it down on me, momma
Any old time
We can shimmy so good
We'll both be stoned O-Mind
I'm irresistably bad
The cooles' what am
Robin Tyner's the name
And I kick out the jamsI'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man for you
