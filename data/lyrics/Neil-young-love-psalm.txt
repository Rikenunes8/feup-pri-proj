Surrender my passion
Give up all I've got
There's no mixed emotion
You're all that I want
The wind will continue
Thunder and rain
Will fall where my footsteps
Have all washed away

And I pray for love tonight
And I pray, pray, pray, don't give up the fight
I'd rather die than surrender
The road that I travel
Is nearing the end
I've got no regrets
I've got nothing left
Birds will keep singing
Sun will still shine
And light up the spaces
My shadow made blind

Pray, pray, pray, pray for love tonight
Yes, I pray, pray, pray, don't give up the fight
Oh, I'd rather die than surrender

I've lived every moment
Like it was the last
There's nothing that I've said
That I would take back
The tide goes out
And comes back in
And brings with it mercy
To forgive all my sins

Yes, I pray, pray, pray, pray for love tonight
And I pray, pray, pray, don't give up the fight
I'd rather die than surrender
Than surrender, surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender
I'd rather die
