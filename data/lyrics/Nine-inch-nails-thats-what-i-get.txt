[Verse 1]
Just when everything was making sense
You took away all my self-confidence
Now all that I've been hearing must be true
I guess I'm not the only boy for you
[Chorus]
But that's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
[Verse 2]
How can you turn me into this?
After you just taught me how to kiss you?
I told you I'd never say goodbye
Now I'm slipping on the tears you've made me cry
[Chorus]
But that's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
[Bridge]
Why does it come as a surprise?
To think that I was so na√Øve
Maybe didn't mean that much
But it meant everything to me
[Chorus]
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
