[Verse 1]
Heaven is a truck
It got stuck
On the breeze
Ask the driver nicely, I need a lift
I need release
The sand in the boats
On the rose-covered floats
[Chorus 1]
She is the queen of the Castle California, thrill
[Verse 2]
I know arcs can't fly
I know the sharks, they don't have wings
But lady, you need some cold advice about a few things
Loosen my dress
Tie me up just like all the rest
[Chorus 2]
She is the queen of the Casa Pasadena (House of California), thrill
She is the queen of the Casa Pasadena (House of California), thrill
She is the queen of the Casa Pasadena (House of California), thrills
