[Verse 1]
What's the matter, Mary Jane?
You had a hard day
As you place the "Don't Disturb" sign on the door
You lost your place in line again, what a pity
You never seem to wanna dance anymore
[Chorus]
It's a long way down
On this roller coaster
The last chance streetcar
Went off the track
And you're on it
[Verse 2]
I hear you're counting sheep again, Mary Jane
What's the point of trying to dream anymore?
I hear you're losing weight again, Mary Jane
Do you ever wonder who you're losin' it for?
[Chorus]
Well, it's full speed, baby
In the wrong direction
There's a few more bruises
If that's the way you insist on heading
[Verse 3]
Please be honest, Mary Jane
Are you happy?
Please don't censor your tears
[Chorus]
You're the sweet crusader
And you're on your way
You're the last great innocent
And that's why
I love you
[Verse 4]
So take this moment, Mary Jane
And be selfish
Worry not about the cars that go by
'Cause all that matters, Mary Jane, is your freedom
So, keep warm, my dear, keep dry[Outro]
Tell me, tell me
What's the matter, Mary Jane?
Tell me, tell me
Please be honest, Mary Jane
Tell me
