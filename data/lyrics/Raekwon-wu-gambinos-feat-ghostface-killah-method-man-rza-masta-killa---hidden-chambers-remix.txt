And in our line of work, we need all the help we can get
Tony Wing's the name
He works for a drug ring in Central America
Who wants to kill him?
No information, say yes or no
One-point-five million
All right, you get what you want, money's no object
They're all clean, no serial numbers, untraceable
And they're explosive-head bullets, your favorite
Yo, yo, yo, get your fuckin', yo, that's made of glass, man
Get your big Avias off my mom's table, man
I felt someone walk over my grave
You want to change your mind?
Niggas is greedy, man, damn
Big ass shits
Yo, man, you ain't smokin' no more weed in here, man
Chill, man
Bobby Steels
(Somebody go to the store, man, fuck that)
'Sup, kid?
Yo
Let's cut the pie five ways
Mmm
We came off with two mil', kid, fast (Noodles, Rollie Fingers)
No doubt, comin' through
La Cosa Nostra
Johnny Blaze, Lou Diamonds (Represent for my peoples)
Tony Starks
Universal frontier
Original bloodclat bad boys (Check it out)
Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one, check it

Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotty
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that ho pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu, yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh, you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, six-shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing
This rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin
Isle, bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze
This goes for niggas who know
Wu will grow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool, papa, seen you with enough shit
Back at the lab-a, crack's bagged up
Your niggas act up, what? Blow up they workers if they have to
Se√±oritas fucking up a storm, buyin' gods margaritas
Sucking his dick up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime, nigga, jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally, wear a Figaro chain, yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah

Wu roll together as one (Solid gold throne is shinin')
I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one (Solid gold, check it, son, yo)

Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver linings
Double-breasted, bulletproof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest, and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get thrown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems?
The overfiend, light nova beam gleam, show 'em what a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The RZArector come to pay your ass a visit?
Local biochemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy millennium two thousand
Microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your adrenaline
Son, it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling, the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and
God stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
'Cause I strike like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respitorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks, my
Clan is hostile, got mad moss for blocks, so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of the gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks, pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfuckin' dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one

Yo, ayy, yo, I got this under my wing, move, give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Soley on Wu cords y'all heard Genius on Gef
So step back to the lab at high velocity
My team make hand-to-hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas, we know bestsellers become novels
The man rocking headbands, silk scarves, and jams
Early '80s British Walkers, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million?
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flour-heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot, kid?
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings, too bad you fucked up, dummies

Cosa, Cosa
Come on
