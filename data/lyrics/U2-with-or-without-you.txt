[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you
[Verse 2]
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-ah
I can't live with or without you
[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away[Verse 3]
My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose
[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you
[Interlude]
Ho-oh-oh-oh, ho-oh-oh-oh
Ho-oh-oh-oh-ohoh-oh
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you[Outro]
Hoooh-ooh-hoo-oohooh
Hoooh-ooh-hoo-oohooh
