[Intro: 50 Cent]
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
[Verse 1: 50 Cent & 
Tony Yayo
]
On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
But that's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath of my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try, you can't stop this
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coup√© cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
"50, you need some help?"
 Chill, Yayo, I got this
See, where I'm from, man, the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like "baby girl, I like them curves"
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'm a bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics 'cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood, they be trying to G us
Trying to holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging
We family, baby, kissing cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter than ya oven
I'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'til the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, go to ya husband[Hook: 50 Cent]
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Em said you gon' like my style
Dre said you gon' like my style
I said you gon' like my style
You will like how I break it down

You're not really, really ready, ready
The drama'll have ya ass in trauma, boy
You're not really, really ready, ready
My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
You're not really, really ready, ready
Them shells start popping, them bodies gets to dropping
You're not really, really ready
You think you're ready? You're not
Really, really ready, ready
