[Chorus]
Because we got to advance!
We got to advance!
There's nothing in our lives ever happened by chance!
We got to advance!
We got to advance!
We have got to advance!
[Verse: Levi 167]
Every generation after every generation
The American nation is hit with starvation
The exploitation, the quick sensation
Can only lead your mind to destroy the creation
Creation with the mind - destruction with the knife
Can only lead this planet to this present way of life
As you analyze the words to read the situation
You find yourself well off with this useful information
Information granted but your brain goes bling
And like the lights in computers the brain now thinks
From the mind, the omnipresent, to the underpaid peasant
The brain can piece the problems from the past and present
Got celebrity three, the future unknown
Information give us [?]
As you plug into the senses, the knowledge of the brain
The wise of the brain represented by the vein
[?] down to the letter
The heart, liver, stomach, kidney, lungs, etcetera
As you put them all together systematically
You got the body composition for you and me
So party people analyze the way I walk
There's a systematic action to the way I talk
This can go for any verse [?]
[?] but it's too complex
So, what happens next as I elaborate
On the name and the crew that we create
[Chorus]
[Verse: MC Quality]
[?]
The situation [?] reality
What's going on [?]
'Cause negative knowledge [?]
It's the knowledge of the fakers, wicked perpetrators
Living second lives as MC duplicators
They say [?] but it's all a dream
Losing [?] to the way things seem
You can bust these instructions with no interruption
The [?] function, its only destruction
[?] a fly reproduction
No sexy seduction to this introduction
[?] intellect
Jealous of the future, present and past
Pills, alcohol, cocaine and grass
[?]
It simply changes up on the way you feel
[?] for no one else
[?] ways to destroy themselves
Now what i'm tellin' you i know for a fact
[?]
[Chorus]The grand incredible Scott La Rock!
[Verse: KRS-One]
Every generation after every generation
All the world nation headed for annihilation
I say annihilation but I mean disintegration
An absolute wipe-off from the face of every nation
If you comprehend, you're allowed to ask a question
What could be the meaning of degeneration lesson
Lesson 1, lesson 2, lesson 3, lesson 4
A newly presented rap - a nuclear war
We have elevated far beyond the Rapper's Delight
So party people close your eyes and use the mind for the sight
We must understand the basic complications of life
Before the atom is split and the world is destroyed
If you're jamming to the sound, this is what I employ
To live it understand it and the knowledge of joy
This is the rhyme for the time, elevated from the mind
If you comprehend well it's a definite sign
Of the positive and negative electrical force
Of the whole world today, is on an advance course
C and O with the S H2O PO4
Can all be destroyed by a nuclear war
So to the black, white, Rican, Indian and Oriental
Muslims, Christians, Rastas, Jews, Gentiles
We've got to advance, we have got to advance
When the situation changes, we don't stand a chance
Cause every generation after every generation
We got to find ourselves in some worldwide celebration
Not with registration or a cotton plantation
But different presentation like more communication
The kids in graduation with lesser aggrivation
Will tell the other kids of this higher education
This higher education, which is really observation
Or more self-realization which will lead to relaxation
Not evacuation for fear of bomb mutation
Or packing helpless families send some army transportation
This army transportation has sent abbreviation
U.S.A., which means U Start Annihilation
I seem to read the phrase while I'm in this transportation
And those who think of war need to practice masturbation
I mean what I say cause I say what I mean
So listen to my voice, yes we have a choice[Chorus]
Because we got to advance!
We got to advance!
There's nothing in our lives ever happened by chance!
We got to advance!
We got to advance!
We have got to advance!
[Chorus]
Because we got to advance!
We got to advance!
There's nothing in our lives ever happened by chance!
We got to advance!
We got to advance!
We have got to advance!
The grand incredible Scott La Rock!
