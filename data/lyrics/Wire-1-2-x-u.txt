[Intro]
Alright, here it is again
And it's called
"1-2-X-U"
[Chorus]
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man, yeah
[Chorus]
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Smoking a fag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man, yeah
[Verse]
I've got you in a corner, I've got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, got you in a corner
Got you in a 
cottage
, got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, oh no, no, no
[Outro]
1-2-X-U
