[Verse 1]
So you want to be entertained?
Please look away, don't look away
We're not here cause we want to entertain
Go away, don't go away
Reality is the new fiction they say
Truth is truer these days, truth is man-made
If you're here cause you want to be entertained
Go away, please go away
[Chorus]
(Woah, oh, oh) If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial
[Verse 2]
You come around looking 1984
You're such a bore, 1984
Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore
It's better than before
It's better than before
You come around sounding 1972
You did nothing new with 1972
Where's the "fuck you"?
Where's the black and blue
Where's the black and blue
Where's the black and blue
[Chorus]
(Woah, oh, oh) If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial[Verse 3]
Hey! Look around they are lying to you
They are lying, they are lying and
Can't you see it is just a silly ruse?
They are lying, and I am lying too
All you want is entertainment
Rip me open it's freeing, yeah
[Chorus]
(Woah, oh, oh) If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial
[Bridge]
Don't drag me down
I'm not running down
Don't drag me down
I'm not running down
One, two, three!
If you want to take a shot at me get in line
One, two, three!
Baby, I've had all my shots and I'm fine
One, two, three!
If you haven't had enough of me, get in line
One, two, three!
You too deserve it now, it's all right
One, two, three!
We can drown in mediocrity, it feels sublime
One, two, three!
It feels like someone pushed rewind
One, two, three!
Give it to me easily, my feeble mind needs time
One, two, three!
Make it sweet and syrupy with rhymeDon't drag me down
I'm not falling down
Don't drag me down
I'm not falling down
[Chorus]
(Woah, oh, oh) If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial
[Outro]
(Woah, oh, oh) The grip of fear
(Woah, oh, oh) Is already here
(Woah, oh, oh) The lines are drawn
(Woah, oh, oh) 
Whose side are you on?
