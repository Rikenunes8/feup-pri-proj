[Verse 1]
They couldn't believe I did it, but I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you 
(For you)
I just dove inside it blind, couldn't see what swam inside
Thought that'd be romantic for you
[Verse 2]
Exchanged my vows and said it all, on the ledge prepared to fall
Even screaming, damn it, for you (Remember?)
My friends said you would play me, but I just said they're crazy
While I was crying frantic, was it true?
[Chorus]
Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)
[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me 
(Britney, let's go)
[Verse 3]
I sent you to Vegas with a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought "What could separate us?"
But it just seemed that Vegas only 
brought the player outta you
(Hey baby, what's your name?)
 (You think?)
[Verse 4]
Lavish homes and fancy cars, even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams, People and US Magazines
Tell me, who'd I do that for? Who?
[Chorus]
Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Ah, c'mon) (Goodbye)[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye) (C'mon)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright) (C'mon)
It's time for me 
(Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye) (C'mon)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay) (C'mon)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me 
(Britney, let's go)
 (Ah, c'mon)
[Bridge]
And don't you worry about our angels
All the magazines trying to intervene, saying things in the gossip section
They'll get good guidance and be trained well
Don't worry, I'll keep our little secret, but I ask this question
[Chorus]
Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)
[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me 
(Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me 
(Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me 
(Britney, let's go)
Yeah, ah, c'mon
