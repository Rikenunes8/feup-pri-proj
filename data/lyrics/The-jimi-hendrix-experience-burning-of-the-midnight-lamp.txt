[Verse 1]
The morning is dead, and the day is too
There's nothing left here to lead me but the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, alone
[Verse 2]
Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door
[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!
[Verse 3]
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion
Going through my mind
And soon enough, the time will tell
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell
[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!
