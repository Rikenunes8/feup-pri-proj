[Chorus]
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
[Verse 1]
Bad luck and trouble's my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten
[Chorus]
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
[Verse 2]
More wine and women is all I crave
Big bad women gonna carry me to my grave
[Chorus]
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Bad luck and trouble's been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten
[Outro]
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad sign
