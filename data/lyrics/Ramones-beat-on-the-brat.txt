[Chorus]
Beat on the brat, beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
Beat on the brat, beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
[Verse]
What can you do?
What can you do?
With a brat like that always on your back
What can you lose?
What can you do?
What can you do?
With a brat like that always on your back
What can you lose, lose?
[Chorus]
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
[Verse]
What can you do?
What can you do?
With a brat like that always on your back
What can you lose?
What can you do?
What can you do?
With a brat like that always on your back
What can you lose, lose?
