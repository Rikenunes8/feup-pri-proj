You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right, you're right
I feel all right
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
Cause I love you, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you too much
If you quit me, I'll go crazy
If you forget me, I'll go crazy
Cause I love you, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you too much
You've got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
You've got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
Cause I love you, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you too much
You've got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
You've got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
Cause I love you, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you too much
