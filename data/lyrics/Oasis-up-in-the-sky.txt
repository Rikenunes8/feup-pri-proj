[Verse 1]
Hey, you up in the sky
Learning to fly, tell me how high
Do you think you'd go
Before you start falling?
Hey you up in the tree
You wanna be me, well, that couldn't be
'Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling
[Chorus]
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
[Verse 2]
Hey you wearing the crown
Making no sound, I've heard you feel down
Well, that's just too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you stealing the light
I heard that the shine's gone out of your life
Well, that's just too bad
Welcome to my world
[Chorus]
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
[Bridge]
You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you breathe it in
How does it feel
When you're inside?
I can feel you
Can you feel me?
[Verse 1]
Hey you up in the sky
Learning to fly, tell me how high
Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling?
Hey you up in a tree
You wanna be me, well, that couldn't be
'Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling[Chorus]
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
[Bridge]
You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you breathe it in
How does it feel
When you're inside?
