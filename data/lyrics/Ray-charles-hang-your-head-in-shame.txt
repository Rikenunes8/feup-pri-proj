[Intro]
Oh, hang your head in shame
[Verse 1]
Oh, don't your conscience ever bother you
Every time you hear my name? (
Hear your name
)
Well, try and think of all that I've gone through
And then you hang your head in shame (
Oh, hang your head in shame
)
[Verse 2]
Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame (
All the blame
)
Well, you should go somewhere and hide your face
And then hang your head in shame (
Oh, hang your head in shame
)
[Verse 3]
When you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game? (
Little game
)
Now look back on all the harm you've done
And then you can hang your head in shame
[Verse 4]
I should hate you, but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
Oh, you'll be sorry, darling, yes, you will, will
And you're gonna hang your head in shame
[Outro]
And hang your head in shame
