[Intro]
Elevator! Goin' up!
[Verse 1]
In the gleamin' corridor of the 51st floor
The money can be made if you really want some more
Executive decision, at clinical precision
Jumping from the windows, filled with indecision
[Chorus]
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Coke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
[Verse 2]
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You don't need a launderette, you can take 'em to the vet!
[Chorus]
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Coke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
[Verse 3]
Coca-Cola advertising and cocaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper, they're crazy
Yeah, 
suit your life, maybe so
In the White House, I know
All over Berlin, they do it for years
And in Manhattan
[Bridge]
Comin' through the door is a snub nose forty four
The barrel can't snort, it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
You're leapin' from the windows sayin'
"Don't give me none of this!"[Chorus]
Coke adds life, advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Coke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
[Outro]
Hit the deck!
