Come back from the dead
You left my heart here
Say what you will and won't forget
Express disappointment
Speak your regrets, yeah
Oh, baby, call out my name
I'll be where you are
I'll be very still
Step down to my heart and mend this broken
If only you'd wake up from your constant possum playing
If only you'd wake up
I'm begging you sugar, have some leniency
Call the president and ask him, baby
To pardon me and bring you back to me
And mend this broken
If only you'd quit this nonsense of your possum playing
If only you'd wake up
Wake up baby
Wake up baby
