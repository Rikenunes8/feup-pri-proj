We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies make the dark clouds fade away
Some sunny day
(Hey, hey, hey)
Some sunny day
(Hey, hey, hey)
Some sunny day
(Hey, hey, hey)
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies make the dark clouds fade away
Some sunny day
(Hey, hey, hey)
Some sunny day
(Hey, hey, hey)
Some sunny day
(Hey, hey, hey)
