Dickie built a halfpipe in our backyard
Came home on a Monday, he was working hard
Early Tuesday morning he was almost done
Can’t wait til he’s finished, boy will this be fun

We watched him hammer
We watched him saw
And as the sun set Tuesday night we stood in awe
Wednesday morning should have been a holiday
Now we can’t keep the neighbor kids away (hey!) (hey!)

Eric built a train set on our patio
At night we light the lights and watch him go, go, go
Planted lots of flowers and it looks real keen
Now if he’d just learn to keep his bedroom clean

We watched him hammer
We watched him saw
And as the sun set Tuesday night we stood in awe
Wednesday morning should have been a holiday
Now we can’t keep the neighbor kids away (hey!) (hey!)
(Aw, play it!)
(Here we go now!)

Kathy made us dinner and it smelled real great
We all sat down to pork chops and we ate, ate, ate
The corn was mighty tasty and the wine was too
We ate and ate and ate until we all turned blue

We watched her hammer
We watched her saw
And as the sun set Tuesday night we stood in awe
Wednesday morning should have been a holiday
Now we can’t keep the neighbor dogs away (hey) (hey)
