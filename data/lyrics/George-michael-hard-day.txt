[Intro]
Don’t bring me down
Don’t bring me down
Don’t bring me down
[Verse 1]
I’ve never been one for playin’ games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Somethin’ like, “Bang bang, you’re dead”
Couldn’t we just make love instead?
Say yes because it’s what we do best
And I’ve had such a hard day
[Chorus]
Take me where their eyes can’t find us
Without you I may as well just...
[Verse 2]
How much do I have to say?
What more do you have to see?
What will it take to make you love me?
Well you’re not the first, you’re not the last
You’re not even the one who loves me the best
But all I think about is you, oh
[Chorus]
So take me where their eyes can’t find us
Without you I may as well just...
So take me where their eyes can’t find us
Without you I may as well just...
[Hook]
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Please don't wander from my door
[Verse 3]
I’ve never been one for playin’ games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Somethin’ like, “Bang bang, you’re dead”
Couldn’t we just make love instead?
Say yes because it’s what we do best
And I’ve had such a hard day[Hook]
(Don’t bring me down)
So don’t bring me down
Won’t ya give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now!
Don’t bring me down
Don’t bring me down
Don’t bring me down
[Verse 4]
Sweet little boy with oh, such a big mouth
Harsh words can get (don’t bring me down) you into hot water
When people don’t understand ya baby
I’m always (don’t bring me down) here for ya
And I, and I will never (don’t bring me down) bring you down, down, down, down, down my (don’t bring me down) baby
[Outro]
Trust me
(Don’t bring me down)
I want you to trust me
Oh trust me
‘Cause I won’t bring you down
(Don’t bring me down)
I won’t bring you down
Do you trust me?
Yeah
