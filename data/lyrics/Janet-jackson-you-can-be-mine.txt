[Chorus]
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
[Verse 1]
Hey, baby
I like your style
I'd like to hang around
If you're good
Look what you'll find
I'll let you, you be mine
[Chorus]
You can be mine
If you're good
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
Wish you would
You can be mine
You can be mine
[Verse 2]
Not in front
Never behind
Always just right on time
Always thinking
Man with a mind
Ready to please me
That's my type
[Chorus]
You can be mine
You're so good
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
Wish you would
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
Make a move
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
I really wish you would
You can be mine
You can be mine
Whatcha gonna do?[Bridge]
Better get on your job now
Time to go to work
If you want to be mine
Better get on your job now
Time to make me happy
If you want to be mine
Clap your hands, uh
Be mine
[Chorus]
You can be mine
You're so good
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
Really wish you would
You can be mine (Be mine)
You can be mine
Make the move
You can be mine
Should be mine
You can be mine
Yeah, yeah
You can be mine
Should be mine, baby[Post-Chorus]
Jellybean, jellybean

Just look what he's doing to be mine
You get a kick out of it
Baby, you can be mine
You can be mine
[Outro]
Fellas, help me out
