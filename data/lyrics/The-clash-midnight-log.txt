Working for the devil, you'll have to pay his tax
That means going to see him down among the racks
You don't believe in him, but he can wait for you
You do his work so fine he'll remember you
He'll remember you
Worried for my friend as he shows me round the flat
Where I don't want to find him, his lips and eyelids black
He don't believe my speech that lines can and should be drawn
Like if he had a shotgun the barrels would be sawn
The barrels would be sawn
Swallowed by the river, swollen by the rains
That leaking old computer of fingerprints and names
Swimming in the river that floods the neighborhood
I would call to you but it would do no good
But it would do no good
Voting for the law that's the general occupation

Cooking up the books a respected occupation
The anchor and foundation of multi-corporations
They don't believe in crime, they don't know that it exists
But to understand what's right and wrong, the lawyers work in shifts
The lawyers work in shifts
And speaking of the devil, he ain't been seen for years
'Cept every twenty minutes he zooms between me ears
I don't believe in books, but I read them all the time
For ciphers to the riddles and reasons to the rhymes
Reasons to the rhymes
