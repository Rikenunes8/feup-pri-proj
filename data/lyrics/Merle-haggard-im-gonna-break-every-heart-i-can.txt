[Verse]
I'm gonna break every heart I can
I'll be a find-'em-fool-'em man
I'm gonna dedicate my whole life to this one plan
Well, if I live and have enough time
I'll get 
even
 with the womankind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna think up a lot of good lies
I'm gonna laugh when a woman cries
I'm gonna have myself a style to recognize
I'm gonna travel all around the world
I'll be a threat to the sweetest girl
I'm gonna break every heart I can or my name ain't Merle
Well, if I never get around to you
You're gonna know about the things I do
They're gonna tell about the harm I've done on the latest news
Because if I live and have enough time
I'll get even with the womankind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna break every heart I can
I'll be a love-'em-and-leave-'em man
I'm gonna dedicate my whole life to this one plan
Well, if I live and have enough time
I'll get even with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
