Each of these
My three babies
I will carry with me
For myself
I ask no one else will be
Mother to these three
And of course
I'm like a wild horse
But there's no other way I could be
Water and feed
Are not tools that I need
For the thing that I've chosen to be
In my soul
My blood and my bones
I have wrapped your cold bodies around me
The face on you
The smell of you
Will always be with me
Each of these
My three babies
I was not willing to leave
Though I tried
I blasphemed and denied
I know they will be returned to me
Each of these
My babies
Have brought you closer to me
No longer mad like a horse
I'm still wild, but not lost
From the thing that I've chosen to be
And it's 'cause you've thrilled me
Silenced me, stilled me
Proved things I never believed
The face on you
The smell of you
Will always be with meEach of these
My three babies
I will carry with me
For myself
I ask no one else will be
Mother to these three
