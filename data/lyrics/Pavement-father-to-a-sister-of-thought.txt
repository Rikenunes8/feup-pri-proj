[Verse 1]
Rotten device, I’ll say it twice
I’m too much, I’m too much comforted here
Costs too much, too much, we’ll leave you
Everywhere eyes, nowhere to die
No place to shove your sharpened heel
I’m looking, looking for a
Tired face in case you wanted to go
[Chorus]
I know, I’m breathing in to the end
[Break]
[Verse 2]
Calling the bluffs, talking so tough
Goodbye to the ugly steeple fear
Good times for ever after
I’m just a man, you see who I am
I’m binding my hooks and open the books
Dirty black hearts
Angel of Corpus Christi
You’re so misty
, 
tell me what I want to hear
[Chorus]
I know, I'm reeling in
I know, I'm reeling in to the end
To the end
To the end
To the end
[Outro]
I know I'll never know
I know I'll never know
