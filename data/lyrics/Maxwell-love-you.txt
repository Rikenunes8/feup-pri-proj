[Intro]
It's you, it's you
[Verse 1]
You come out from nowhere, disappear and reappear
Houdini would be very proud
I can speculate your fears, wonder on your tears
But I just wanna hear your sound
And I know you love to live extremes
Your sword is made above your dreams
But tell me who's cut now
There's a road that's paved and made
With signs along the way
Come through somehow
[Chorus]
I can be anything you want me to be
I just wanna love you
Show you exactly what you mean to me
Honey, let me love you
[Verse 2]
Listen to the way I feel
When love can change you, love arranges you
Heaven blessed the day God sent you here
Hoping that love don't disappear
Feel you in ways I can't understand
Honey, baby, tell me I can be your man
[Chorus]
Let me be anything you want me to be
Baby, let me love you
Show you exactly what you mean to me
Honey, let me love you
Love you now, love you now
[Bridge]
And even after years, I need you when you don't
I remain more stubborn than I ever was before
I bear the witness, bear the witness for you, girl
All that is good, it's 'cause of you I'm in the worldI'll never go, I'm frozen, I'm standing here
Won't move until the day I get you near
Hear me when I say, you're the one I want
If you take this rib, don't let it go
Baby, don't leave or ever go, no, no
