[Verse 1]
I want you back again
I want your love again
I know you find it hard to reason with me
But this time it's different, darling you'll see
[Chorus]
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
[Verse 2]
You said we are through before
You walked out on me before
I tried to tell you but you didn't want to know
This time you're different and determined to go
[Chorus]
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
[Verse 3]
I wait as the days go by
I long for the nights to go by
I hear the knock on my door that never comes
I hear the telephone that hasn't rung[Chorus]
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
You got to tell me you're coming back to me
