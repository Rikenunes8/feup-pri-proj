Well, now baby, tell me how do you do?
Ooh, Lord, baby, tell me how do you do?
Well, I wanna say, baby, I really got news for you
Well, now baby, tell me what is your name?
Ooh, Lord, baby, tell me what is your name?
Well, I'm in love with you, baby, hope that you feel the same

Well, now baby, I really want you by my side
Ooh, Lord, baby, swear I want you by my side
Well, you love in the morning, keep your daddy satisfied
Well, you're finally mine, you're really on the ball
Ooh, Lord, by your by, you're really on the ball
Well, you know I'll start running, oh Lord, babe

Rock, everybody rock, rock, rock
Everybody jump, jump, jump
Everybody wail, wail, wail
Everybody jump, jump, jump
Everybody, well, early in the morning

I said, wail, wail (Wail, wail)
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
I believe in you when you say I do

Babe, talk about your baby, you ought to be mine
Well, you can talk about your baby, but you ought to be mine
Well, she feels like an angel and it ought to be an angel of mine

Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Oh, Lord in the evening
Do it in the morning
Well, early in the morning
