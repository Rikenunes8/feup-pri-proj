[Chorus 1]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Well, you know what you done to me
You made me fall for you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Well you know you can make me do what you want me to
[Chorus 2]
Loving you, feelings started
But, i'm going to stop it
If i could, i surely would
I would roll up around you
If i thought it would do any good
[Chorus 1]
Why don't you tell the truth
Tell the truth
Well you know you can make me do what you want me to
[Chorus 2]
