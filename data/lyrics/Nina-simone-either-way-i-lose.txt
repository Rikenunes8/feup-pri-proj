If I stay, I know that I'ma share your love
And that I couldn't take
And if I go, we'll be apart
And I know my heart would surely break
So, what difference does it make, which one I choose?
Either way I lose
Though I know, my love is true
I'd die if you ever told me good-bye
Ever told me good-bye
And I know, she loves you too
She would do, the very same as I
What difference does it make, which one I choose?
Either way I lose
Either way I lose
EIther way I lose
