Yo, I'm checkin' for Left Eye man, oh God G
I don't know God, I don't know God, I don't know God
I don't really, really know, check my flow
My man Al B. Sure, 'He's In Effect Mode'
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get wit me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Speakin' of which, you know how I troop
Late Thursday night playin' ball at run and shoot
I see my girl Chilli in her Lexus Coupe
Sittin' pretty in dat hot pink suit
And bam, in through the door she struts
It's the lovely T-Boz with the ill haircut
But Left Eye's the dime piece, yeah you know
It's all good but I heard it was a hood
It's like that y'all, my name's Malik the Phife from freak
It's like that y'all, my name's Malik the Phife from freak
It's on the M I C R O P H O N E, I rule
TLC up in the house, Crazy Sexy Cool
Ya know what I'm sayin'
