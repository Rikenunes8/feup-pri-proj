[Verse 1]
Went down to the local 
gypsy
And I handed her the same line
"You know what I want from you
So honey, won't ya gimme number 9?"
[Refrain 1]
'Cause you know lately, I ain't feeling so great
Last time, she gave me love potion number 8
And you know, pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle, and I'll tear you all apart
[Verse 2]
The gypsy told me that the first thing that would happen
You get dizzy
Second thing
You better make sure that your boyfriend isn't busy
'Cause you won't wanna eat, and you won't wanna drink
You won't wanna talk, and you won't wanna think
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on this first date
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait
[Chorus]
I'll kiss you
Gonna corner you, and not let you go
I'll kiss you
Don't tell me nothing, I don't wanna know
T
widdly dee, and twiddly dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
[Verse 3]
Hopped into a taxi
Told the driver got to get me 'cross town
Killed the bottle, started seeing double
When the driver turned around
[Refrain 2]
And though I was a failure with love potion number 8
Number 9 was different, and the hour's getting late
Now, I'm standing on the corner
Everyone looks great to me
And if you come and get me, take me where I want to be[Chorus]
I'll kiss you
Gonna corner you, and not let you go
I'll kiss you
Don't tell me nothing, I don't wanna know
Twiddly dee, and twiddly dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
[Refrain 1]
'Cause you know lately, I ain't feeling so great
And last time, she gave me love potion number 8
And you know, pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle, and I'll tear you all apart
[Chorus]
I'll kiss you
Gonna corner you, and not let you go
I'll kiss you
Don't tell me nothing, I don't wanna know
Twiddly dee, and twiddly dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
[Refrain 3]
Oh, you know lately, I ain't feeling so great (
I'll kiss you
)
And last time, she gave me love potion number 8 (
I'll kiss you
)
And you know, pretty baby
Oh (
I'll kiss you
)
I don't wanna talk, and I don't wanna speak[Outro]
I'll kiss you
I'll kiss you
I'll kiss you...
