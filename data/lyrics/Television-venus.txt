[Verse 1]
It was a tight toy night, streets so bright
The room was so thin between my bones and skin
There stood another person who was a little surprised
To be face to face with a world so alive
[Chorus]
How I fell (Did you feel low?)
No (Huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo
[Verse 2]
You know it's all like some new kind of drug
My senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves
Broadway looked so medieval
It seemed to flap, like little pages
And I fell sideways laughing
With a friend from many stages
[Chorus]
How we felt (Did you feel low?)
Not at all (Huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo
[Verse 3]
Suddenly, my eyes went so soft and shaky
I knew there was pain, but pain is not aching
Then Richie, Richie said:
"Hey man, let's dress up like cops, think of what we could do"
But something, something
It said, "You'd better not"
[Chorus]
And I fell (Did you feel low?)
Nah (Huh?)
I stood up, walked out of the arms of Venus de Milo
