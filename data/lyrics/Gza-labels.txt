[Intro: RZA]
Lot of people, you know what I'm sayin'?
That be gettin' misinformed, thinkin' everythin' is everythin'
You could just get yourself a little deal, whatever
You know what I'm sayin'?
You gonna get on, you gonna get rich
And all these labels be tryin' to lure us in like spiders into the web
You know what I'm sayin'?
So sometimes, people gotta come out and speak up
And let people understand
That you know, you gotta read the labels, you gotta read the label
If you don't read the Label, you might get poisoned
[Masta Killa]
Bomb these niggas, God!
[Verse: GZA]
Tommy ain't my motherfuckin' boy!
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set, now you know God damn
I show 
livin' large
 niggas how to flip a 
Def Jam
And Ruff up the motherfuckin' House
 
'cause I smother
You Cold Chillin' motherfuckers, I still Warner Brother
I'm Ruthless, my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is Jive
, an old 
Sleeping Bag
 
Profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel, it wasn't from a 
Tuff City
Niggas be game, thinkin' that they lyrical surgeons
They know they mic's a phone to 
Virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic, you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like goin' to Venus drivin' a 
Mercury
The Capitol of this rugged slang is Wu-Tang!
Witty-Unpredictable Talent-And-Natural-Game
I Death Row an MC with mic cables
The Epic is that I Rush Associated Labels
From 
East, West
 to 
ATCO
, I bring it to a 
Next Plateau
But I keep it phat, though
Yo, I'm hittin' batters up with the Wild Pitch style
I even show an Uptown MCA style
Who thought he saw me on 4th & Broadway
But I was out on the Island, bombin' MC's all day
My Priority is that I'm First Priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for A&M, the Abbot and the Master!
Breakin' down your Pendulum
As I fiend MC's out with a blow that'll numb the a-
-ppendix, 
I'm holdin' more weight than Columbia
Index 
Interscope
, we 
RCA
Clan that's comin' with a plan to free a
Slave of a mental death, MC, don't panic
Throw that A&R nigga off the boat in the Atlantic
Now, who's the Bad Boy character?
 Not from 
Arista
But firin' weapons released on Geffen
So duck as I struck with the soul of Motown
My central broadcasting systems is low down
And Dirty, like that Bastard
It's gettin' drastic[Outro: GZA + (Masta Killa)]
Read the label and say it loud
Another Wu banger
Thirty-six chambers, through your area
(Yeah, the RZA, phat tracks on a disc)
RZA-razor-RZA-razor sharp
(Another Wu-Tang production, kid, comin' at ya)
