[Chorus]
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into a nightingale
My song will warm thy heart
Well I'll turn into a threshing machine
And tear thy bird apart
[Chorus]
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into a vampire
And kiss you on the neck
Well I'll turn into a silver cross
And send thee back to Heck
[Chorus]
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into a hydrogen bomb
And atomize the air
Well I'll turn into a cockroach
And you'll see if I care
[Chorus]
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will deeBut I'll turn into a supernova
And burn up everything
Well I'll turn into a black little hole
And you'll turn into string
[Chorus]
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
But I'll turn into God Himself
And then you'll come to me
Well I will not believe in you
And then where will you be?
[Chorus]
Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
