[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?
[Verse 2]
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
[Verse 3]
Touch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)
Feel how it trembles inside (Mhm)
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Doo-doo woah-oh
(Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
 (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
 (My father, you know he's cruel)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied
 (Never, never satisfied, why scream?)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why?)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
[Break]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
When doves cry (When doves cry, they cry)
Oh, no, oh
Oh, no, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
When doves cry
When doves cry (Hoo)
When doves cry (Hoo)
Baby, baby, baby, yeah[Outro]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
Don't cry
Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry
