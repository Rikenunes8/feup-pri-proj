Art-i-ficial
I know I'm artificial
But don't put the blame on me
I was reared with appliances
In a consumer society
When I put on my make-up
The pretty little mask not me
That's the way a girl should be
In a consumer society

My existence is elusive
The kind that is supported
By mechanical resources
My existence is elusive
The kind that is supported
By mechanical resources
I wanna be Instamatic
I wanna be a frozen pea
I wannna be dehydrated
