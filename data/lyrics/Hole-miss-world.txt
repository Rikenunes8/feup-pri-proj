[Intro]
I am the girl you know
Can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know
So sick, I cannot try
I am the one you want
Can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know
I lie and lie and lie
[Verse 1]
I'm Miss World
Somebody kill me
Kill me pills
No one cares, my friends
My friends
[Verse 2]
I'm Miss World
Watch me break
And watch me burn
No one is listening, my friends
Yeah
[Chorus]
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
[Verse 3]
Kill girls watch
When I eat ether
Suck me under
Maybe forever, my friends
Yeah
[Chorus]
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll cry in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll cry in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
My friend[Outro]
I am the girl you know
Can't look you in the eye
