[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"
[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (
Born this way
)
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (
Born this way
)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way
[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)
[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vuole fe yah (
Same DNA
)[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (
Born this way
)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
[Breakdown]
If we wanna make it country, baby, it's okay
'Cause I was born, I was born, I was born this way
From London, Paris, Japan, back to USA
Yeah, I was born on the road, I was born to be brave
[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave![Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (
Born this way
)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
[Outro]
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
Same DNA, but born this way
Same DNA, but born this way
