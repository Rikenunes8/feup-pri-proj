[Verse 1]
Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you
You're not the truth, no one could look as good as you
Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
Now are you lonely just like me?
[Chorus]
Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Please, baby
Pretty woman
Hey hey hey, pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
[Bridge]
'Cause I need you
And I'll treat you right
Come to me, baby
Be mine tonight
[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, pretty woman, stop awhile
(I'm gonna stop awhile)
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(Please, baby)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me, please baby, baby
(I'm not asking very much, baby just a)
Pretty woman
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, just give your smile to me
(Love me, love me, lady)
Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(Love me, love me, lady)
Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(Love me, lady, won't you stay with me?)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
(Well, then let me say it again)
Pretty woman, stop awhile
(Although I just met you, baby)
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(You don't know how I'm feeling)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
(I will take if you smile to me)
Pretty woman
