[Verse 1]
When the train rolls by
I'm going to be ready this time
When the boy gets that look in his eye
I'm going to be ready this time
When my momma says I look good in white
I'm going to be ready this time
[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready...ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love
[Verse 2]
I feel the wind blow through my hair
I'm going to be ready this time
I'll buy a ticket to anywhere
I'm going to be ready this time
You see it feels like I'm starting to care
And I'm going to be ready this time
[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready...ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love
Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready...ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love
Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready...ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love
