[Verse 1]
I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong, start doing right
You don't care about what I think
[Refrain]
Think I'll just stay here and drink
[Verse 2]
Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
[Refrain]
Think I'll just stay here and drink
[Verse 3]
Hey, listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
[Refrain]
I think I'll just stay here and drink
[Bridge]
Yessir
Here comes that piano
Yessir
[Verse 4]
Hey, hurtin' me now don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
[Refrain]
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Yeah
[Outro]
We're gone
