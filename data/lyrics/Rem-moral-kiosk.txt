[Verse 1]
Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock, but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head
[Chorus]
It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight
[Verse 2]
Scratch the scandals in the twilight
She was laughing like a Horae
Without being sour landslide
Take the steps to dash a roving eye
[Chorus]
It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight
[Verse 1]
Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head
[Chorus]
It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight
[Outro]
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight
