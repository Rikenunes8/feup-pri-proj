Come back baby, baby please don't go
Way I love you, I want the world to know
Come back baby, let's talk it over, one more time
Ah, this old world, well will fade one day
Said come back, baby, and don't go away now
Ah, come back baby, let's talk it over, one more time
Ah, come back baby, baby please don't go
The way I love you, I want the world to know
Come back baby, let's talk it over, one more time
One more time
