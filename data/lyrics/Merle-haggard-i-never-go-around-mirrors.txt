[Verse]
I can't stand to see a good man go to waste
One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
Oh it tears me up to see a grown man cry
[Chorus]
So I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
[Chorus]
I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
[Outro]
And it tears me up to see a grown man cry
