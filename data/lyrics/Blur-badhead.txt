[Verse 1]
So far I've not really stayed in touch
Well, you knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I get up around two from a lack of anything to do

And I might as well just grin and bear it
Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
And I might as well just grin and bear it
Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a bad head in the morning
So I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
You're like a bad head in the morning
And I know
