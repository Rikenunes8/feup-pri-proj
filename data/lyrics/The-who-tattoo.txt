[Verse 1]
Me and my brother were talking to each other
About what makes a man a man
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand
[Bridge]
Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair
[Verse 2]
So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed
[Pre-Chorus]
Welcome to my life, tattoo
I'm a man now, thanks to you
[Chorus]
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die
Tattoo
[Verse 3]
My dad beat me because mine said "Mother"
But my mother naturally liked it
 and beat my brother
Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude
And my mother thought that was extremely rude
[Pre-Chorus]
Welcome to my life, tattoo
We've a long time together, me and you
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Now I'm older, I'm tattooed all over
My wife is tattooed too
A rooty-toot-toot, rooty-tooty-toot-toot
Rooty-toot-toot tattoo too
To you
