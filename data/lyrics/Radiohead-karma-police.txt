[Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, 
he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
