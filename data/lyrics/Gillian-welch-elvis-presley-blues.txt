[Refrain]
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
[Verse 1]
Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem queen
And he shook it like a midnight rambler, baby
Like you never seen
Never seen
[Refrain]
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
[Verse 2]
'Cause he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
And he shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake
Soul at stake[Refrain]
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
[Verse 3]
He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
And he shook it and it shined like gold
And he shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul
Well bless my soul
[Bridge]
And he shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
[Refrain]
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
[Verse 1]
Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem queen
And he shook it like a midnight rambler, baby
Like you never seen
Never seen[Outro]
Like you never seen
Never seen
