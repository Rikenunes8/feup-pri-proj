[Verse 1]
Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you
Not out of spite or anger
But simply because it’s true
Now, I hope you won’t object to this
Giving back all of what you owe
The fewer words you have to waste on this
The sooner you can go
[Chorus]
Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take care of yourself, get plenty of rest
[Verse 2]
Nothing was delivered
But I can’t say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be
Yes, for telling all those lies
Now you must provide some answers
For what you sold that's not been received
And the sooner you come up with them
The sooner you can leave
[Chorus]
Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take care of yourself, get plenty of rest
[Verse 3]
Now you know nothing was delivered
And it’s up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made ev’rybody pay
No, nothing was delivered
Yes, ’n’ someone must explain
And as long as it takes to do this
Then that’s as long as you’ll remain
[Chorus]
Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take care of yourself and get plenty of rest
