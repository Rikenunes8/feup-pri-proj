[Verse]
Well now, there's two, there's two trains running
Well they aren't never, no, going my way
Well now, one run at midnight and the other one
Running just before day
It's running just before day[x2]
Oh Lord, sure enough they is
Oh well
Hmm hmm, ho ho
Somebody help me ho, with these blues
Well now, she's the one I'm loving, she's the one
I do hate to lose[x2]
Oh Lord, sure enough I do
Oh well
I been crazy, yes, I been a fool
I been crazy, oh, all of my life
Well I done fell in love with a
With another man's wife[x3]
Oh Lord, sure enough I done
Oh well
Lord, she's so long and tall
Till she weep like a willow tree
Well now, they say she's no good, but she's all right
She's all right with me
She's all right[x4]
