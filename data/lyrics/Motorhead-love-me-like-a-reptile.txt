Knew I had to bite you, baby
When I first laid eyes on you
That moment turned me on
I can't believe it's true
And I like to watch your body sway
I got no choice, I'm gonna twist your tail
Love me like a reptile, love me like a reptile
I'm gonna sink my fangs in you
Thunder lizard, stony eye
You got me hypnotised
Hot tongue breaks in and out
And I can't believe my eyes
And your soft white belly, next to mine
Scaly baby, see you shine
Love me like a reptile, love me like a reptile
You're a murder in disguise
Black mamba, murderer disguised
Baby, you're a rattlesnake
You know the way I feel
Feel you crawling up my back
You've got no love to steal
You know I've got my eyes on you
You're petrified, gonna stick like glue
Love me like a reptile, love me like a reptile
Shock you like an electric eel
Shock you like an electric eel
