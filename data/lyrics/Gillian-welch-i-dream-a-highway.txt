[Refrain 1]
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and rest my soul
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 1]
John, he's kicking out the footlights
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band
Lord, 
let me die with a hammer in my hand
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 2]
I think I'll move down into Memphis
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue
I lie and wait until the wagons come
And dream a highway back to you
[Verse 3]
The getaway kicking up cinders
An empty wagon full of rattling bones
Moon in the mirror on 
a three-hour jones
I dream a highway back to you
[Refrain 2]
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come arrest my soul
And I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 4]
Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram
I'll send a letter, don't know who I am
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 5]
I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight
Any second now, I'm gonna turn myself on
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray
I dream a highway back to you[Verse 6]
I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds
Fire-riding, wheeling when I laid 'em up
Drank whiskey with my water, sugar with my tea
My sails in rags with the 
staggers and the jags
I dream a highway back to you
[Refrain 3]
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision convalesced my soul
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 7]
Now give me some of what you're having
I'll take you as a viper into my head
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed
And I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 8]
Hang overhead from all directions
Radiation from the porcelain light
Blind and blistered by the morning white
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 9]
Sunday morning at the diner
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears
I watched the waitress for a thousand years
Saw a wheel inside a wheel,
 heard a call within a call
And I dreamed a highway back to you[Refrain 4]
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision 
convalesced my soul
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 10]
Step into the light, poor Lazarus
Don't lie alone behind the window shade
Let me see the mark death made
And I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you
[Verse 11]
What will sustain us through the winter?
Where did last year's lessons go?
Walk me out into the rain and snow
I dream a highway back to you
[Refrain 5]
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you
[Refrain 6]
Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to you
