[Verse 1]
I tried to tell you in the night
That with a girl like you I could do without guided tours
You tried to tell me in the day
That your leading exports were textiles and iron ore
[Chorus]
Hasta Mañana Monsieur
Were the only words that I knew for sure
Hasta Mañana Monsieur
Were the three little words that I knew you'd adore
[Verse 2]
Leaving my syntax back at school
I was thrown for a loss over gender and simple rules
You mentioned Kant and I was shocked, so shocked
You know, where I come from, none of the girls have such foul tongues
[Chorus]
Hasta Mañana Monsieur
Were the only words that I knew for sure
Hasta Mañana Monsieur
I'm gonna do it now
C'est la vie, c'est la mort,
 say no more, no no more
[Bridge]
It's all the same
Whether here or there or anywhere
There's them who have
And there are the others who have not
[Verse 3]
Kimono my house mon amour
I am sure that this motion don't need no accompanying words
Guess I was wrong because you've fled
Leaving me with my Michelin Guide and half-empty foreign bed
[Chorus] x2
Hasta Mañana Monsieur
Were the only words that I knew for sure
Hasta Mañana Monsieur
Were the three little words that I knew you'd adore
