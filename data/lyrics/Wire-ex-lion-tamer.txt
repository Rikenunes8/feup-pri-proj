[Verse 1]
There's great danger (danger)
For the loneliest ranger in town
No silver bullets (bullets)
Tonto's split the scene
[Chorus]
Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
[Verse 2]
There's great danger (danger)
At hand most caped crusader of all
No cloak of justice (justice)
Robin's quit the scene
[Chorus]
Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set
(TV) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set
(TV) Oh, why, don't ya, don't ya, don't ya?
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
(TV) Stay glued to your TV set
(TV) Oh, why, don't ya, don't ya, don't ya?
(TV) Stay glued to that and your TV set (TV)
