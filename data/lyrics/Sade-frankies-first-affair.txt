[Verse 1]
Frankie, didn't I tell you
You've got the world
In the palm of your hand
Frankie, didn't I tell you they're running
At your command
[Pre-Chorus]
You know the tricks
As if they're your invention
It wasn't your intention
Frankie to fall in the trap you made
[Chorus]
Oh oh, it's a crying shame, mmm
You left a trail of destruction
Heartbreaker, you know now
They really did care 'cause it's your first affair
[Verse 2]
Frankie, didn't I tell you that the lion
Would come in for the kill
Frankie, didn't I say he had power
Over your sweet skill
[Pre-Chorus]
So where is the laughter?
You spat right in their faces
Didn't I tell you Frankie
That you might run out of races
[Chorus]
Oh oh, it's a crying shame, mmm
You couldn't win the game
Heartbreaker this time (This time)
It's your first affair
[Bridge]
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
(It's your turn to cry, heartbreaker)
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
It's your turn to cry[Chorus]
It's a crying shame
Heartbreaker
You know now they really did care
'Cause it's your first affair
[Outro]
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
(It's your turn to cry, it's your turn to cry) wha da an dee da do
Wha da an dee da do, heartbreaker
(It's your turn to cry, it's your turn to cry)
Don't you realize they really, really, really did care
The party's over
Now you discover
It's your turn to cry
And don't you realize
Ooh ooh, it's the toughest thing, yes it is, yes it is
The party's over, it's your turn to cry
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
Mmm mmm
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
It's your first affair
