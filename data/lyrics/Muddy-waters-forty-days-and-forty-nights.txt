[Verse 1]
Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby left this town
Sun shinin' all day long
But the rain keep comin' down
She's my life, I need her so
Why she left, I just don't know
[Verse 2]
Forty days and forty nights
Since I set right down and cried
Keep rainin' all the time
But the river is runnin' dry
Lord, help me, it just ain't right
I love that girl with all of my might
[Verse 3]
Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby broke my heart
Searchin' for her everywhere
Like a blind man in the dark
Love can make a poor man rich
Or break his heart, I don't know which
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Forty days and forty nights
Like a ship out on the sea
Prayin' for her each night
That she would come back home to me
Life is love and love is right
I hope she come back home tonight
