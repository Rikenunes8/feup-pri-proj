[Verse 1]
I'm in love again
Been like this before
I'm in love again
This time's true, I'm sure
[Chorus]
Don't wanna end up like no nine-day wonder (Oh-oh, oh)
I've been hurt so many times before (Oh-oh, oh)
So my darling, I will never leave you (Oh-oh, oh)
It's in my blood to always love you more, love you more
[Verse 2]
It's my heart again (Oh-oh)
That drives me so wild (Oh-oh)
I just can't explain (Oh-oh)
Although, I'm not a child (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
So why would I cry if you ever left me? (Oh-oh, oh)
Maybe 'cause you're all I'm living for (Oh-oh, oh)
With every heartbeat, I want you madly (Oh-oh, oh)
It's in my blood to always love you more, love you more
[Verse 3]
Oh my love, again (Oh-oh)
What I say is true (Oh-oh)
Though it may sound plain (Oh-oh)
I love you
[Outro]
And it means more to me than life can offer (Oh-oh, oh)
And if this isn't true love, then, I am sure (Oh-oh, oh)
That after this love, there'll be no other (Oh-oh, oh)
Until the razor cuts
