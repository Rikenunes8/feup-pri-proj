[Verse 1]
Make me crazy, don't speak no sound
I want you to prove it to me in the nude
Addicted to the way you move
Honey, if anything ever should change in you
Don't worry, I'm standing still
I'll move in with the right of will
[Chorus]
This is the highest cost
Take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost
Will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town
Drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around
Will you forgive me?
[Verse 2]
I can't control the feeling
Girl, cause I know you're here
I feel you from the floor to the ceiling
Girl, I feel you when you comb your hair
Lady, when we lock it low ah ah
We get together, it's an overdose
I'm slipping, I'm here, I'm on my knees
I feel my heart's about to explode
[Chorus]
This is the highest cost
Take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost
Will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town
Drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around
Will you forgive me?
[Bridge 1]
Baby to tell the truth
When I'm sober I jones for you
When it's over, I'm overdue
Girl there's no one as bad, no one as bad as you[Middle 8]
You got me, you got me
You got me slipping around with it, around with it, oh why?
You got me sick with this love, baby
I'm so, I'm so in love, I can't come down
[Chorus]
This is the highest cost
Take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost (Baby)
Will you forgive me? (Will you forgive me?)
Asked out all over town (Oh)
Drags you and keeps you down (And I know)
Two times in a day around
Will you forgive me?
[Bridge 2]
You're my badhabit baby, you're my
You're taking my soul down to the letter O
Can't escape the way you got me locked out, baby
I gotta break from you, break from you, break from you
[Chorus]
This is the highest cost
Take you and make you off
Love you and leave you lost
Will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town (Asked out ooh)
Drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around
Will you forgive me?[Chorus]
Will you forgive me? (ooh)
Will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me?
Asked out all over town
Drags you and keeps you down
Two times in a day around
Will you forgive me?
[Outro]
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling huh
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling huh huh
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
I can't control the feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feel-

Feeling , feeling
