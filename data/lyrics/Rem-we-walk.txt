[Verse 1]
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, 
Marat's bathing
[Pre-Chorus]
We walk through the woods
We walk
[Verse 1]
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
[Pre-Chorus]
We walk through the woods
We walk
[Chorus]
Take oasis
Take oasis
Take oasis
Take oasis
[Verse 1]
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
[Pre-Chorus]
We walk through the woods
We walk
[Verse 1]
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
[Verse 1]
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing[Outro]
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Into the, oh, oh
Into the, oh, up
Up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up
