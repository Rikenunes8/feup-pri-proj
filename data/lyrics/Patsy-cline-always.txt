[Intro]
(Always, always, always)
[Verse 1]
I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always
Always
[Verse 2]
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
[Verse 2]
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
