[Verse 1]
I ain't ever gonna let you down
All you got to do is trust me
I would never make you some clown
Baby, why won't you trust me?
[Chorus 1]
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Don't let me down
I'm depending on you
[Verse 2]
Baby, if you can't change the world
Maybe you should just change yourself
You used to be such a sweet young girl
Why you wanna be someone else?
[Chorus 2]
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Is it too late now?
I'm depending on you[Chorus 1]
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Don't let me down
I'm depending on you
[Outro]
Yeah, I'm depending on you
Is it too late now?
I'm depending on you
I'm depending on you
I'm depending on you
Is it too late now?
I'm depending on you
