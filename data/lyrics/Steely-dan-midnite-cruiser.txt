[Verse 1]
Felonious, my old friend
Step on in and let me shake your hand
So glad that you're here again
For one more time
Let your madness run with mine
Streets still unseen, we'll find somehow
No time is better than now
[Chorus]
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
[Verse 2]
The world that we used to know
People tell me it don't turn no more
The places we used to go
Familiar faces that ain't smiling like before
The time of our time has come and gone
I fear we've been waiting too long
[Chorus]
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
[Instrumental break 2:17-3:08]
[Chorus]
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
[Outro]
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
Tell me where are you driving, midnight cruiser?
