[Verse 1]
Got hair in a girl that flows to her bones
And a comb in her pocket if the wind get blown
Stripes on her eyes when she walks slow
But her face fall down when she go, go, go
[Chorus]
Black tear falling
 on my lazy queen
Got a tattooed tit say "number 13"
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm...
[Verse 2]
Choir in the yard in the house next door
Where a grandma brought some songs from the shore
Six foot girl gonna sweat when she dig
Stand close to the fire when they light the pig
[Chorus]
Standing in her chinos shirt pulled off clean
Got a tattooed tit say "number 13"
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm...
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state
