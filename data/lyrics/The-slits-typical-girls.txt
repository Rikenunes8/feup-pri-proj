[Hook]
Don't create
Don't rebel
Have intuition
Can't decide
[Verse 1]
Typical girls get upset too quickly
Typical girls can't control themselves
Typical girls are so confusing
Typical girls, you can always tell
Typical girls don't think too clearly
Typical girls are unpredictable, predictable
[Chorus 1]
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well, well
[Verse 2]
Typical girls are looking for something
Typical girls fall under spells
Typical girls buy magazines
Typical girls feel like hell
Typical girls worry about spots, fat
And natural smells, stinky fake smells[Chorus]
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well, well
[Hook]
Don't create
Don't rebel
Have intuition
Can't decide
[Chorus 2]
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well
Can't decide what clothes to wear
[Verse 3]
Typical girls are sensitive
Typical girls are emotional
Typical girls are cruel and bewitching
But she's a femme fatalle
Typical girls stand by their man
Typical girls are really swell
Typical girls learn how to act shocked
Typical girls don't rebel[Chorus 3]
Who invented the typical girl?
Who's bringing out the new improved model?
And there's another marketing ploy
Typical girl gets the typical boy
Who invented the typical girl?
Who's bringing out the new improved model?
And there's another marketing ploy
Typical girl gets the typical boy
[Outro]
The typical boy gets the typical girl
The typical girl gets the typical boy
The typical boy gets the typical girl
The typical girl gets the typical boy
Are emotional
