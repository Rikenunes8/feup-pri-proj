The fire you like so much in me
Is the mark of someone adamantly free
But you can't stop yourself from wanting worse
'Cause nothing feeds a hunger like a thirst
Baby, I'm tired of fighting
I always wanted you
I broke up at the roadhouse
I wouldn't know you were alive
You haven't seen me for weeks now
It wouldn't shock you if I drove right out the back of your eyes
I can't be trusted
They're saying I can't be true
But I only wanted more than I knew
Baby, I'm tired of fighting
I always wanted you
I only wanted more than I knew
