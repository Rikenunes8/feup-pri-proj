[Verse 1]
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been
[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
[Verse 2]
You don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again
[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
