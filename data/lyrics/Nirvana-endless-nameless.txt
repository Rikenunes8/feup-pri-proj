[Verse 1]
Silence, here I am
Here I am, silent
Bright and clear, it's what I am
I have died
[Interlude]
Mother
Mother
Mother
Mother
[Verse 2]
Death and violence
Excitement, right here
Died, go to hell
Here I am, right here
Ow!
[Interlude]
Mother
No más
No más
Mamá
[Verse 3]
Death is what I am
Go to hell, go to jail
In back of that crime
Here I am, take a chance
Dead
Die
