[Intro]
Hey
[Verse 1]
Hey, what did I do?
Can't believe the fit I just threw
Stupid, hey, wanted the reaction
(Hey, wanted the reaction)
I remember the words
How I said them so they would hurt
But then (Hey), I regret my actions
(Hey, I regret my actions)
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could press rewind (Rewind the tape)
Redefine the line (Remake my fate)
Take it back in time just one day, hey
Hey
[Chorus]
So all I need is a time machine
A one way track
'Cause I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back
(Hey)[Verse 2]
Yeah, who's laughing now?
Didn't think you'd actually go
Stupid, hey, me and all my bitching
(Hey, me and all my bitching)
Second thoughts and regrets
Gonna alt, delete and reset
But then, hey, this ain't science fiction
(Hey, this ain't science fiction)
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could press rewind (Rewind the tape)
Redefine the line (Remake my fate)
Take it back in time just one day, hey
Hey, hey
[Chorus]
So all I need is a time machine
A one way track
'Cause I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back, taking it back
So all I need (All I need) is a time machine (Is a time machine)
A one way track
'Cause I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back, taking it back
Oh yeah, haha
