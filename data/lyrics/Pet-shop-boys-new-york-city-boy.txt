[Chorus 1]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Verse 1]
When you're a boy
Some days are tough
Lying on your bed
Playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
You gotta escape
Want to go and wander
In the 
ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
Into New York City
[Chorus]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Verse 2]
The street is amazing
The hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
At the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb!
If you don't get the mix
It's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City
[Chorus]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Chorus]
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway[Interlude]
Then as the evening falls
You can return its calls
[Bridge]
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City Boy
So young, so run
Into New York City
[Chorus]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Chorus]
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Interlude]
New York City
New York City[Chorus]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Chorus]
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
[Outro]
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
