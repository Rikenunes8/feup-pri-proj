[Chorus:]
I don't want nobody
To give me nothing
Open up the door
I'll get it myself
[Chorus:] 2X
Do you hear me
[Chorus:]
Don't give me integration
Give me true communication
Don't give me sorrow
I want equal opportunity
To live tomorrow
Give me schools
And give me better books
So I can read about myself
And gain my truer looks
[Chorus:]
Do you hear me now, now
[Chorus:]
Some of us try
As hard as we can
We don't want no sympathy
We just wanna be a man
[Chorus:]
Do you hear me
[Chorus:]
We got talents we can use
On our side of town
Let's get our heads together
And get it up from the ground
When some of us make money
We forget about our peopleGotta grab out a honey
Forget about honey
Do you now, let me hear, hey
Come on, I got to have it
Come on, I need it
I got to have it, come on
I got to have it, ohh
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
Play with your bad self
Come on, baby
Come here now
Gotta get it
Got to get myself together
So many things I've got to do
So many things I've got to do
I don't no help from you
Tell everybody, body else
All of these things, baby
I'll do it myself
Come on, hey
I got to have it
I, said I, said I
Said I, said I, I[Chorus:] 3X
Do you hear me
[Chorus:] 2X

You what to do
I'm not gonna raise a fuss
But before you make another move
Let's start by taking care of us
[Chorus:]
Do you hear me
[Chorus:]
Kids get that education
And don't you take no more
Cause we gonna get
This thing together
You got to carry the bell
I don't want nobody
To give me nothing
Open up the door
Open up the door
Open up the door
Open up the door
Open up the door
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus:]
Can you dig the groove
Can you make the move...
