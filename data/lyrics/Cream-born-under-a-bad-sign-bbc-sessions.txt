Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Bad luck and trouble is my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
More wine and women is all I crave
Big bad women gonna carry me to my grave
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Bad luck and trouble's been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad sign
