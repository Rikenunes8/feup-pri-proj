[Verse 1]
Can you see me, yeah, begging you on my knees?
Whoa yeah!
Can you see me, baby?
Baby, please don't leave
Yeah, if you can see me doing that
You can see in the future of a thousand years
[Verse 2]
Can you hear me? Crying all over town
Yeah, babe
Can you hear me, baby? Crying 'cause you put me down
Must be joking
If you can hear me doing that you can
Hear a freight train coming from a thousand miles
[Guitar solo]
Ah yeah
[Verse 3]
Can you hear me? Singing this song to you
Ah, you better open up your ears
Can you hear me, baby? Singing this song to you
Ah shucks!
If you can hear me sing
You better come home like you're supposed to do
[Outro]
Can you see me?
Hey, hey
I don't believe you can see me
Whoa yeah!
Can you hear me baby?
I don't believe you can
You can't see me
