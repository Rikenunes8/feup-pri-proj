[Chorus]
From our tree swings an apple
A pear or a candle
That once caught captive of your love
Is asked by dear time to sway
Is asked by dear time to sway
[Verse 1]
Never held, the memory unto
Our edifice as serves you
Is singly rhapsody and koan
Where a heart like mine belongs
Where a heart like mine belongs
[Verse 2]
No flower outlives its raindrop
No tower outlives its hilltop
I'm necromancer and your balm
Is it hearth of silent knowledge
From fount of easy bondage
I'm never more than you could want
Where a heart like mine belongs
Where a heart like mine belongs
Yes, where a heart like mine belongs
[Chorus]
From our tree swings an apple
A pear or a candle
That once caught is captive of your love
From our tree swings an apple
A pear or a candle
That once caught is captive of your love
[Outro]
No flower outlives a raindrop
No tower outlives its hilltop
I'm necromancer and your balm
Where a heart like mine belongs
Where a heart like mine belongs
Yes, where a heart like mine belongs
