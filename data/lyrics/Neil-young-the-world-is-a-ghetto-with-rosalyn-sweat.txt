Walkin' down the street
Smoggy-eyed
Looking at the sky (the sky)
Starry-eyed
Searchin' for a place (searchin' for a place, searchin' for a place)
Weary-eyed
Crying in the night (crying in the night)
Teary-eyed
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you (that for me and for you)
The world is a ghetto (oh, oh, oh)
Wonder when I'll find
Paradise
Somewhere there's a home (a home)
Sweet and nice
Wonder if I'll find
Happiness
Never give it up
Now I guess
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true (yeah, hmm)
That for me and for you (that for me and for you, and for you)
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true (hey baby)
That for me (me)
And for you (you)
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know (don't you know)
That it's true (that it's true)
That for me (that for me)
And for you (and for you)
The world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The world is a ghetto
You know there's twenty-four hours in the day
The world is a ghetto
Hey now
The world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto
