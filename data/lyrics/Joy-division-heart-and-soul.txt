[Verse 1]
Instincts that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
A struggle between right and wrong
You take my place in the showdown
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
I'll humbly ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I
[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn
[Verse 2]
An abyss that laughs at creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots
Beyond all this good is the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery turns all good reason
There's no turning back, no last stand
[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn[Verse 3]
Existence, well, what does it matter?
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand
The present is well out of hand
[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn
One will burn, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn
