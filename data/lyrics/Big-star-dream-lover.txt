You're a dream lover
And I'm never gonna let you go
And there's no other
Could look as good as you right now
And you shine like ice
And glare your eyes
Won't those daydreams come true
On Beale Street Green
My wishes visualize
The real, so real
Scene twixt me and you
And I wake up and shiver
A lonely quiver
And I don't know where to look
You're a dream lover
Dream, you're a dream, lover
Play it for me guitarist
