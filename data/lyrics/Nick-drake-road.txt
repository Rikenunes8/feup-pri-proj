[Instrumental]
[Verse]
You can say the sun is shining if you really want to
I can see the moon and it seems so clear
[Chorus]
You can take a road that takes you to the stars now
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
You can take a road that takes you to the stars now
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through
