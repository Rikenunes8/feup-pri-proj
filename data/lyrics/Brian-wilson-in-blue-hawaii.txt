- The Elements: Water -
[Intro]
(Water, water, water, water, ooh)
Is it hot as hell in here or is it me?
It really is a mystery
(Water, water, water, ooh)
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take my misery
I could really use a drop to drink
Somewhere in a placid pool and sink
Feel like I was really in the pink
[Verse 1]
I lose a dream when I don't sleep
I'm slumbering
There's still a promise we must keep
I'm wondering
[Refrain]
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii)
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii, lay beyond the sea)
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii, Hawaii back to me)
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii, Hawaii)
[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use a drop to drink right now (In a waterfall, back there in Hawaii)
Take me to a luau now
 (Wa, wa, ho, wa)
And lay before me holy, holy cow (Wa, wa, ho, wa)
[Bridge]
(Down in blue Hawaii)
So far away from blue Hawaii (Wa, wa, ho, wa)
Aloha nui means goodbye (Hawaii, Hawaii)[Our Prayer (Reprise) / Intro for Good Vibrations]
