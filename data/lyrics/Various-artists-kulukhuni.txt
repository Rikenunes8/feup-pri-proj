Nomalizo
Came from the countryside
Came to the city
The golden city
Where life is tricky
Nomalizo
Came chasing her dream
Where many had walked before
Fallen hopes, faded dreams
Somebody just shut the door (Shut the door in their face)
In the golden city
Where life is tricky, tricky, yeah yeah
Nomalizo mtakwethu bathi kulikhuni kule lizwe
(Nomalizo akuni mvul' aphekhaya)
Nomalizo mtakwethu bathi kulikhuni kule lizwe
(Nomalizo akuni mvul' aphekhaya)
Nomalizo mtakwethu, bathi kuyobuya kulunge
(Bawo kuzawubuye kulunge mtakwethu)

There was a time when this whole life was a village
Happy days, loving eyes, kiss the sun and catch the sky
Walk together, eat together, every man a brother
That was then
So very different from the golden city
Where life is tricky, tricky
