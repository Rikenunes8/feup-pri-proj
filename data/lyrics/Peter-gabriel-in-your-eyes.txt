[Verse 1: Peter Gabriel]
Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass, and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away, I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are
[Pre-Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
All my instincts, they return
The grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside
[Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes,
 
I am complete
In your eyes,
 
I see the doorway
In your eyes,
 
to a thousand churches
In your eyes,
 the resolution
In your eyes,
 of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
In your eyes,
 oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]
Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted, and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired, working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive
[Pre-Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
And all my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside[Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
In your eyes 
your eyes, your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes,
 the light, the heat
In your eyes,
 I am complete
In your eyes,
 I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
In your eyes,
 the resolution
In your eyes,
 of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes
I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
