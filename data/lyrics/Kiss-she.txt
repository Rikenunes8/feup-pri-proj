[Verse 1]
She walks by moonlight
No one really knows
Enchanted starlight
Never going home
[Chorus]
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good
[Verse 2]
Doing well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes
[Chorus]
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good
[Instrumental break 1:52-3:10]
[Verse 3]
Doing well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes
[Outro]
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good
