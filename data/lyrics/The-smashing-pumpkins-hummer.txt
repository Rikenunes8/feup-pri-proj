[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Faith lies in
The ways of sin
I chased the charmed
But I don't want them anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
And in their eyes, I was alive—a fool's disguise
Take me away from you
[Verse 2]
And shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than I’d ever been
[Chorus]
When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew and revive
It's alright, honey, it's alright, yeah
[Bridge 1]
Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel okay?
It scares the disenchanted, far
Away
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge 2]
Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you?
Yeah, I love you
It's true[Bridge 3]
Life's a bummer
When you're a hummer
Life's a drag, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me, I ain't free
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me, I ain't free
Do you feel
Love is real?
[Guitar Solo]
