[Roger Daltry]
Our first gig in England for a very long time... well, it seems like a long time. Actually, it's been about a month and a half, two months. And it's really great to play in England again. This is a—

[Roger Daltry]
We been over with the Germans, you know, 
ooh
, 
ugh

[Keith Moon]
There was food poisoning in the sauerkraut!
[Roger Daltry]
They're very tough, actually. This one is a rock and roll song, done by a guy called Benny Spellman, I'm sure you've never heard of him, but I'm sure you've heard of The Rolling Stones, cos they done it—
[Keith Moon]
The Merseybeats!
[Roger Daltry]
Ooh, yeah, The Merseybeats, they done it!
[Crowd jeering]
[Roger Daltry]
(laughing)
 And Wayne Fontana, he did it! And now we do it, it's one called "Fortune Teller."
[Keith Moon]
And ours is the most important version!
[Verse 1: Roger Daltry, Pete Townshend]
I went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head
Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said, "Sonny, you feel kind of warm"
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said, "You're in love"[Verse 2: Roger Daltry, Pete Townshend]
I said, "It could not be so
Not with all the girls I know"
She said, "When the next one arrives
Take a look into her eyes
[Instrumental break]
[Verse 3: Roger Daltry, Pete Townshend]
I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies
I hurried right back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Said, "I didn't see nobody"
Why'd she made a fool out of me?
At last something shook me
As if it came down from above
While looking at the fortune teller
Now I'm in love
