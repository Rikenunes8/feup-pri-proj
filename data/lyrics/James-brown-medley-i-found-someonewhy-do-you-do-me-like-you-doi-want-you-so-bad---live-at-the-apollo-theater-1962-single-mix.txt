I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I know it's true, I love you
I found someone to love me
Why did it happen this way?
Someone has taken my place
Girl, want to share my embrace
Oh, why do you do me like you do?
You made me love you, but I feel so sad
You made me need you, and it's driving me so mad
Oh, oh, mm, I want you so bad
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I know it's true, I love you
I found someone to love me
