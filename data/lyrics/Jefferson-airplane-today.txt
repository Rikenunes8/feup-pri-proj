[Verse 1]
Today, I feel like pleasing you more than before
Today, I know what I wanna do, but I don’t know what for
To be living for you is all I want to do
To be loving you it’ll all be there when my dreams come true
[Verse 2]
Today you’ll make me say that I somehow have changed
Today you look into my eyes, I’m just not the same
To be any more than all I am would be a lie
I’m so full of love I could burst apart and start to cry
[Verse 3]
Today, everything you want I swear it all will come true
Today, I realize how much I’m in love with you
With you standing here, I could tell the world what it means to love
To go on from here, I can’t use words but it don’t say enough
[Outro]
Please, please listen to me
It’s taken so long to come true
And it’s all for you
All for you
