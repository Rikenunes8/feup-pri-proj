Could be a spoonful of diamonds
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfied my soul
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoon
Could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is good enough for me
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoon
Could be a spoonful of diamonds
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfied my soul
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Those spoonCould be a spoonful of water
Save you from the desert sand
Just a little spoon from your forty five
Save you from another man
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
