[Verse 1]
Prince or pauper, beggar man or thief
Play the game with ev'ry blow you bring
[Chorus]
Dandelion don't tell no lies
Dandelion will make you wise
Tell me if she laughs or cries
Blow away dandelion
[Verse 2]
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four o'clock, five
Dandelions don't care about the time
[Chorus]
Dandelion don't tell no lies
Dandelion will make you wise
Tell me if she laughs or cries
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
[Bridge]
Though you're older now, it's just the same
You can play the dandelion game
When you're finished with your childlike prayers
Well, you know you should wear it
[Verse 3]
Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailors lives
Rich man, poor man, beautiful daughters wives
[Chorus]
Dandelion don't tell no lies
Dandelion will make you wise
Tell me if she laughs or cries
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
[Verse 5]
Little girls and boys come out to play
Yes!
Bring your dandelions to blow away[Chorus]
Dandelion don't tell no lies
Dandelion will make you wise
Tell me if she laughs or cries
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
[Outro]
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
Dandelion
