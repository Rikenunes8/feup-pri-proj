[Verse 1]
Everything is goin' wrong
It's not right anymore
We can't seem to get along
The way we did before
Sun is hangin' in the sky
Sinkin' low and so am I
Just for the love of someone
And a big red sun
[Chorus]
How'm I gonna lose
These big red sun blues?
Big red sun, big red sun
Big red sun blues
[Verse 2]
True love to hold
Is worth everything
It's worth more than gold
Or any diamond ring
But this little diamond
And a heart that's been broken
Are all I got from you
Big red sun
[Chorus]
How'm I gonna lose
These big red sun blues?
Big red sun, big red sun
Big red sun blues
[Verse 3]
Look out at that western sky
Out over the open plains
God only knows why
This is all that remains
But give me one more promise
And another kiss
And I guess the deal's still on
You big red sun[Chorus]
How'm I gonna lose
These big red sun blues?
Big red sun, big red sun
Big red sun blues
How'm I gonna lose
These big red sun blues?
Big red sun, big red sun
Big red sun blues
