[Chorus]
Oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
Oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry
I have everything, little girl, coming my way
[Verse 1]
Well, you wake up in the morning with your face all
All full of frowns
I asked you, "What's wrong with you?"
You say, "I'm slowly putting you down"
[Chorus]
But oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
I won't have to worry
I have everything, little girl, coming my way
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Oh, you leave home in the morning
You won't come back tonight
You won't cook me no food
And you still say you treat me right
[Chorus]
But oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
I won't have to worry
I have everything, little girl, coming my way
