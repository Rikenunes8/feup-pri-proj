[Verse 1]
So kinetic, electric waterloo
In vitro, in shadow Xanadu
Perfumed papers that say that we'll mend
Let's dance around again
Let's dance around again
[Chorus]
Saints, feints
We are fools
Saints, feints
We are fools
But sometimes, fools, they rule
[Verse 2]
Minerva, desert us in pantomime
Pathetic, prophetic columbines
These perfumed vapors that reek a riot's end
Let's dance around again
Let's dance around again
[Chorus]
Saints, feints
We are fools
Saints, feints
We are fools
Saints, saints
Saints
We are fools
But sometimes, fools, they rule
[Bridge]
October loves you
Strawberries love you
Who wouldn't love you?
[Chorus]
Saints
(We are)
Saints
(We are)
Saints, saints
Saints
We are fools
But sometimes, fools, they rule
