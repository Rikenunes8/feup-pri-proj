How many more years
Have I got to let you dog me around?
How many more years
Have I got to let you dog me around?
I'd soon rather be dead
Sleeping six feet in the ground
I'm gonna fall on my knees
I'm gonna raise up my right hand
I'm gonna fall on my knees
I'm gonna raise up my right hand
Say I'd feel much better, darling
If you'd just only understand
I'm going upstairs
I'm gonna bring back down my clothes
I'm going upstairs
I'm gonna bring back down my clothes, do them all
If anybody ask about me
Just tell 'em I walked out on
