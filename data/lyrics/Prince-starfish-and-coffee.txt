[Verse 1]
It was 7:45, we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy
Third in line was me
All of us were ordinary
Compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20
And every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say
[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine
And a side order of ham
And if you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
[Verse 2]
Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes, I wondered
If the mates were in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it
When Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died
You know what we found?
[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam, oh-oh[Verse 3]
(Starfish and coffee)
Cynthia had a happy face
Just like the one she draws
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singing
[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam, oh-oh
[Outro]
(La-la-la)
Oh, ooh (La-la-la)
Oh, ooh (La-la-la)
(Starfish and coffee is love for the soul)
Oh, ooh (La-la-la)
(Starfish and coffee is love for the soul)
La-la-la-la-la
