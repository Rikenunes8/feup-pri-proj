Speed along the highway
Honey, I want it my way
But listen to her daddy's song
"Don't stay out too long"
Ooh, we're just busy hidin'
Sittin' in the back seat of my car

Looking for a ride in the haul-about
Looking for a ride in and out of town
What's wrong with a ride in a haul-about?
Looking for a ride in and out of - oh

Sitting in the back seat of my car(Gibberish)
