[Verse 1]
Sitting here
Wasting my time for you
And I'm not too crazy about the idea
Of having nothing to do, oh no
[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's time for a change
The idea might sound strange, oh
There's no time to waste
[Chorus]
Let's get married today (Let's get married)
Gonna get married (Let's get married)
Married today (Let's get married)
I love you anyway, oh my (Let's get married)
[Verse 2]
There must be something wrong
Or something here
That I don't understand
Oh, you don't believe me
You say you love me
Why don't you give me your hand?
Oh baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you one thing
I'm tired of playing around
A girl in every town
I want to settle down
And stop foolin' around
[Chorus]
(Let's get married)
I've got to stop foolin' around
(Let's get married)
Stop foolin' around
(Let's get married)
You don't believe me but I want to stop
Foolin' around
(Let's get married)
Let me say it[Bridge]
I didn't mean to say all the things I said, oh no
The way I felt in my heart
It came out that way
Let me tell you one thing
Don't want to say anything to drive you away
[Chorus]
Let's get married today (Let's get married)
Hey (If you love me, let's get married)
Alright
Wanna get married (Let's get married)
Let's get married today
[Breakdown]
Might as well
Might as well
'Cause take you in my arms and hold you
Take you in arms and squeeze you
Take you in my arms and love you every night
Just make everything alright, alright
I wanna soothe you baby, want to soothe you baby, want to soothe you baby, want to soothe you baby
I want to love you baby, want to love you baby, want to understand you baby
I'll tell you, will you talk to me?
I'll tell you you can talk to me
Try to understand your lovin' ways
Try to just let me, let me, let me
Soothe you baby, let me soothe you baby, I can soothe you baby, I can, I can wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away
Girl, wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears awayHey hey, hey hey
You can know me
You don't believe me
Ow, ow, ow, ow
Ow, ow, ow, ow
Let's get married today
I found out I didn't, I don't love nobody anyway
I really really love you baby
I really really love you baby
I tell the truth about it
I love you baby
I can feel the groove comin' on now
Hey hey
