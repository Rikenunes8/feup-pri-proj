One, two, checka how we do, ha, ha, ha
One, two (Baby)

[Verse 1]
You're hotter than a summer day in California
You got me melting like a sundae and I want ya
I know you've been waiting
You've been waiting a long time for me (For me)
But if you wait a little while longer
This is how it be
[Chorus]
Oh, it's gonna be hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist (When me and you)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss
[Verse 2]
You shouldn't rush it, take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready if that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you
I won't keep you holding on (Holding on)
But if you wait on me, I promise you it won't be long
[Chorus]
Oh, it's gonna be hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (You won't, no)
You can't resist (Oh no)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss (I'm gonna make it)
Hot like fire (And I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (Don't you want me?)
You can't resist (When me and you)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss (Baby, take your time)
[Bridge]
Take your time, don't move too fast (No, no, no)
Take your time (There's no rushing me, no, no, no)
Take your time (Woah, take your time)
Take your time (I'm gonna make it all good for you, baby)[Chorus]
Hot like fire (I'm gonna take you)
Take you higher (No, no, no, you won't resist)
You can't resist (When I taste your lips)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss
Hot like fire (No, no, no, no, no)
Take you higher (No, no, no, no, no)
You can't resist (No, no, no, no, no)
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss (No, no, no, no, no)
