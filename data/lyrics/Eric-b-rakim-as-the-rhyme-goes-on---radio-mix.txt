The making of a classic
Cold gettin' busy on the tempo
About to get hype
Pumpin' the turbo
Listen to the man on the mic
Cold gettin' busy on the tempo
About to get hype
Pumpin' the turbo
Listen to the man on the mic
The making of a classic
Broadcasting the beat
Twenty million dollars in cash
Paid in full
Little snippets and the little bits of—
Listen to the making—
Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
You sweat as you step, about to get hype
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic
You're physically in this with me, but how could you tell
If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well?
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured
Into the mic, so unite and this won't be so bored
If you just keep kickin', listen to the mix
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
Holds and controls you 'til I leave
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe
The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then
Bring 'em to the front, 'cause my rhyme's the oxygen
Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance, well, let the rhyme continue
And so on, and I'ma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top— Rising— if I stop—
Rising to the top— if I stop—
Rising to the top— stop—
Cold gettin' busy on the tempo
About to get hype
Pumpin' the turbo
Listen to the man on the mic
Give me a mic, if it's loud I'll blow it
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it
Pull out my cordless mic to entertain you well
Before I let go, I'ma spark your brain cells
I took time to write, tonight I will recite
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
Rhymes start flowin', kisses are blowin'
MCs are knowin' that's why they're goin'
Home to tell a friend when the party ends
"Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage
Tape by tape and page by page
When the crowd is moving, I compete with the mix
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets
Deeper and deeper, I hope you understand it
I made it up myself and I planned it
For other MCs who waste time
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme (Pump it up, homeboy)
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking
They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'
To get up on the microphone and then start takin'
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet
Attracted to a freestyle put in effect
You listen to the man while you're sippin' Moet
So Eric, pick up the needle (Yeah), put it in the middle (Alright)
Give me a scratch, turn my mic up a little
I want you to hear this perfectly clear
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea?
I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on
The making of a classic
