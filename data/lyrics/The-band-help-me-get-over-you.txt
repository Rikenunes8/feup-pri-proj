Why you always gotta be so perfect?
Can't you see the way I'm hurting?
You make it look easy
I'm still fillin' up spaces you left
Runnin' in place in my head
Starin' at a turned-off TV
I know this is goodbye
But I was hopin' that you might
Make it easier tonight
Tell me you slept with my best friend
Say you always hated my band
And you wish you'd never met me
Or you met somebody new
Put me out of all my misery
Say you can't stand the thought of me
Even if you have to lie
There must be something you can do
Help me get over you

I wish that I had a single reason
I could hate you for leavin'
Could you just give me somethin'?
Talk shit, get all of my friends on your side
Go off about me online
Call me when you're drunk and

Tell me you slept with my best friend
Say you always hated my band
And you wish you'd never met me
Or you met somebody new
Put me out of all my misery
Say you can't stand the thought of me
Even if you have to lie
There must be something you can do
Help me get over you
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I know you can do no wrong
But maybe I could just move on

If you slept with my best friend
If you just hated my band
If you wished you'd never met me
Can't you meet somebody new?
Put me out of all my misery
Say you can't stand the thought of me
Even if you have to lie (Oh, oh)
Anything's better than the truth (Oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah
There must be something you can do
Just help me get over you
