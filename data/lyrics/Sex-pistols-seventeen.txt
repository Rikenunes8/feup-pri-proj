[Verse 1: Johnny Rotten]
You're only 29
Got a lot to learn
But when your mummy dies
She will not return
[Verse 2: Johnny Rotten]
We like noise, it's our choice
It's what we wanna do
We don't care about long hair
I don't wear flares
[Verse 3: Johnny Rotten]
See my face, not a trace
No reality
I don't work, I just speed
That's all I need
[Outro: Johnny Rotten]
I'm a lazy sod, I'm lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod, I'm so lazy
I'm a lazy sod, I'm lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod, I'm so lazy
I can't even be bothered
Lazy, lazy
