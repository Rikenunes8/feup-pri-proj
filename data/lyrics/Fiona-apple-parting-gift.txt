[Verse 1]
I opened my eyes while you were kissing me once
More than once
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Just as sincere as a dog does
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love
[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you could never tell
That I knew you didn't know me that well
It is my fault you see
You never learned that much from me
[Chorus]
Oh, you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to the last time
The sign said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
It said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
[Verse 2]
I took off my glasses while you were yelling at me once
More than once
So as not to see you see me react
Should've put 'em, should've put 'em on again
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back
[Pre-Chorus]
I bet your fortress face
Belied your fort of lace
It is by the grace of me
You never learned what I could see
[Chorus]
Oh, you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to all the last times
All the signs said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
It said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
