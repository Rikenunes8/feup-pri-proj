You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed
You've changed
Your kisses now are so blasé
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed
You've forgotten the words "I love you"
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared
You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now
You've changed
You've forgotten the words "I love you"
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared
You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now
You've changed
You've changed
