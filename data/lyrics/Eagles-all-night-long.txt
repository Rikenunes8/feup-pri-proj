[Verse 1]
We get up early and we work all day
We put our time in because we like to stay up
[Chorus]
All night long
[Verse 2]
We keep on grinning until the weekend comes
Just a pinch between your cheek and gum
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 3]
Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business and we have some fun
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 4]
We like a long neck and a good old song
Turn it up and then we sing along, sing along
We're all staying up
[Chorus][x5]
