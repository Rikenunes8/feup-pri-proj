[Verse 1]
She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within
[Chorus]
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
[Interlude]
Give it
[Verse 2]
Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
[Chorus]
Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
[Chorus]
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
 (Goddamn it, let me go!)
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
