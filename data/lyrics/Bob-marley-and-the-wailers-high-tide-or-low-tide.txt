[Intro]
In high seas or in low seas
I am going to be your friend
I am going to be your friend
In high tide or in low tide
I will be by your side
I will be by your side
[Verse 1]
(I heard her praying, praying, praying)
I said, I heard my mother
She was praying (Praying, praying, praying)
And the words that she said (The words that she said)
They still linger in my head (Lingers in my head)
She said, "A child is born in this world
He needs protection
God, guide and protect us
When we are wrong, please correct us
(When we are wrong, correct us)
And stand by me." yeah!
[Chorus]
In high seas or in low seas
I am going to be your friend
He said, "I am going to be your friend"
And, baby, in high tide or low tide
I will be by your side
I will be by your side
[Verse 2]
I said I heard my mother
She was crying (I heard her crying), yeah! (Crying, crying)
And the tears that she shed (The tears that she shed)
They still linger in my head (Lingers in my head)
She said: "A child is born in this world
He needs protection
God, guide and protect us
When we are wrong, (When we're wrong), correct us
[Outro]
And in high seas or low seas
I am going to be your friend
I am going to be your friend
Said, high tide or low tide
I will be by your side
I will be by your side
