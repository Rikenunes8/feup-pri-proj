[Verse 1]
The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
And I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
"Let my guitar-playing friend do my request."
[Chorus]
Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
[Verse 2]
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, "There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?"
[Chorus]
Won't you sing me back home with a song I used to hear?
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die
