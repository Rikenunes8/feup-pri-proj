[Chorus]
You're an awful lot of fun
Forever on the run
You're my number one
But if you're not late, then I guess you never come
[Verse 1]
You're always on my side, boy
When it comes to playing games of "Who are we?"
We never find out why though
That our own raison d'etre we can't see
[Chorus]
You're an awful lot of fun
Forever on the run
You're my number one
But if you're not late, then I guess you never come
[Verse 2]
I said blue eyes would suit you
Yes they do, oh, I knew I would be right
But watch your friends don't get you
'cause if they do, I won't be seeing you tonight
