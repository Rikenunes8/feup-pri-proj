[Verse 1]
The Bogus Man is on his way
As fast as he can run
He's tired but he'll get to you
Shoot you with his gun
[Chorus 1]
Focused his mind
On something he cared about
But it came out a shout
Just like before
[Verse 2]
The Bogus Man is at your heels
Now clutching at your coat
You must be quick, now hurry up
He's scratching at your throat
[Chorus 2]
Concealed his doubt
By skillful evasion
But he couldn't find out
About deception
[Verse 3]
The Bogus Man is on his way
As fast as he can run
He's tired but he'll get to you
And show you lots of fun
[Instrumental Outro]
