[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill
It's growing
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel
It's growing
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun
It's growing
Like the tale by the time it's been told by more than one, hoo
It's growing
[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and it grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows
(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows)
How it grows, and it grows, and it grows
(Nobody knows) Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody knows, it grows, it grows, where is it gonna stop)
[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Woo, like a need in a guy to see his girl
When she's gone away, it's growing
Like the sadness in his little heart
When he knows that she's gone to stay, woo, it's growing[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and it grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows
(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows) It gets a little wider
(Nobody knows) Oh, it gets a little stronger
(Hey, hey, hey) The feeling for each kiss, baby
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, it lasts a little longer, yeah
(Hey, hey, hey) Ooh, so much... ooh, so much
Can't you see it's growing, baby?
It grows, and it grows, and it grows, and it grows
