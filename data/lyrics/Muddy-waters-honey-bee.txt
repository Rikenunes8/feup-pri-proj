[Chorus]
Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on[x2]
[Bridge]
You going to keep on sailing till you lose your happy home
[Chorus]
[Verse 1]
I don't mind you sailing, but please don't sail so long
All right little honey bee
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little honey bee[x2]
She been all around the world making honey
But now she is coming back home to me
