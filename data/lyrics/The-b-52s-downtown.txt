Bring all the lights low, I know a place to go
Yeah, I know a place to go
Downtown
(Downtown!)
When you are lonely, life is makin' you grumpy
You can always go (Downtown!)
Just listen to the music and the traffic of the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
(Downtown!)
I know a place to go when it is so slow (Downtown)
(I want some tea!)
I know a place to go when you get so old (Wanna beer!)
I know a place to go when you want dress up and love
(Downtown, downtown!)
Yeah, listen!
Oo, listen!
Yeah, listen!
(Downtown!)
When you're working!
(Downtown!)
When you're talking!
(Downtown!)
When you get your lover's notes!
(Downtown!)
Think of the people
Yeah, think of the people
Oh, maybe I'll see you there
If I can do my hair (Downtown!)
Where you see the people go in free (Downtown!)
Where you see the people go downtown
Let's all go
I said, why don't we show ourselves?
Downtown! (Downtown!)
Oo, Downtown! (Downtown!)
Where all the lights are low!
