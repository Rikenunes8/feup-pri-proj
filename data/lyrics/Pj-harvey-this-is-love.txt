[Verse 1]
I can't believe life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress
I can't believe life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress
[Chorus]
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love that I'm feeling
[Verse 2]
Does it have to be a life full of dread?
Wanna chase you 'round the table, wanna touch your head
Does it have to be a life full of dread?
Wanna chase you 'round the table, wanna touch your head
[Chorus]
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love that I'm feeling
[Verse 3]
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering
When you taste so good
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering
When my headache burns
[Chorus]
That love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love that I'm feeling
[Post-Chorus]
Even in the summer, even in the spring
Can never get too much of a wonderful thing[Bridge]
You're the only story that I never told
You're my dirty little secret, want to keep you so
You're the only story that never been told
You're my dirty little secret, want to keep you so
Come on out, come on over, help me forget
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in
Come on out, come on over, help me forget
Keep the walls from falling on me, tumbling in
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in
[Chorus]
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
