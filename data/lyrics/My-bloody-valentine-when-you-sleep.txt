[Verse 1: Kevin Shields]
When I look at you
Oh, but I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
When you walk away
[Verse 2: Kevin Shields]
When you say "I do"
Oh, but I don't believe in you
I can't forget it, ooh
When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile
And you turn your long blonde hair
[Verse 3: Kevin Shields]
When I look at you
Oh, but I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
When you walk away
