[Verse 1]
I wouldn't know what to do with another chance
If you gave it to me
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance
It'd race right through me
[Refrain]
I'm much better off the way things are
Much much better off, better by far, by far
[Verse 2]
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice
It'd roll right past me
And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice
So don't even ask me
[Refrain]
I'm much better off, the way things are
Much much better off, better by far, by far
[Chorus]
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle
I bet I'll be able to move on
[Bridge]
How can I fight, when we're on the same side?
How can I fight beside you?
[Chorus]
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle
I bet I'll be able to move on
[Chorus]
Keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle
I bet I'll be able to move on
