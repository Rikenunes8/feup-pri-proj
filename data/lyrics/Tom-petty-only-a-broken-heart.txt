[Verse 1]
Here comes that feeling
I've seen in your eyes
Back in the old days
Before the hard times
[Chorus 1]
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart
[Verse 2]
I know the place where
You keep your secrets
Out of the sunshine
Down in a valley
[Chorus 1]
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart
[Bridge]
What would I give
To start all over again?
To clean up my mistakes?
[Verse 3]
Stand in the moonlight
Stand under heaven
Wait for an answer
Hold out forever[Chorus 2]
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart
[Bridge]
What would I give
To start all over again?
To clean up my mistakes?
[Verse 4]
I know your weakness
You've seen my dark side
The end of the rainbow
Is always a long ride
[Chorus 2]
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart
It's only a broken heart
