[Verse 1]
Sea of sin
I'm swimming in
And I'm taking a dive
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it keeps me alive
It gets better and better
As it gets wetter and wetter
[Chorus]
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
But I don't care
[Verse 2]
Sea of sin
Through thick and thin
For better or worse
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper
As we sink deeper and deeper
[Chorus]
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there
[Bridge]
Here under God's sky
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize
[Verse 3]
Sea of sin
My second skin
My home from home
When I'm in doubt
My hands reach out
And I'm never alone
It gets wetter and wetter
As it gets better and better[Chorus]
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I'm prepared
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
Yes I'm aware
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I don't care
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I don't care
