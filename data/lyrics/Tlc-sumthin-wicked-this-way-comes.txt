[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Remember back in the time
When the only sign we had was pickets
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked
G-angs killin' others for colors
Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason to be blastin'
What the kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but
Had enough of singin' that same song
See, I stayed across the street from the projects
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk
To keep my pockets (Come on)
Fat, like cellulite
 only been to jail one week
For some shull-bit and I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to
No, I shouldn't a did that, cause if I did that
Y'all would not hear dat phat shit
That keeps you on your tippy-tippy-toes
Like that sellout, not callin' no names
But really, "who's bad"
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from
[T-Boz]
Take a good look in the mirror
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil
But you're always quick to point the finger at me
Won't somebody tell me[Chorus]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all
[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me
[Chorus]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday[Verse 3: Left Eye]
A-yo, if we could all agree
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And this stress on my back
With them gats they be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap (Yeah)
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's cause I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising 
the arisin' of the moon
As it roams around into my soundproof dimension
[Chorus (T-Boz)]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday (Oh yeah)I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for (Hey)
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday
