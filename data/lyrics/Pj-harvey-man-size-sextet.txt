[Verse 1]
I'm coming up man-sized
Skinned alive
I want to fit
Mmm, got to get
Man-sized
I'm heading on
Handsome
Got my leather boots on
[Chorus 1]
Got my girl and she's a wow
I cast my iron knickers down
I'm man-size, no need to shout
Can you hear, can you hear me now?
[Chorus 2]
I'm man-sized
Man-sized
[Verse 2]
I'll measure time
I'll measure height
I'll calculate
My birthrite
Good Lord, I'm big
I'm heading on
Man-sized
Got my leather boots on
[Chorus 1]
Got my girl and she's a wow
I cast my iron knickers down
I'm man-size, no need to shout
Can you hear, can you hear me now?
[Verse 3]
My babe looking cool and neat
I'm pretty sure good enough to eat
I'm man-size, no need to shout
Let it all, let it all hang out[Chorus 2]
I'm man-size
Man-size
Man-size
Man-size
Man-size
Man-size
Man-size
Man-size
[Outro]
Silence my lady head
Get girl out of my head
Douse hair with gasoline
Set it light and set it free
