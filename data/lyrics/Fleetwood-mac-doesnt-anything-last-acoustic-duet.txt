[Verse 1]
The last time I saw her
She didn’t have anything to say, that hurt
Time has a funny way of turning things around
Doesn’t anything last?
[Verse 2]
Not so long ago that you loved me
She tried but she couldn’t understand, oh, no
Time has a funny way of turning down a man
Doesn’t anything last?
