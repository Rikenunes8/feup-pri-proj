Me to you to me
Thunderbolts caught easily
Shouting truth peacefully
Electricity
(turn it up)
High voltage man kids his night to bring the light to those who need-
To hide their shadow deep
Though it's too bright find the light I know that friends don't mind-
Just how you glow
Midnight cowboys steers in black hit the dark road without a map to free
Seek electricity seek electricity
Midnight cowboys steers in black hit the dark road without a map to free
Seek electricity seek electricity
Lighthouse beacon straight ahead straight ahead across black sea to bring
Seeking electricity
High voltage man kids his night to bring the light to those who need-
To hide their shadow deep
You are a shallow deed
High voltage man kids his night to bring the light to those who need-
To hide their insanity
You are insanity
Seek electricity seek electricity seek electricity seek electricity-
Seek electricity seek electricity seek electricity
Seek electricity seek electricity
Electricity
