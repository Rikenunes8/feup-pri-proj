[Verse 1]
I always said you could make it
I know what I said and I meant it
I always liked the way you played guitar
I always knew that someday you'd go far
And if you do, will anything happen?
Will it come true, will anything happen?
Will I see you again?
[Verse 2]
You said you'd be through here again
Please don't forget I'm here waiting
You always said that you would never change
Like the people that you've met and the places that you've been
And if you do, will anything happen?
Will it come true, will anything happen?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
[Verse 3]
I always said you could make it
Just don't forget that I said it
Cause I always liked the way you played guitar
And I always knew that someday you'd go far
And if you do, will anything happen?
Will it come true, will anything happen?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
[Outro]
And if I do, will anything happen?
