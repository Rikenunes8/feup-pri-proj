No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

Say, say, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Ob-observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say, and…
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
Here, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

Said, said, said, I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights, as it was
Log wood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
So, woman, no cry
No, no, woman, woman no cry
Woman, little sister don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry


I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
As it was log wood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I’m gone

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
Woman, little darlin', say, don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry, eh

(little darlin’, don’t shed no tears)
(no, woman, no cry)
(little sister, don’t shed no tears)
(no, woman, no cry)
