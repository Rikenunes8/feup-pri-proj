[Verse 1]
A world become one of salads and sun
Only a fool would say that
A boy with a plan, a natural man
Wearing a white Stetson hat
[Pre-Chorus]
Unhand that gun begone
There's no one to fire upon
If he's holding it high
He's telling a lie
[Chorus]
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
[Verse 2]
The man in the street dragging his feet
Don't wanna hear the bad news
Imagine your face there at his place
Standing inside his brown shoes
[Pre-Chorus]
You do his nine to five
Drag yourself home half alive
And there on the screen
A man with a dream
[Chorus]
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
[Bridge]
Anybody on the street
Has murder in his eyes
You feel no pain
And you're younger than you realize
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool[Chorus]
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
[Outro]
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
