[Verse 1]
If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man
You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is
[Chorus]
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades
[Verse 2]
Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit, double stake or split
[Chorus]
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades
[Bridge]
You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools
But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't wanna live forever
And don't forget the joker!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Pushing up the ante
, 
I know you got to see me
Read 'em and weep,
 
the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be
[Chorus]
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades
