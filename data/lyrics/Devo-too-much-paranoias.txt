[Verse 1]
Think I got your dial tone
Think I got Billy Baxter's bone
Think I got a bubble-sac
I think I got a Big Mac attack
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce
Special orders, don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
Serve it your way
[Chorus]
There's too much paranoias
There's too much paranoias
My momma's afraid to tell me
The things she's afraid of
[Verse 2]
I been dipped in double meaning
I been stuck with static cling
Think I got a rupto-pac
I think I got a Big Mac attack
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce
Special orders, don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
Serve it your way
[Chorus]
There's too much paranoias
There's too much paranoias
My momma's afraid to tell me
The things she's afraid of
