[Intro]
Hey
[Verse 1]
There's something you must know
I'm so misunderstood
I am a special girl
Livin' in my special world
You know you can't change me
Really gotta see me for me, boy
I'm doin' the best I can
Try to understand
[Chorus]
Accept me for who I am
No woman can take my place, baby
I'm doin' the best I can
So please don't give up on me
Accept me for who I am
Just try and understand
'Cause that's the way it is, babe
[Verse 2]
You are my soul, unique
My dream that's come to me
You know I can't change you
Then again, I don't want to
You seem to understand
When I say I need a lovin' hand
My dream who only loves me for me
[Chorus]
Accept me for who I am
No woman can take my place, baby
I'm doin' the best I can
So please don't give up on me
Accept me for who I am
Just try and understand
'Cause that's the way it is, babe
Accept me for who I am
No woman can take my place, baby
I'm doin' the best I can
So please don't give up on me
Accept me for who I am
Just try and understand
'Cause that's the way it is, babe[Bridge]
I try to make you see
Just what you do to me
I go crazy when I hear your voice or see your smile
Oh, you don't know what you do to me
You make me wanna never have another
Is it enough?
Accept me for (Yeah, mmm)
Accept me for (Yeah, yeah)
Accept me for
[Chorus]
I accept me for who I am
No woman can take my place, baby
I'm doin' the best I can
So please don't give up on me
Accept me for who I am
Just try and understand
'Cause that's the way it is, babe
Accept me for who I am
But nobody can take my place, baby
I'm doin' the best I can
So please don't give up on me
Accept me for who I am
Just try and understand
'Cause that's the way it is, baby
Accept me for who I am
No woman can take my place, baby
I'm doin' the best I can
So please don't give up on me
Accept me for who I am
Just try and understand
'Cause that's the way it is, babe
