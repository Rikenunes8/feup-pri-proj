[Verse 1]
To make you laugh, I would be a fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
I really don't care
I would give my everything to keep you, boy
It breaks my heart when you're not there
I'll stage a ballet on a tabletop
Command performance finger size
And although I ain't got no tune
My show ain't gonna fly
I will find the music there in your eyes
[Chorus]
Oh me, oh my, I'm a fool for you, baby (Baby, now)
Oh me oh my (Fool for you, I)
I am crazy, baby (Crazy, baby)
Oh me, oh my (Me oh my)
Yeah, I'm a fool for you, baby
Come on, let your love light shine on me (Shine on me)
[Verse 2]
We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
And then we'll take a magic carpet ride
Yes we will
And we'll tell our smoky friend, hey, don't you forget
Because you've got to keep us side by side, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh me, oh my (Me oh my)
I am a fool for you, baby (Be your)
Oh me, oh my (Fool for you, I)
You know that I am crazy (Crazy) baby, yes you do (Crazy, baby)
Oh me, oh my (Me oh my)
Oh, I'm a fool for you, baby (Fool, need your)
Come on, let your love light shine on me (Shine)
Would you do that? (On me)
Come on, let your love light shine
Just a little bit right on me (Shine on me)[Outro]
Oh, lover let your love light
Shine on me (Shine on me)
Oh, hear me now
Oh me, me oh my
I'm a fool, oh, for you, baby (Fool now)
Oh, me oh my (I)
You know that I'm crazy, baby (Crazy, baby)
Oh me, oh my
