[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
[Outro]
Sometimes you get so lonely
