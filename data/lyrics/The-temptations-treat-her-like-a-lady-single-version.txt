Treat her like a lady
Hoo
Ooh, yeah, baby
Whoa, mmm
Now I'm the kinda guy who don't believe
That chivalry is dead, no
Cause I believe a woman should be treated
With the utmost respect, mmm
Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away
I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame
Just come and look me over
(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, woah hoo
(More, more, more)
Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up her hanky off the floor
(Yeah, yeah)
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even
(Help her with her coat)
Well, treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
In this world of liberation
It's so easy to forget, mmm
That it's so nice to have a man around
To lend a helping hand, you can bet, bet you can, baby
When I was young, my mama used to say, "Boy
A woman's like a flower with love on her you shower"
Ever since that day, her words never went away
I always will remember to treat my baby tender
(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa
(More, more, more)
Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up her hanky off the floor
(Yeah, yeah)
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
She's a bad son-of-a-gun
I'm her lovin' Don Juan
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
Hoo, whoa
Whoa, baby
Every day, ever way
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa
(More, more, more)
Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up her hanky off the floor
(Yeah, yeah)
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes, even
(Help her with her coat)
Help her out
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
Compliment her on her hair
Even help her with her chair
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like lady)
Now boy, you should remember
To be a gentleman
Treat her like a lady, hoo
(You better)
Treat her like
(Well)
Treat her like
(Ho)
Treat her like a lady
(Treat her like a lady)
