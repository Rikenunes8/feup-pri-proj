Maybe someone's going to save me
My heart is made of gravy
And the laps I swim from lunatics don't count
Open up your stockings
Pull out all the things you never wanted from room service calls
Room service calls

Open up your hands and let me see the things you keep in there
I don't want to split up fifty/fifty
That's the way we do it in this rose town
I've got all the glory in the world
I hope it doesn't floor you before you go
Room service calls in the random falls
Go!
Whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever
Whenever I feel fine
I'm going to walk away from all this, all that
Groovy groovy kitty, you little little pity
With your slip shag watching back
You skinny skinny people don't like that when you con them
Spell me

Spritzer on ice in New York City
Isn't it a pity
You never had anything to mix with that?
Listen to the tender
Behind the open chest in the hall
Room service calls
I'm blue green and cream and blue

Whenever, whenever, whenever
Whenever I feel fine
I walk the plank for you
I walk the plank, I walk the plank for you
In the dark of the capi-federal
Jacob! Jacob Javits, I'd like to thank you for everything
Primarily your glass house
Levi Guess, Levis
Distorted ghosts
One, two, three, go!

Whoa!
Distorted ghosts
