I don't want nobody
If i can't have you
Oh i can't love nobody
Unless i'm loving you
[Chorus]
The way you hug me
The way you squeeze me
The way you kiss me
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
If i can't have you
I can't talk to nobody
Unless i'm talking to you
I don't wanna hold nobody
Unless i'm holding you
[Chorus]
The way you hug me
The way you squeeze me
The way you kiss me
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
If i can't have you
I can't be kissing nobody
Unless i'm kissing you
I just don't i just don't i just don't want to be bothered with nobody
Unless i'm bothered with you
[Chorus]
The way you hug me
The way you squeeze me
The way you kiss me
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
If i can't have you
