[Verse 1]
On a rooftop in Brooklyn
At one in the morning
Watching the lights flash
In Manhattan
I see five bridges
The Empire State Building
And you said something
That I've never forgotten
[Verse 2]
We lean against railings
Describing the colours
And the smells of our homelands
Acting like lovers
How did we get here?
To this point in living?
I held my breath
And you said something
[Verse 3]
And I am doing nothing wrong
Riding in your car
Your radio playing
We sing up to the eighth floor
A rooftop, Manhattan
One in the morning
When you said something
That I've never forgotten
[Outro]
You said something
You said something
You said something
That was really important
