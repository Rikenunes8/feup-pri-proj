[Verse 1: Elvis Presley]
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why?
Oh why, oh why can't my dream come true?
Oh why?
[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood & 
Shawn Mendes
]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?
[Verse 3: Post Malone & 
Darius Rucker
]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain (Oh yeah)
As long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
[Verse 4: Elvis Presley & 
Blake Shelton
]
Deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
Still I am sure that the answer
Answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark
There's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream
Oh, please let my dream come true
Right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah
[Outro: Elvis Presley]
Thank you, good night
