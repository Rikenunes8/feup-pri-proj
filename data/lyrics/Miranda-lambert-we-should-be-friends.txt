[Verse 1]
If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white T-shirts have stains
If you've got some goods and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends
[Verse 2]
If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and mama's and Miller Lites
Well then, we should be friends
[Chorus]
I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains
[Verse 3]
If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends
Come on
[Chorus]
I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains
One, two, three
[Verse 4]
If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get
Well then, oh, we should be friends
Alright[Outro]
Well then, oh, we should be friends
Well then, oh, we can be friends
