Little boy got the notion, get some love tonight
Get yo rap in motion, for she out o' sight
Little girl at the party
Maybe she'd like to dance
Ring around the rosie

Pocket full of chance
Horns, do it

They say that there's nothing's better
Than sleeping on a rainy day
We could spend the night together
Come on baby what you say?

Everybody get way down, tonight we're going to ball
Tonight we're going to get the bomb, y'all
I'm talking 'bout the Detroit crawl
Everybody in the west, everybody in the east
Paint the man a picture with my chicken grease
Get with it
(One more)
Are you ready Paris? Soul Clap!
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Give me the bass, give me the bass, one time
[Verse 4: Sheila E. and 
Prince
]
Said the table to the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair
Can't nobody
Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able!
Fuck with us
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!"
Can't nobody
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try
Fuck with us
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?"
Say, can't nobody
So they both went slowly down
Fuck with us
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
Can't nobody
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side
Fuck with us
"See the table and the chair
Have come to take the air!"
Y'all... say it y'all
But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
'Til to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house
When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother!
Can't nobody fuck with us
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little brawny-
Say it, y'all
Mousey and the beetle dined
And danced upon the heads
'Til they toddled to their beds
Can't nobody fuck with us
Good God
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
[Interlude: Prince]
Revolution, baby way down low
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Say what a beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Come on
(Oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it
(Oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it louder, y'all
(Oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it louder, y'all
(Oh-we-oh-ooh)
Miko, Miko, hit me in the back with funk
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: Prince]
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Everbody feeling alright, y'all say it
Going to be a beautiful night, y'all say it
Everybody, (oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it
(Oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it
(Oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
(Oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
Get the horns in here
Keep singing y'all
Everybody clap your hands
Everybody clap your hands
Everbody, groove, come on
Confusion!
Yeah!
