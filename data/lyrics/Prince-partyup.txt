[Verse 1]
We don't give a damn
We just want to jam, party up
Party up, got to party up
That army bag
Such a double drag, party up
Party up, got to, got to, got to party up
Party, got to party down, baby
Revolutionary rock and roll
Going uptown, baby, ooh
How you going to make me kill somebody
I don't even know?
They got the draft, uh uh
I just laugh
Party up
Party up, got to party up
Fighting war
Is such a fucking bore
Party up
Party up, got to, got to, got to party up
Party, uh uh, got to party down, babe
Ooh, it's all about what's in your mind
Going uptown, baby, ooh
I don't want to die
I just want to have a bloody good time
[Chorus]
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
[Verse 2]
Because of their half-baked mistakes
We get ice cream, no cake
All lies, no truth
Is it fair to kill the youth?
[Chorus]
Party up, oh
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, baby, ooh
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, baby, ooh
Got to party up, yeah (Ooh, ooh)
Got to party up, baby, ooh
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, baby, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Party up, got to party up (Got to party up, baby, ooh)
Party up, got to party up (Got to party up, yeah)
Party up, got to party up (Got to party up, baby, ooh)
Party up, got to party up (Got to party)
Party up, got to party up (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party up, got to party up (Oh yeah)
Party up, got to party up (Got to party up, baby, ooh yeah)
Party up, got to party up[Bridge]
Revolutionary rock and roll
[Chorus]
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up, baby
Party up, got to party up, yeah
Party up, got to party up
[Outro]
You're going to have to fight your own damn war
(Party up, got to party up, yeah)
'Cause we don't want to fight no more

You're going to have to fight your own damn war

'Cause we don't want to fight no more
(Party up, got to party up, yeah)
You're going to have to fight your own damn war

(You're going to have to fight your own damn war
Party up, got to party up, yeah)
'Cause we don't want to fight no more
