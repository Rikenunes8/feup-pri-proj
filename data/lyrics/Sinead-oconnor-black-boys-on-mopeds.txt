[Verse 1]
Margaret Thatcher on TV
Shocked by the deaths that took place in Beijing
It seems strange that she should be offended
The same orders are given by her
[Verse 2]
I've said this before now
You said I was childish and you'll say it now
Remember what I told you:
If they hated me they will hate you
[Chorus]
England's not the mythical land of 
Madame George
 
and roses
It's the home of 
police who kill black boys on mopeds
And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving
I don't want him to be aware that there's
Any such thing as grieving
[Verse 3]
Young mother down at 
Smithfield
5 am, looking for food for her kids
In her arms she holds three cold babies
And the first word that they learned was "please"
[Verse 4]
These are dangerous days
To say what you feel is to dig your own grave
Remember what I told you:
If you were of the world they would love you
[Chorus]
England's not the mythical land of 
Madame George
 and roses
It's the home of police who kill blacks boys on mopeds
And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving
I don't want him to be aware that there's
Any such thing as grieving
