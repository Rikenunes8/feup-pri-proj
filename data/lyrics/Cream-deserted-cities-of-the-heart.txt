Upon this street where time has died
The golden treat you never tried
In times of old, in days gone by
If I could catch your dancing eye
It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah
The street is cold, its trees are gone
The story's told, the dark has won
Once we set sail to catch a star
We had to fail, it was too far
It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams
I felt the wind shout like a drum
You said, "My friend, love's end has come"
It couldn't last, had to stop
You drained it all to the last drop
It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah
On this dark street, the sun is black
The winter life is coming back
On this dark street, it's cold inside
There's no retreat from time that's died
It was on the way
On the road to dreams
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love
