[Verse 1]
I hear people talking bad
About the way they have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things ought to be
And I don't mind them switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
But when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me
[Chorus]
They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me
[Verse 2]
I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims that he just don't believe in fighting
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
And when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me[Chorus]
They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, man
You're walking on the fighting side of me
[Outro]
You're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me
