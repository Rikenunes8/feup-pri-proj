[Verse 1: Mike Love, 
Al Jardine
]
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive?
[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
[Verse 2: Mike Love, 
Al Jardine
]
They come on like they're peaceful but inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better?
[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
[Pre-Chorus 2: Al Jardine]
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better?
[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
