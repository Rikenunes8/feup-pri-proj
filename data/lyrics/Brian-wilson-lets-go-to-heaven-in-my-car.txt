So many times I've had that helpless feeling
But no one or any kind of medicine worked at all
It seems to me that I seem to be overheating
A midnight ride with you might cure it all
Let's go to heaven in my car
I wanna drive you there tonight
Let's go to heaven in my car
We won't be stopping for red lights
Huggin' the kerbs and I'm out of control
Going eye to eye with the radio
Let's go to heaven in my car
I only know, it's time for body contact
I'll never be satisfied touching you with my eyes
There ain't no doubt I can't go without your loving
So, come on baby, let me take you for a ride
Let's go to heaven in my car
I wanna drive you there tonight
Let's go to heaven in my car
We won't be stopping for red lights
Huggin' the kerbs and I'm out of control
Going eye to eye with the radio
Let's go to heaven in my carNow, heaven is a place where lovers go
We've got all night to get there
So, let's take it nice and slow
Let's go to heaven in my car
I wanna drive you there tonight
Let's go to heaven in my car
We won't be stopping for red lights
Let's go to heaven in my car
I wanna drive you there tonight
Let's go to heaven in my car
We won't be stopping for red lights
Let's go to heaven in my car
I wanna drive you there tonight
