[Verse 1]
It's been such a long week
So much crying
I no longer see a future
I've been told when I get older
That I'll understand it all
But I'm not sure if I want to
[Verse 2]
Running into her arms
At the school gates
She whispers that I'm a poor kid
And Granny takes me on her knee
She tells me I'm too sensitive
She makes me sad
She makes me feel like an old man
She makes me feel like an old man
[Chorus]
They took the game right out of it
They took the game right out of it
When I am a man
I will be an astronaut
And find Peter Pan
[Post-Chorus]
Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
[Verse 3]
Dennis loves to look
In the mirror
He tells me that he is beautiful
So I look too, and what do I see?
My eyes are full
But my face is empty
[Verse 4]
He's got a photo
Of his hero
He keeps it under his pillow
But I've got a pin-up
From a newspaper
Of Peter Pan
I found it in a locket
I hide it in my pocket[Chorus]
They took the game right out of it
They took the game right out of it
When I am a man
I will be an astronaut
And find Peter Pan
[Post-Chorus]
Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
Second star on the right
Straight on 'til morning
[Outro]
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
