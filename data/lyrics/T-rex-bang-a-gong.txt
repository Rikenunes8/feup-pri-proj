[Verse 1]
Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl
[Chorus]
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
[Verse 2]
Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
Well you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl
[Chorus]
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
[Verse 3]
Well you're windy and wild
You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl
[Chorus]
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
[Verse 4]
Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you dance when you walk
So let's dance, take a chance, understand me
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl[Outro / Chorus]
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
 (ow)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
 (ow - get it on - mh)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
 (a-a-a-a)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Take me, for a meanwhile I'm still thinking
