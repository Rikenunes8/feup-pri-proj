[Verse 1]
Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, He is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross
[Verse 2]
Ghettos to the left of us
Flowers to the right
There'll be bread for all of us
If we can just bear the cross
[Verse 3]
Sweet song of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all that she brings
[Verse 4]
We all have our problems
Some big, some are small
Soon all of our problems
Will be taken by the cross
[Verse 5]
Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry for He's coming
Don't die without knowing the cross
[Verse 6]
Ghettos to the left of us
Flowers to the right
There'll be bread for all, y'all
If we can just, just bear the cross, yeah
[Verse 7]
We all have our problems
Some are big, some are small
Soon all of our problems, y'all
Will be taken by the cross[Outro]
The cross
The cross
