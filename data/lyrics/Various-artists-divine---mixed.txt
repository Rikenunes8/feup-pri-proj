Hit-boy
Ha!
Talk to me nice!
Gully gang, boy
We back
Bham, bham, bham, bham

Nobody standing on us
Son we’re like quicksand
Nobody can match me
I’m way too lit fam
Two aps in my hand
I call them wristbands
Crew’s all about mischief
We kick it like shin-chan
Big man gets cheques from the rich, yes!
Gutter flow, we really hood, it’s all blessed
We set trends
Y’all just wanna impress
Bros who only fuck with each other, incest
59, on broken glass is where you stand
Angels and the devil are always on-hand
Tattoos on my body, pain in this filled glass
Primo weed and hash, both mixed in this
Stash
Don’t ask how many artists here
It’s how many crooks
On a break from bollywood
Hip-hop’s got em all shook
Can spеak with class
Then outta nowhere hе’s street
Petty arguments?
Just keep that noise
Away from me
Rider rider
Wheelies getting popped
The chillum is ready
Time to light it up
Boys from the south
Gold chains upon us
Even if we were saints
They’d call us sinners
Rider rider
Wheelies getting popped
The chillum is ready
Time to light it up
Boys from the south
Gold chains upon us
Even if we were saints
They’d call us sinners

My star sign (libra) says
I always stay balanced
Trophies in my cups
There’s no royal challenge
Dark, raw shit
This ain’t no colourful palette
Sit in the market
On my plate there ain’t no salad
Relishing the beat
Delicious is my flow
The bread-man says
Cuz i’m good at flippin dough
Everyone famous online
Why am i busy doing shows
Without no rolling pin
I can still make my ‘goal’ (circle)
No diamonds in coal
But in diamonds i’m the coal
For breakfast i got idlis
And chillums in kasol
I eat on the ground
It’s the only time i fold
Chill on the sea-link
It’s the only time i told (tolled)
This ain’t no drizzle
It’s a thunderous storm
This ain’t no conversation
It’s me dropping bombs
The dudes who slept on rugs
Are now dropping rocks
Naked as we come
Keep your contacts in your pocket
My mother is my manager
My dreams (armaan) are so huge
If you can’t keep your word
Your tongue’s of no use
The phone only rings
When they need shit from you
If there was no divine
There wouldn’t be these selfish dudes
I see exactly who’s here
The jealous people all come
We bringing these tsunamis
The flow is konkan
These brakes are never hit
We drive on wrong-turns
Married to the game
But it’s with money that we cheat on it

Wheelies getting popped
The chillum is ready
Time to light it up
Boys from the south
Gold chains upon us
Even if we were saints
They’d call us sinners
Rider rider
Wheelies getting popped
The chillum is ready
Time to light it up
Boys from the south
Gold chains upon us
Even if we were saints
They’d call us sinners
