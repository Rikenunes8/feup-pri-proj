[Verse 1]
Is it too much to ask?
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff
[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this and
[Chorus]
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Whoa)
Passionate kisses from you?
[Verse 2]
Is it much to demand?
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think
[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this and
[Chorus]
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Whoa)
Passionate kisses from you?
[Verse 3]
Do I want too much?
Am I going overboard to want that touch?
I'll shout it out to the night
"Give me what I deserve 'cause it's my right"[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this and
[Chorus]
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Whoa)
Passionate kisses from you?
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Whoa)
Passionate kisses from you
