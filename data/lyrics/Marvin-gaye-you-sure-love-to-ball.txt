[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Ooh baby, please turn yourself around
Ahh baby, so I can love you
Ohh baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh sugar, just like you want me to
[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
[Verse 2]
Oh honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Ooh baby baby, don't ever go away
Oh, stay with me baby, I'll love you night and day
[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
[Verse 3]
Ohh now, I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts (Ohh baby)
That you're my foxy lady, foxy lady[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
[Verse 4]
My lady my baby sure does love to ball
(On my mind there's[?])
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got to get ready
[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
