[Verse 1]
I have walked this earth
And watched people
It doesn't scare me at all
I can be sincere
And say I like them
It doesn't scare me at all
[Refrain]
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all
[Chorus]
I want to go on a mountain top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering
It doesn't scare me at all
[Verse 2]
I'm no fucking buddhist
But this is enlightenment
The less room you give me
The more space I've got
It doesn't scare me at all
[Refrain]
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all
[Chorus]
I want to be on a mountain top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering
It doesn't scare me at all[Verse 3]
This is an alarm-call
So wake up, wake up now
(Beep-Beep-Be-Beep-Beep-Be-Beep-Be-Be-Be-Be-Beep)
Today has never happened
And it doesn't frighten me
It doesn't scare me at all
[Refrain]
You can't say no to hope
You can't say no to happiness
