I lost someone, my love
Someone who's greater than the stars above
Someone, who I need
Someone who don't let my heart bleed
Someone, that's the one
That's the someone
That's the someone that I lost
Don't go to strangers
Come on home to me
I'll love you tomorrow
I'll love you today
Help me, help me
I'm so weak
Gee whiz, I love you
I'm so weak
I'll love you tomorrow
I, I lost someone
A million to one
Ten thousand people
Under my Father's sun
We need someone
Someone, the only one
That someone who needs someone
Under the sun
To care for, care for
Just that someone
I'll love you tomorrow
Like I love you today
I'm so weak
Don't, don't take my heart away
Come on, come on
Gee whiz, I love you
And don't go to strangers
Come on home to me, come on home to me
I'm so weak, I'm so weak
