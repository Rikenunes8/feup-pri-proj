[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of 
fools
[Verse 1]
For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out, love
I'm just a link in your chain
You got me where you want me
I ain't nothing but your fool
You treated me mean
Oh, you treated me cruel
[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools
[Verse 2]
Every chain
Has got a weak link
I might be weak, yeah
But I'll give you strength, oh, hey
You told me to leave you alone
My father said, "come on home"
My doctor said, "take it easy"
Oh, but your loving is much too strong[Chorus]
I'm added to your chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Your chain of fools
[Verse 3]
One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until the day
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh hey
[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Your chain of fools, oh
[Outro]
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain) Oh
Chain, chain, chain
Your chain of fools, oh yeah
