Oh, yeah
Alright

Somebody's Heine
Is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one
Is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes
Oh, yeah
Alright
Feels good
Inside

Flip on the telly
Wrestle with Jimmy
Somethin' is bubblin'
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
So try and be cool
When I say
"This way
Is a water slide away from me that takes you further every day"
So be cool
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

Dear daddy, I write you
In spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus
Things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Stephen's
Awakens ancient feelin's
Like father, stepfather
The son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah


Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker
