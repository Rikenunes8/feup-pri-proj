[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above
The din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mother chants her litany
Of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
[Chorus]
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake
[Verse 2]
Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered
Through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
[Pre-Chorus 2]
The secretaries pout and preen like
Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
[Chorus]
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch
[Guitar solo][Verse 3]
Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings
Into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home
Now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
[Chorus]
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake
[Outro]
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
