[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm just so glad you're mine
Whoa-ho, baby, why did it take so long?
Oh baby, only made my love grow strong
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine
[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsake me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm not gonna leave you alone
Baby, on top of that, I'll give you what you want
Baby, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine
[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsake me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Woo-hoo, boy, hey, hey
[Outro]
I know you'll never say, baby (Baby)
Baby, I'm gonna turn my back and walk away now
Baby, baby, I'll see you another day
Hey baby, hey baby, I'm so, I'm so
Thankful for your love, angel
Thankful for your love, angel baby
Glad you're mine
Ah (Thankful for your love), hey, hey, hey, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, thankful for your love
