If I had ever been here before
I would probably know just what to do
Don't you?
If I had ever been here before
On another time around the wheel
I would probably know just how to deal
With all of you
And I feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
And you know, it makes me wonder
What's going on under the ground
Do you know?
Don't you wonder
What's going on down under you?
We have all been here before
We have all been here before
We have all been here before
We have all been here before
