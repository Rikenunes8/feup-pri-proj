[Intro: Beyoncé (& Missy Elliott)]
(Uh, uh, uh)
Ooh-ooh (Uh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Uh uh uh)
Ooh-oh no, ooh (Say what?)
Ooh-ooh no-no (Verse 1)
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
The day you pissed me off, I told
Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin', and
I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me if I needed a friend
He took me to his house
And then he invited me in (Say what?)
Then we sat on the couch, he put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin', then he
Gently grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before
So, you know what happened
Baby, I need to say no more
[Chorus: Destiny's Child (& Beyoncé)]
I'm just confessing (Confessing)
'Bout the things I did (Oh yeah)
I might as well come clean (Yeah yeah)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just confessing (Yeah)
'Bout the things I did (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
I might as well come clean (Come clean)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing (Guessing, yeah)
That you're through with me
'Cause I just came clean (Please don't be through with me)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me? (Are you through with me?)
'Cause I just came clean (Yeah)
What you feel about that? (Verse 2)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé (& Missy Elliott)]
Remember the time you wondered
Where your money went?
I called my friends and bought some clothes
And took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a Jeep
And we talked all the time
He asked me 'bout my man
And you know that I had to lie
He thought I had no man and I was chillin' by myself
Don't get mad, 'cause I felt sad
That's why I must confess
Too many times I wanted to
Let you know my dirt
But every time you said you loved me
I knew it would hurt[Chorus: Destiny's Child (& Beyoncé)]
I'm just confessing (Confessing, yeah)
'Bout the things I did (Oh-whoa)
I might as well come clean (Come clean)
What you feel about that, baby? (Oh-ooh)
I'm just confessing (Confessing)
'Bout the things I did (Yeah)
I might as well come clean (Come clean, hey)
What you feel about that, baby? (Come clean, hey-yeah)
I'm just guessing
That you're through with me (Are you through with me?)
'Cause I just came clean (Came clean)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing (Guessing)
Are you through with me? (Are you through with me?)
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that? (Ooh, hey le-le-le-le-looh)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I was mad, what was I to do? (Hey)
I never had it in mind to play on you (Oh-ooh)
But look at all the hurt you put me through (Whoa)
I can't tell a lie, so I'm tellin' the truth (Oh-ooh)
I was mad, what was I to do? (Say what?)
I never had it in mind to play on you (Ooh)
But look at all the hurt you put me through
You know, you know (You know)
I was mad, what was I to do? (I to do)
I never had it in mind to play on you (Play on you)
But look at all the hurt you put me through (Oh-ooh)
I can't tell a lie, so I'm tellin' the truth (No no, no-ooh)
I was mad, what was I to do? (Oh-ooh)
I never had it in mind to play on you (Hey)
But look at all the hurt you put me through (Oh)
You know, you know (Oh-ooh, oh-ooh)[Chorus: Destiny's Child (& Beyoncé)]
I'm just confessing (Confessing)
