Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hop that shot your woman down
I said yes sir, my name is Willie Lee
If you got a warrant, just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sorе
I thought I was her daddy but she had five morе
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on train and it took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Got up next morning about a half past nine
Spied a sheriff coming down the line
Hopped and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, come on you dirty hop into that district court
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before that jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, lordy lordy, have mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman downCome on you hops and listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
