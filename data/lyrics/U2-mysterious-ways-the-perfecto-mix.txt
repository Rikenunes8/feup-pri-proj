Johnny take a dive
With your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things
You can’t explain
To touch is to heal
To hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky
Better learn how to kneel
On your knees boy
She’s slippy
You’re sliding down
She’ll be there
When you hit the ground
It’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Oh love

Better learn how to kneel
On your knees boy
She wants you
You don’t know why
She sees the man
Inside the child
YeahIt’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
She moves in mysterious ways (oh yeah)
It’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah
Love
It’s alright, it’s alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, love
Oh-oh love
Oh love love
Move
Baby love me
Move it baby
Love time
Lift my days, light up my nights
Love
