[Verse 1]
Girl, I can't believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye?
See you're taking away my reason for living
And you won't even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
There's something I want you to know
[Chorus]
That I could never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
(I could never love another)
Cause none can compare
After loving you
[Verse 2]
It was only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
Baby, you said long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave me behind
Listen, baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way[Chorus]
'Cause I could never, never, never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other will I share
(I could never love another)
'Cause none, none can compare
After loving you
[Bridge]
So, baby, please stay beside me
I need your sweet love to guide me
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I could never love another)
Ooh, after loving you
(I could never love another after loving you)
[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, baby, it was only, only, only, only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
I remember you said
Long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave, leave me behind
Listen, baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way[Chorus]
I could never, never, never, never, ever love another after loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
(I could never love another)
'Cause none, none can compare
After loving you
[Outro]
Ooh, baby, on my bended knees I'm beggin you to stay here with me
Ooh
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I could never, never, ever, never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
(I could never love another)
'Cause none can compare
After loving you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I could never love another)
