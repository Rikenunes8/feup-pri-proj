[Intro]
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down now
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more
[Verse 1]
Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread
The able-bodied have shipped away
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read
You'll be married in a month, they say
These leaves are crazy
Look at this town there's no men left
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef
[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shoveling
Tokyo Rose on the radio
She says she's leavin' but she don't go
[Verse 2]
Out of the blue just passing through
A young flight sergeant on two weeks leave
Says "Molly McGee, no one else will do"
And seals the tea leaf prophecy
Oh, these nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform
[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
But summer's just a sneeze in a long, long, bad winter cold
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go
[Verse 3]
Sleep little darlin'
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned
Don't have kids when you get grown
Because this world is shattered
The wise are mourning, the fools are joking
Oh, what does it matter?
The wash needs ironing and the fire needs stoking[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go
[Chorus]
She plants her garden in the spring
They do the winter shoveling
They sit up late and watch The Johnny Carson Show
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go
