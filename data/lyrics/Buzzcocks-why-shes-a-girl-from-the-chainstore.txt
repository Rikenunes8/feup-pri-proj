[Chorus 1]
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Why she's a girl from the chain store
She told me my attitude was wrong
I had to find out where she came from
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Her name was written on her coat
Her life was a miserable anecdote
[Verse]
She loved her mother and her father
They never missed her birthday
Listen to everything they said
Like "Never miss your birthday"
[Chorus 2]
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Why she's a girl from the chain store
A product of environment
Another flesh wound in a tenement
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Why she's a girl from the chain store
[Chorus 3]
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Facing Bernstein's barrier
Waiting for someone to marry her
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Why she's a girl from the chain store
Down there at the discotheque
Waiting for someone to bite her neck
