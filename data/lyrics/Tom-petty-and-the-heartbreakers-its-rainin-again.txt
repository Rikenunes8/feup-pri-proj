Well it's rainin' again, rainin' again
Roll up your window honey it's rainin' again
It's dark in the sky, dark in the sky
Make me feel funny honey it's dark in the sky
Rainin' again
Well it's rainin' again, rainin' again
Roll up your window baby it's rainin' again
It's dark in the sky, dark in the sky
Make me feel funny honey it's dark in the sky
