[Verse 1]
Ten PM 'til four and I came to hit the floor
Thought you knew before, but if you don't, then now you know
Yo, tonight I'm 'bout to mash, make them other chicks so mad
I'm 'bout to shake my ass, snatch that boy (so fast)
[Pre-Chorus]
It's all about me and you, doing how we do
Tear the floor up-up-up, tell 'em to make room
If they wanna know, tell 'em mind their own
But if they wanna look, we can give 'em a encore
[Chorus]
Make it a freakshow, freakshow
We can give 'em a peep-peepshow, peep-peepshow
Don't stop it, let it flow, let your inhibitions go
It's a crazy night, let's make a-make a freakshow
[Post-Chorus]
Make it a freak-freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow
Make it a freak-freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow
[Verse 2]
Make 'em clap when we perform, wanna be crazy? We can show 'em
Dancing table top, freaky freaky, so outside the norm
On some super star ish,
 
pushing hot Bugatti whips
Rocking new designer fits, we can do it if you're with it
[Pre-Chorus]
It's all about me and you, doing how we do
Tear the floor up, up, tell 'em to make room
If they wanna know, tell 'em mind their own
But if they wanna look, we can give 'em a encore
[Chorus]
Make it a freakshow, freakshow
We can give 'em a peep-peepshow, peep-peepshow
Don't stop it, let it flow, let your inhibitions go
It's a crazy night, let's make a-make a freakshow[Post-Chorus]
Make it a freak-freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow
Make it a freak-freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow
[Bridge]
Me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
[Chorus]
Make it a freakshow, freakshow
We can give 'em a peep-peepshow, peep-peepshow
Don't stop it, let it flow, let your inhibitions go
It's a crazy night, let's make a-make a freakshow
[Outro]
Make it a, make it a
Me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
