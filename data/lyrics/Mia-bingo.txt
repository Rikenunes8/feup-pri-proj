[Chorus]
Can you keep a secret
From them other people
If I tell you 'bout 
wha-gwan
?
And would you let me know
If I forget the secret
Took my eye off of the ball?
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I know what's going on
I know how you going on
I got the ra-ra
Go ahead and throw the ball
I don't be runnin' at all
I got my own goal
I stand in one place
And make sure I just hit the ball
[Chorus]
Can you keep a secret
From them other people
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan?
And would you let me know
If I forget the secret
Took my eye off of the ball?
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
[Verse 2]
Yeah, you drink too much Rum
You make me wanna run
I make no assumption
Ass will get the hump, I'm done
What's the point of talkin' gun?
I done been Brixton bombed
That's why I don't run
For the sake of havin' fun[Chorus]
Can you keep a secret
From them other people
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan?
And would you let me know
If I forget the secret
Took my eye off of the ball?
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
