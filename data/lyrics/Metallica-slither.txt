[Chorus 1]
Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
[Verse 1]
Ohh, watch the puppets dancing
Yeah, see the clowns fall down
Hey, tie your tap shoes tightly
Yeah, and wear them into town
[Chorus 2]
See you crawling
See you crawling in
[Chorus 1]
Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here no more
[Verse 2]
Hey hey hey
Ooh, play the game so nicely
Oh, check, its your move now
Yeah, we are standing in this jungle
Yeah, with serpents I have found
[Chorus 2]
See you crawling
See you crawling in
[Chorus 1]
Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Then your heroes disappeared[Chorus 2]
See you crawling
See you crawling in
[Chorus 1]
Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
No there ain't no heroes here no more
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here, looking for snakes you might find them
Haven't I seen you before?
Then your heroes disappeared
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them, yeah
