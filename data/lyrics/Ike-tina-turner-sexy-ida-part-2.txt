Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it with the spider
She's got his long black hair
It's a hangin' on down her back
Long black pretty legs
And she walks just like a cat
Hypnotic eyes
And a stacked up love sacks
She not only wants your love
She wants your life after that don't do it
Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
And you better not try it
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it on the spider
She's got a kingsized bed
With satin sheets of love
And you'll never wanna leave now
The web of love she weaves
But I'll tell you
Don't give your love to sexy Ida . . 
You gotta beware of sexy Ida
'Cause she tries to look co sweef and kind
But her looks can be deceivin'
'Cause her love is like strychnine
So don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
And not give your love to Ida
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it on the spider
No
No don't give your love to sexy Ida
