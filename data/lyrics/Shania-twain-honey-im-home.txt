[Verse 1]
The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My pantyline shows
, 
got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man, I hate that (Hate that)
Oh, just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS
[Pre-Chorus]
This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey)
Hey
[Chorus]
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home[Verse 2]
I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain; it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain
[Pre-Chorus]
This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home[Bridge]
Oh, rub my neck, will you?
Yeah, woo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home
[Outro]
Mmm, I'm home
Oh
Oh, that feels much better
