[Verse 1]
Is that you, your eyes slowly fading?
Is that you, your mind full of tears?
Is that you, searchin' for a good time?
Is that you, waitin' for all these years?
[Chorus]
And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes, I hope you're feelin' good
Yes, I hope you're feelin' better
[Verse 2]
Is that you, look across the ocean
Is that you, thinkin nothing's really there?
Is that you, waiting for the sunshine?
Is that you, when all you see is glare?
[Chorus]
And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes, I hope you're feelin' good
Yes, I hope you're feelin' better
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
Is that you, who never saw your baby?
Is that you, who never had a friend?
Is that you, movin' to a new town?
Is that you, will diamonds replace your friends?
[Chorus]
And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes, I hope you're feelin' good
Well I hope you're feelin' better
