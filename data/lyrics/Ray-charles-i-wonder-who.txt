[Verse]
I...I wonder who gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone
I wonder who gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone
I wonder who, baby, gonna be carrying my loving on
You know if you find, you know if you find
You know if you find, you know if you find
You know if you find a new love, baby, won't you please tell me so
Well, it might break my heart but still I wanna know
And if the flame, I said if the flame
You heard me, if the flame, don't you know if the flame
If the flame in your heart only burns true love for me
Well, don't you let nobody turn their backs on me
You know when I, I say when I
You know when I, don't you know when I
When I lost my baby, I lost the best friend I ever had
And If I don't find my baby, hey hey hey, it's gonna drive me mad, yeah
