[Verse 1]
Well, it's been building up inside of me for
Oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why, but I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
[Chorus]
And she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
[Verse 2]
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
[Chorus]
When she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
[Verse 3]
She told me "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby, nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me
[Chorus]
And she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
