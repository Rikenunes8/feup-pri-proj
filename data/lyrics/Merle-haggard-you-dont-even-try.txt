Our love keeps drifting and you keep giving me the blame
I go on loving you although it's all in vain
Now you've stopped caring, so what chance have you and I?
I give my everything, but you don't even try
I've done all I can do and I'm standing at the end
Although I know it's over, my heart just won't give in
