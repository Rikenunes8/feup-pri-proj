[Intro]
Alright
Now dig this, baby
[Verse 1]
You don't care for me
I don't care about that
You got a new fool, ha!
I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire
[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire (Hey! Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Whoa, let me stand baby)
Let me stand next to your fire (Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Yeah baby)
[Verse 2]
Listen here, baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom ain't home
It ain't my concern
Just play with me and you won't get burned
I have only one itching desire
Let me stand next to your fire
[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire (Yeah! Let me stand baby)
Let me stand next to your fire (Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh!)
[Bridge]
Oh! Move over, Rover
And let Jimi take over
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
Yeah, get on with it, baby[Guitar solo]
Yeah
That's what I'm talking about
Now dig this!
Ha!
[Verse 3]
Now listen, baby
You try to give me your money
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire
[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh! Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (I ain't gonna do you no harm)
Let me stand next to your fire
[Outro]
Ow, yeah, you better move over baby
I ain't gonna hurt ya baby
Ah, I ain't talkin' with your old lady
Ow, ah yes this is Jimi talkin' to you
