[Chorus]
I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at any time
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind
[Verse]
Within me, there's a prison surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon with its walls of stone
I know running's not the answer
But running's been my nature
And a part of me that keeps me moving on
[Chorus]
I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at any time
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind
[Chorus]
I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at any time
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind
