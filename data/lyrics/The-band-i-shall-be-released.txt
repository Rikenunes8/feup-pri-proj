[Verse 1]
They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
[Chorus]
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
[Verse 2]
They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall
[Chorus]
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
[Verse 3]
Now, yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long, I hear him shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed
[Chorus]
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
