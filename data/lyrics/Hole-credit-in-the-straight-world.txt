[Intro]
And I will await your highness
I'm so high I cannot walk
And I will await
You cripple, you take away my time
My peace, my empathy
No babies sleep on atrophy
Your unborn love and fetal stress
Hard bitter candy, legless caress
[Verse 1]
Go for credit in the straight world
Look a dealer in the eye
Go for credit in the real world
Won't you try?
[Chorus]
I got some credit in the straight world
I lost a leg, I lost an eye
Go for credit in the real world
You will die
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Instant credit in the straight world
Leave your money when you die
Lots of credit in the real world
Gets you high
Yeah
[Chorus]
I got some credit in the straight world
I lost a leg, I lost an eye
Go for credit in the real world
You will die
Yeah
[Outro]
Oh!
