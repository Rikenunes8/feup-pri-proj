I can't say it more than once
'Cause I'm thinking twice as fast
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Everything I like is nice
That's why I try to have it twice
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, lay-da-day
Well, once I saw a bore
Who was a social whore
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
And they said I had a limp
And then they tried to pass around I was a pimp
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Was on my last leg
I couldn't even borrow my friend's extra peg at all
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Once I turned red
And it looked funny in the head
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day, Yodel-ayde-lay-da-day
