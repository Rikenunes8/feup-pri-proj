[Pre-Chorus]
Grace, space, race
[Verse]
Everything they've seen, you have seen
Everywhere they've been, you have been
Everything they've done, you have been
And done already
Every lovely spot, near or far
You can reach them, too, in your car
Or you might be there now
If you own a jag already
[Bridge]
The radio blasting
The girls are glancing
The dash is dancing
With gleaming dials
[Pre-Chorus]
Grace, space, pace
Grace, space, race
[Chorus]
Jaguar
Jaguar
Jaguar
[Outro]
Jaguar
(Yeah!)
