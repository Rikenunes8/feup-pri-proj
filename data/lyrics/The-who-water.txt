[Verse 1]
The foreman over there hates the gang
The poor people on the porch get it so rough
The truck driver drives like a devil
The policemen - they're acting so tough
They need water
Good, good water
We need water
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say, "no" to somebody's daughter
(No[?] no[?] no[?] no[?] no[?])
Sampson seems sorta sweaty
The draftsmen- they smudged their work
The captain of a ship is swimming
Then just wore off a keen bank clerk
[Chorus]
We need water
Good, good water
We need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
[Verse 2]
Come on, gimme good water[x3]
Please don't refuse me, mister
I've seen your daughter at the oasis
And I'm beginning to blister
A Chevrolet just made steam
Your crop is laying fallow
My grass skirt's lost its green
I'm alive, but I don't know how
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Gimme good water
Indian Lake is burning
New York's skyline is hazy
The River Thames is turning dry
The whole world is a-blazing
[Chorus][Outro]
Ah, gimme what I need
Please, water, water, water, water, water, water
Gimme water
Water
Water
(Water[?])
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say "no" to somebody's daughter
(Oh, no)
Whoa[?]
No, no, no, no, no[?]
No, whoa
