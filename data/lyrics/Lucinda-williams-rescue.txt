He can't rescue you
Can't pull the demons from your head
Can't lull you from your sleepy bed
He can't rescue you
He can't protect you
From the powers that will be
The hours of insanity
He can't protect you
He can't change you
Change the summers of your beauty
The thunderstorms within your purity
He can't change you
He can't carry you
Past the door of every danger
Every foe and every stranger
He can't carry you
He can't save you
From the plain and simple truth
The waning winters of your youth
He can't save you
He can't fix you
Your tears will always leave their mark
From fears that stay inside the dark
He can't fix you
What can he do
But tie some ribbons in your hair
And show you that he'll always care
Thats all he can do
Lala lala...
