[Chorus]
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there
[Verse 1]
If you need somebody to love, just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight
[Chorus]
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there
[Verse 2]
If the sun has faded away, I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
, I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you
[Chorus]
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there
[Chorus]
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there
[Outro]
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there
