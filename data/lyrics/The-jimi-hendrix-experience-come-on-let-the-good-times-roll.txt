[Verse 1]
People talking but they just don't know
What's in my heart, and why I love you so
I love you, baby, like a miner loves gold
Come on, sugar, let the good times roll
Hey!
[Verse 2]
So many people live in make-believe
They keep a lot of dirt up their sleeves
But my love, baby, is no kind that folds
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Hey!
[Bridge]
Let the good times roll
Aw, let me, baby, come on and let Daddy fill your soul
Baby, let the good times roll
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Oh, love is nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you're feeling good
You got me flipping like a flag on a pole
Come on, sugar, let the good times roll
[Outro]
Hey!
Let the good times roll
Hey! Fill me, baby
I'm talkin' the good times roll
Come on and let me fill your soul
Hey, let the good times roll
