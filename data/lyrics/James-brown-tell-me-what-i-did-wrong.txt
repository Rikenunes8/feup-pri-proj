[Chorus]
Walked up to my baby
Walked right up to my baby
Tell me what have I done wrong
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
[Verse 1]
There something about you baby
Something 'bout you baby
That I just can't understand
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
I phantom some other man
[Verse 2]
Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time
Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
I am still a worry on your mind
[Chorus]
Walked up to my baby
Walked right up to my baby
Tell me what have I done wrong
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
