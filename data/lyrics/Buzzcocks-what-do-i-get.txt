[Verse 1]
I just want a lover like any other, what do I get?
I only want a friend who'll stay to the end, what do I get?
[Chorus]
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
[Verse 2]
I'm in distress, I need a caress, what do I get?
I'm not on the make, I just need a break, what do I get?
[Chorus]
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
[Post-Chorus]
I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you, things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead
[Chorus]
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get? Ah
[Interlude]
[Post-Chorus]
I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you, things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead
[Chorus]
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?[Verse 3]
I just want a lover like any other, what do I get?
I only want a friend who'll love to the end, what do I get?
[Chorus]
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
[Outro]
Well, let me tell you now
(What do I get? What do I get?)
(What do I get?) No love
(What do I get?) No sleep at nights
(What do I get?) Nothing that's nice
(What do I get?) Nothing at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
'Cause I don't get you
