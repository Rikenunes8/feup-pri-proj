[Verse 1]
Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life, I've always been so blue
[Refrain]
Born to lose
Now I'm losing you
[Verse 2]
Born to lose
My every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dome
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
[Refrain]
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Born to lose
Now I'm losing you
[Verse 3]
Well, you know
I loved you, oh, it's true
You've brought me pain
And dare I loved you too
[Refrain]
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you
