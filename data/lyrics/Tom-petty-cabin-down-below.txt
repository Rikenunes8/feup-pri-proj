[Chorus 1]
Come on, go with me, babe
Come on, go with me, girl
Baby, let's go to the cabin down below
[Chorus 2]
I got a radio
Put it on soft and low
Baby, let's go to the cabin down below
[Verse 1]
Well, I've had my eye on you
For a long, long time
I'm watching everything you do
Baby, you're gonna be mine
[Chorus 1]
Come on, go with me, babe
Come on, go with me, girl
Baby, let's go to the cabin down below
[Verse 2]
Well, time's been moving slow
Since we both got here
Come on, slide a little closer
Let me whisper in your ear
[Chorus 3]
Well I got a radio
Turn it on soft and low
Baby, let's go to the cabin down below
Yeah, baby, let's go to the cabin down below
Baby, let's love in the cabin down below
