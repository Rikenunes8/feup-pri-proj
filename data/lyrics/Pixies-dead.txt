[Intro]
"Whatchu think of nothing?"
"I'd like to do a nursery rhyme."
[Verse 1]
You crazy babe Bathsheba, I wantcha
You're suffocating, you need a good shed
I'm tired of living, Shebe, so gimme
[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!
[Verse 2]
We're apin' rapin' tapin' catharsis
You get torn down and I get erected
My blood is working but my, my heart is...
[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!
Dead!
[Bridge]
Hey, what do you know?
Your lovely tan belly is starting to grow[Verse 3]
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!
