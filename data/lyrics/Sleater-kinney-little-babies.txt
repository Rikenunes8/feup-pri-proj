I'm the water I'm the dishes I'm the suds
I will comfort, make you clean, help you cope
When you're tired feeling helpless
Come inside I am the shelter
And then when you're feeling better I'll
Watch you go
Dum dum dee dee dum dum dee dum do
All the little babies go oh oh I want to
Dum dum dee dee dum dum dee dum yeah
Rock the little babies with one two three four
Are you hungry?
Did you eat before the show?
I peeled potatoes set the table washed the floor
I know the others treat you rough
And when you know you've had enough
You'll come and see me 'cause you know
I'm always here
Dum dum dee dee dum dum dee dum do
All the little babies go oh oh I want to
Dum dum dee dee dum dum dee dum yeah
Rock the little babies with one two three four
Momma's little helper
Momma's little helper
Momma's little helper
Momma's little helper
Dum dum dee dee dum dum dee dum do
All the little babies go oh oh I want to
Dum dum dee dee dum dum dee dum yeah
Rock the little babies with one two three four
