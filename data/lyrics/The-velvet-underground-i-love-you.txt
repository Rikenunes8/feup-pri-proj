[Verse 1]
Ah, you've got such understanding ways
I believe everything that you say
Smiling faces not forgotten 'cause
I love you
[Verse 2]
When I think of all the things we've done
And we haven't even yet begun
Smiling faces not forgotten 'cause
I love you
[Bridge]
Just for a little while
Oh, just to see you smile
Just for a little while
[Verse 1]
You've got such understanding ways
Oh, and I believe, I believe every word that you say
Smiling faces not forgotten 'cause
I love you
