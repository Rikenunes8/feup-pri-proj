Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel in the gorge
And Turtle, that friend of hers, with his checks all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk, and his cheese in the cash
They’re all gonna be there at that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Everybody from right now to over there and back
The louder they come, the bigger they crack
Come now, sweet cream, don’t forget to flash
We’re all gonna meet at that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn
Then 
along came Jones
, emptied the trash
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Well, I’m hitting it too hard, my stones won’t take
I get up in the morning but it’s too early to wake
First it’s hello, goodbye then push and then crash
But we’re all gonna make it at that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist
I punched myself in the face with my fist
I took my potatoes down to be mashed
Then I made it on over to that million dollar bashOoh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
