[Hook: Malik B.]
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
Yo, the mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
[Verse 1: Malik B.]
Look, akh, I walk around a little edgy already
Y'all MC's come into my face, but my aim's steady
M-Illatant is skilled in most strategic plan
I float across seas and breeze across land
Standing, in these thoughts of murder within
Destructor of this world that's corrupted with sin
I'm always hitting, to leave MC's guessing
For any transgression, in my perimeter
There will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated
Buddha session, to stop stressing
Me with the madness, putting niggas on my had list
No sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt
Jim Carrey-ass niggas start to melt
Impact like a buckle being swung from off a belt
Any help for shelter, when in the realms of a welter
My weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter
My attitude a product of society
So sometimes, for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me
Niggas eyeing me with looks of they anxiety
Wondering what's in my heart, velocity or piety
Yo, it depends on which one you bring to surface
At times, I get trife, but what! To worship is my purpose
Malik B blend with the tree, to spot an enemy
You clogging me up, cat, now vacate the vicinity
[Hook: Malik B.]
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
Yo, the mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
[Verse 2: Malik B.]
I'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik
Don't approach with bullshit—I'm quick to call it invalid
Route through your district, we keep it simplistic
No need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt
Show me the vault or the safe, 'cause I'm on the paper chase
Wade through route states for 'bout thirty down my waist
I'm tryna get it; these rain-bottling thoughts become acidic
With one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it
A girlfriend and teammate, million cash just split it
I take what you got to give 'cause I got to live
The last hour, I bet your ass you wax sour
Might act up, but I still can pass 
Da'wah
I'm using new ways to try to reach these better days
Instead of tryna take you under, I just make you wonder
I still fast, make salaat, and pay zakaat
I didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project
Living two lives: one of turn and one with true lies
Keeping up hope, knowing He's answering to my du'as
In the quarters, living modest with my nigga, Trotter
I circle my foes like a Tawaf around the Kaaba
I used to live life like it was no mañana
Now, I'm treating every breath like it was Your Honor
M-Illa-tillatant with the Fifth that stand firm like a pillar
I'm I-N-T-L like Manila[Hook: Malik B.]
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
Yo, the mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
Yo, the mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit
[Outro: Malik B.]
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
