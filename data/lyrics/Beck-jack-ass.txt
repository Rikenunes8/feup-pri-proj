[Verse 1]
I've been drifting along
In the same stale shoes
Loose ends tying a noose
In the back of my mind
[Chorus 1]
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together
It's a strange invitation
[Verse 2]
When I wake up
Someone will sweep up my lazy bones
And we will
Rise in the cool of the evening
[Chorus 2]
I remember the way that you smiled
When the gravity shackles were wild
And something is vacant
When I think it's all beginning
[Verse 3]
I've been drifting along
In the same stale shoes
Loose ends tying a noose
In the back of my mind
[Chorus 1]
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together
It's a strange invitation
