[Verse 1]
Who-who-who-who'd it be? that me and he
Are tighter than J-Lo in the jeans
And could it be that me and he
Are tighter than R. Kelly in his teens?
But you're fuckin' with my man
And you text him all the time
You mighta had him once
But I got him all the time

[Chorus]
U-R-A-Q-T
Is your dad a dealer? 'Cause you're dope to me
You throw them balls across the country
You win gold medals for when you're with me
You big dummy
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on[Verse 2]
He ain't no ball for Scrabble
You don't get points for doubles
Ménage à trois, la-la-la-la-la
I'll bill you for your droodles
You done lost your marble
Like a ball, I'll make you dribble
You're the shrapnels in the rubble
I'm a raging bull, a rebel
You big dummy!
It's all about the low blow, brown girl
The no blood, no love, hot girl
The jukin', jukin', jumpin' off the decks girl
The jukin', jukin', jumpin' off the rocks girl
You big dummy!
[Chorus]
U-R-A-Q-T
Is your dad a dealer? 'Cause you're dope to me
You throw them balls across the country
You win gold medals for when you're with me
You big dummy!
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
Right then, it's on, right then, it's on
You big dummy!
