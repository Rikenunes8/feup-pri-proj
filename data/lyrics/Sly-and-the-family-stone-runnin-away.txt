Running away to get away
Ha-ha, ha-ha
You're wearing out your shoes
Look at you fooling you
Making blues of night and day
Hee-hee, hee-hee
You're stretching out your dues
Look at you fooling you
Shorter cut is quicker but
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Time is here to stay
Look at you fooling you
The deeper in debt, the harder you bet
Hee-hee, hee-hee
You need more room to play
Look at you fooling you
Another day, you're farther away
Ha-ha, ha-ha
A longer trip back home
