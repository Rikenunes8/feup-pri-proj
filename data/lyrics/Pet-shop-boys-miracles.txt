[Verse 1]
Clouds drift away
When they see you
Rain wouldn't dare
To fall near you here
Miracles happen
When you're around
Somehow the grass is much greener
Rivers flow faster and cleaner
Being with you
No matter where
Sunlight breaks through
And suddenly there's
[Chorus]
A bluer sky
Whenever you're around
You always bring
A bluer sky
A brighter day
[Verse 2]
Thunder is silent before you
Roses bloom more to adore you too
Miracles happen
When you're around
The sunset is deeper and longer
The scent of the jasmine is stronger
Stray dogs don't bite
Birds start to sing
Lightning daren't strike
You suddenly bring[Chorus]
A bluer sky
Whenever you're around
You always bring
A bluer sky
A brighter day
Birds fly
Even higher in the sky
Sun shines
It's a new day
It's a new day
[Bridge]
Being with you
No matter where
Sunlight breaks through
And suddenly there's
[Chorus]
A bluer sky
Whenever you're around
You always bring
A bluer sky
A brighter day
(Miracles happen)
Birds fly
Even higher in the sky
(Miracles happen)
Sun shines
It's a new day
(Miracles happen)
Sun shines
It's a new day
