[Verse 1]
Jiving Sister 
Fanny
, told her man from Philadelphia, PA
Uh, huh, huh, huh
He tore down the station, said she didn't like the way we played
Uh, huh, huh, huh
[Verse 2]
If you got a different guy, bitch you better be the one
Hanging from the duties by the cold grab you by the while
Woo ooh child, you got me walking down a broad highway
Uh, huh, huh, huh

Now, Jivin' Sister Fanny got the brain of a dinosaur
Uh, huh, huh, huh
Well, she hocked my fancy motor
And she hocked my electric guitar
Uh, huh, huh, huh
[Verse 4]
Then she's waiting in the store
That's the way, the way to go
Now she's found the way to go
Good bye Charlie, get your way
Ah ooh, child, you got me walking down a broad highway
And ah c'mon boy, I want you to bust that out
[Guitar Solo]
Ah yeah, woo!
Ah ooh, child, you got me walking down a broad highway
Uh, huh, huh, huh
Now, now, now
[Verse 5]
Jivin' sister Fanny brought a man down a broad highway
Yeah she even took the question
And she didn't like the games we played
Na na na na na na yeah
You've got my way around
You got me outta town
A man from Philadelphia
Forget about the public house
Woo child, you got me walking down a broad highway
Woo![Verse 6]
Jivin' sister Fanny got the brain of a dinosaur
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
Woo hoo hoo

You got me wild about your baby child
Woo, na na, uh huh huh, uh huh huh huh
