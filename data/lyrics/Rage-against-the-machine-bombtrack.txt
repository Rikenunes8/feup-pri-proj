[Intro]
Uhh
Ayo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack
[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn
[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
[Verse 2]
It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn
[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
Hey, yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
Check it out
[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn
