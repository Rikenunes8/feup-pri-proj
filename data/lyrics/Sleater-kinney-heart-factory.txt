We're manufacturing hearts we've got the perfect thing
The word on the street we've got the new love machine
Heart with and on/off switch and a remote control
Now you can program how you feel before you walk out the door
Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into
Well you can leave 'em hot and you can leave 'em cold
And you can give 'em what you want and you can get up and go
And you can take your heart out and you can put it back in
I think we found the way to put the fun back in sin
Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into
It's not like an organ more like a valentine
It's cherry cherry red and it beats on time, time, time, time
We're trying to reduce the heart on heart crime
You bring your heart to us we'll get it purified
Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into
