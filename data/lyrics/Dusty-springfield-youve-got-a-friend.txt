Mmm, when you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothing, oh nothing, is going right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running (oh yeah), to see you again, oh, oh
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
If the sky up above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old cold, north wind begins to blow, oh, oh, oh
Just keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon, you'll hear me knocking at your door, ooh, hoo
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come run, run, run, run, running to see you again, oh, oh
Winter, spring, summer or fall, yeah
Said all you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Oh, ain't it good to know that
You've got a friend?
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them, ha
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, running, run, running to see you again, ooh, hoo
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend, oh, baby
You've got a friend, oh, oh, baby
You've got a friend, ooh, honey
You got, you got a friend, ooh, hoo
You've got a friend
I said, you've got a friend
