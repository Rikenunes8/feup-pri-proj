It's a big job just gettin' by with nine kids and a wife
But I've been a workin' man dang near all my life
I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these workin' man blues
I keep my nose on the grindstone, I work hard every day
Might get a little tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay
But I'll go back workin'
Come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew
I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these workin' man blues
Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin around
I wanna throw my bills out the window
Catch a train to another town
But I go back workin'
I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
I drink a little beer in a tavern
Cry a little bit of these working man blues
[Electric guitar bridge]
Hey hey, the working man, the working man like me
I ain't never been on welfare, that's one place I won't be
Cause I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I drink a little beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues
