[Intro]
Ohh, baby
What you gonna do, baby?
[Verse 1]
I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I thought we could make a new start
You left me broken-hearted from the day your love departed
Now that love you found with someone new is gone
And so you wanna come back
[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
[Verse 2]
Sweet memories of yesterday when it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you know that woman that you learned to leave today
And itâ€™s a shame that you wanna come back now, baby
My love is gone away
[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
[Verse 3]
I played the fool for ya, baby
And you stole away my heart
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love is gone away
Sweet memories of yesterday
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love is gone away[Chorus Repeat and Ad-libs Until Fade]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
