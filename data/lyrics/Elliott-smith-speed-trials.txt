[Verse 1]
He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet, high notes that echo back
To destroy their master
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are
[Chorus]
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place
[Verse 2]
When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough?
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah, you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance
[Chorus]
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials standing in place
It's just a brief smile crossing your face
I'm running speed trials all over the place
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
