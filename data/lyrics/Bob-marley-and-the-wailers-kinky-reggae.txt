[Verse 1]
Uh, ah-oh-oh! I went downtown, (I went downtown)
I saw Miss Brown; (Said, I saw Miss Brown)
She had brown sugar (Had brown sugar)
All over her booga-wooga (Over her booga-wooga)
I think I might join the fun, (I might join the fun)
But I had to hit and run (Had to hit and run)
See I just can't settle down (Just can't settle down)
In a kinky part of town
Ride on
Don't you know I've got to (Ride on), oh baby
Ride on; see I just can't settle down (Ride on)
Oh, I'm a leaving town (Kinky reggae)

Kinky reggae, take me away! (Kinky reggae, now) Kinky reggae, now!
Oh, kinky reggae; all I've got to say, kinky reggae, now!
Kinky reggae, oh baby! Kinky reggae, now!
It's got to be kinky reggae (Keep it up) Kinky reggae, now!
An' I would say: ride on, ride on, ride on (Ride on)!
Oh, ride on, baby!
Ride on, come on, woo-o-o! (Ride on) Wo-now! Eh!
[Verse 2]
I went down to Piccadilly Circus; (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Down there I saw Marcus: (Oo-oo-oo-ooh)
He had a candy tar (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
All over his chocolate bar (Oo-oo-oo-ooh)
I think I might join the fun, (I might join the fun)
But I had to hit and run (Had to hit and run)
See I just can't settle down (Just can't settle down)
In a kinky, kinky part of town
Nice one; that's what they say, (Nice one)
But I'm leaving you today (Nice one)
Oh, darling, please don't pay: (Nice one)
Mama say - mama say[Chorus 2]
