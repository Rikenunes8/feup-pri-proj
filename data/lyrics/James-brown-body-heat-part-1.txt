[Intro]
Unh, yeah
(Body heat)

[Verse 1]
When your body gets down from aggravation
And you need some love from fascination
[Chorus]
What's that? (Body heat)
What's that? (Body heat)
[Verse 2]
When your body won't do what you want it to
And you don't do it because you know you're through
[Chorus]
What's that? (Body heat)
What's that? (Body heat)
[Verse 3]
When you can't get your body please
And you need some love for your tension ease[Chorus]
What's that? (Body heat)
What's that? (Body heat)
Ha, ah, payback
[Bridge]
Ha, ah, got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
You got to cut off the heat, take off that pressure
Cut off the heat, take off that pressure
Turn off the heat, take off that pressure
Turn off the heat, take off that pressure
Gimme some air, I can't go nowhere
I gotta go to church, y'all
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck
Got to release the funk
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck
I got to release the pressure
I got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Got to go to church, y'all
Take me[Verse 4]
When I was a little boy, about the age of one
My mother told me, I'd be a loving son of a gun
When I was a little boy about the age of two
Checked myself, knew what I had to do
When I was a little boy about the age of three
Don't want nobody bothering me
When I was a little boy about the age of four
Back up, I had to check myself, gonna get me some more
[Outro]
Gotta go to church, y'all
Ha, cut off the heat, take off that pressure
Ha, cut off the heat, take off that pressure
Gimme some air, I can't go nowhere
Shucks, gimme some air, I can't go nowhere
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck
I got the (Body heat)
I says I gotta release the pressure (Body heat)
I'm having bad luck, cut off the heat
