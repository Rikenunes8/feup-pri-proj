[Verse 1]
Hey there, Luna
I'd like to tell ya
How sad am I
So love sick I could die
[Verse 2]
Needing water
My neck's stiff
My head hurts
Been lookin' up all night
Been looking up
Moon, she's so bright
[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's so white
She's so clean
I'm telling you
She's everything
I'd give it all
My sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized
[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I was a Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah, I wish I was Yuri-G
Bring back my memory
[Verse 3]
Told by a doctor
You make a figure
Needles stick in her
She'll be your Luna
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I stuck 'em in real clean
I stuck 'em in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I was a Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah, I thought I was Yuri-G
Bring back my memory
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stuck 'em in
I stuck 'em in real clean
I stuck 'em in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized
[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I was a Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah, I thought I was Yuri-G
Bring back my memory
Yeah, I wish a Yuri-G
I'd let her walk all over me
Yeah, I thought I was Yuri-G[Outro]
Bring back my memory
Bring back my memory
Bring back my memory
