[Verse 1]
No, I'm not the man I used to be, lately
See, you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside
[Chorus]
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you 
through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
[Verse 2]
I will beg my way into your garden
And then I'll break my way out, when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)
[Chorus]
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
[Bridge]
Who do you love?
Girl I see through, through your love
Who do you love; me or the thought of me?
Me or the thought of me?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
