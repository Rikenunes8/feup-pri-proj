[Verse 1]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this world keeps on turning, yeah
Let's just be glad we had this time to spend together
There is no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
[Chorus]
Lay your head (lay your head) upon my pillow, sweet baby
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops rolling softly
Against my window, yeah, oh, late at night
Make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
For the good times
[Verse 2]
I'll get along, and I'm sure you'll find another
But baby please remember
I'll be here (I'll be here), I'm gonna stay right here
If you should find you ever need me, yeah
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever and ever and ever and ever
There'll be time enough for severance when you leave me, yeah
For the good times, yeah
For the good times
[Chorus]
Lay your head (lay your head) upon my pillow
Oh, just this one time, girl, one time
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine, yeah, oh baby
Won't you hear the whisper, hear the whisper
Of the raindrops, of the raindrops, rolling softly, softly against my window
All you gotta do is make believe
All you gotta do is make believe you love me one more time
For the good times, yeah baby
For the good times
And here's what you oughta do is
Lay your head upon my pillow
I just wanna hold your warm and tender body close to mine
