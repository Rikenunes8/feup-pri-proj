[Verse 1]
Love ridden
, 
I've looked at you
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles
I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow
And, baby, I wished for you
[Verse 2]
Nobody sees when you are lyin' in your bed
And I wanna crawl in with you but I cry instead
I want your warm but it will only make me colder when it's over
So I can't tonight, baby
[Chorus]
No, not "baby" anymore
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while we'll only have to wave
[Bridge]
My hand won't hold you down no more
The path is clear to follow through
I stood too long in the way of the door
And now I'm giving up on
You
[Chorus]
No, not "baby" anymore
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while we'll only have to wave
No, not "baby" anymore
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while we'll only have to wave
