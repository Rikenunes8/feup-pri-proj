[Verse 1]
Suppose I say
I'm never satisfied
Suppose I say
You cut some root
To make the tree survive
[Chorus 1]
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?
[Verse 2]
Suppose I say
The vultures smile at me
Suppose I say
I've sent them down
And they plan to pick you clean
[Chorus 3]
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Yeah, gone again
[Chorus 2]
Oh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?
Oh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 1]
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm bored to death
[Chorus 3]
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Yeah, gone again
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?
Yeah, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?
