[Verse 1]
My mother told me before she passed away
Said, "Son, when I'm gone don't forget to pray
[Chorus]
Because there'll be hard times, hard times, oh yeah yeah
Who knows better than I?"
[Verse 2]
Well, I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay my rent
[Chorus]
Talking about hard times, hard times, oh yeah yeah
Who knows, oh well, better than I?
[Break]
[Verse 3]
I had a woman, Lord, who was always around
But when I lost my money, then she put me down
[Chorus]
Talking about hard times, you know those hard
Yeah, Lord, who knows better than I?
[Outro]
Yeah, Lord, yeah, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow when I pass away
And no more hard times, I say, "No more hard"
Yeah, Lord, who knows, yeah, Lord, better than I?
