There are two kinds of people
A: My love and I
B: other
There are two kinds of people
One, the gray
And two, me and my lover
All people fall into two camps
That ever twain shall be
Those lost in darkness without lamps
And then, my love and me
All people fall into two camps
That ever twain shall be
Those lost in darkness without lamps
And then, my love and me
