[Verse]
That old white-haired judge in Dallas
Didn't pay my story no mind
They're taking me down to Huntsville
I'm bringing in a load of time
[Verse]
They caught me on a caper that I planned for days
And proved everything I've done
I'm on my way to Huntsville
But I'm looking for a chance to run
[Verse]
My hands don't fit no chopping pole
And cotton never was my bag
The man better keep both eyes on me
Or they're going to lose old Hag
[Chorus]
It ain't so far to Mexico
That I can't find my way
They're taking me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay
[Verse]
They got me chained in leg irons
I guess they got a good excuse
They know I'm gonna run the first chance I get
'Cause they're never gonna cut me loose
[Verse]
And I really don't care if they shoot me down
I'll never be free again
I've got two long life turns to do
Both running and don't end
[Chorus]
It ain't so far to Mexico
That I can't find my way
They're taking me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay
