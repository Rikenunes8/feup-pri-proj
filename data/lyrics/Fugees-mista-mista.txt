[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Mista, mista
Can I get five dollars
So I can get something to eat?
Hell no, motherfucka
You can't get no money from me
'Cause every time I give you a dollar
You go get shot up with more and more needles
And you tell me that you're drug-free
Drug-free
[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Mista, mista
I haven't ate anything for a week
Can I get a quarter?
Hell no, motherfucka
What can a quarter get you?
Nothing, motherfucka
You are just fucked up
Off them fucked up drugs
You know you need to fucking leave alone
But you keep telling me that you're drug-free
Motherfucka
You ain't drug-free
You're a fiend
[Bridge]
And every time I try to help you
You pretend as if it's okay
Then later on the week
You go back
To shootin' needles, to sniffin'
Oh, motherfucka, but you told me you were drug-free
Drug-free
[Outro]
You ain't drug-free, motherfucka
So you damn well can't get no motherfuckin' money from me
