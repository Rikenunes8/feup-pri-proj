[Chorus]
Someday when our dream world finds us
And these hard times are gone
We'll laugh and count our blessings
In a mansion all our own
If we both pull together, tomorrow's sure to come
Someday we'll look back and say it was fun
[Verse]
We live on love and pennies
And a daydream out of sight
And I'm amazed the way you smile
When things don't turn out right
We climb each hill together, each step one by one
And someday we'll look back and say it was fun
[Chorus]
Someday when our dream world finds us
And these hard times are gone
We'll laugh and count our blessings
In a mansion all our own
If we both pull together, tomorrow's sure to come
And someday we'll look back and say it was fun
And someday we'll look back and say it was fun
