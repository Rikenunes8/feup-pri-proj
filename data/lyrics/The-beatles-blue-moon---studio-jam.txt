Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Not a love of my own
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a love in my heart
Without a dream in my own
And then I suddenly  before me
The only one I ever wanted to hold
And then you said you'd come and then you'd adore me
Blue moon, you went to turn into gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone-- hahahaha
