This that gravedigger shit (No one can fuck with the Wu-Tang)
Yo (What? What?), yo
Exotic type shit
Ninety-four
We must go to war fast
With the pen and the pad
Goddamn
Shine like gold rims on Pathfinders
Wu-Tang reclines, lamps
For the nine-squares, kid
(Money, clothes, designer hoes, and shows, y'all)
Check it, yo, yo
Waking up about ten, kid
Jumping in the shower, peace, about to make moves and slide like grease
What? I'm all about TECs and checks with 'nough respect
You front, I'm slamming you like the Lex
So now I'm out in the ninety-five
Rocking that "Real Niggas Don't Die"
Guess down, drawers Kani
But, yo, I'm making a pitstop
Go and buy a box of Glocks
It equaled up, pay up, what up, 'Ak?
Yo, remember that kid that we vicked?
He made a half of mil' for real
We brought about four bricks
Yo, so now we connect thoughts
Meet me at the airport
​​​Tell Golden Arms maintain the fort
Get in touch with that West Coast Cali crab you stabbed
And meet me at the bitch lab
So word up, kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit
Couldn't even rest, I need the vic'
And when I slept, I dream G's, son, I need some
Keys won't sell, call up son
I heard Pook and Tyriq caught a beef over some real shit
A fake nigga faked and they killed his clique
Give me a minute and I'm winnin'
Yo, niggas done did it
Rock your vest, keep your whip tinted
So now we see him up in Bojangles strangling a forty ounce
With ten G's worth of gold bangles
Diamonds, what? All up in his face
With his man's mace
Medallions the size of dinner plates, yo
He knew we knew him so we blew him
Took thirty G's worth of jewels off that nigga, do him
So now I'm lamping in my man's land
Streets is hot like sand
G's is rolling in my right hand
Yup, you know the steezo black
Lot'll go down like that
Shallah, cigars and mob hats
Ninety-four, takin' niggas to war, yo, yo
What do you believe in, heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven 'cause we're living in hell
What do you believe in, boy, heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven 'cause we're living in hell
So it's your life
What a chamber
Fucking with the mad strangers
Yeah, you know how it runs, baby, straight up, yo
Money, clothes, designer hoes, and shows, y'all
That's how it goes, whatever
What do you believe in, heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven 'cause we're living in hell (31st chamber, y'all)
So it's your life

Niggas ain't even know, son...
Sold their weight
No question
This shit is real, you know what I'm saying? (Word up)
Niggas think it's all about a hundred-dollar velour
A little hundred dollars and that make you a man
You ain't promised tomorrow, son, word up
Niggas don't understand how life can be so short
Come so fast
Within the blinkin' of eye
Blinkin' of eye, you're gone, baby, straight up
Know what I'm saying?
Get turned to dust
Return to the casket
And that ass is out, son, word up
Word up, get evaporated, straight up (Word up)
Lose all your strength, nigga
Crazy dedication shoutout in the memory of Two Cent Jason
Heartbroken
We soakin' wet, though
Keepin' it real for my peoples
Yeah, yo
And my physical brother DeVon
You're still in here, baby
Because you're in my arms, nigga, word up
I never let you go, baby
Know what I'm saying? You my life charm, word up
For real (Keep shinin')
For real, keepin' it real, you know
Shout out to major niggas
Big Kawai, Jess, Hell on the computer system
The RZA who slams fat discs for the ninety-four
Word up, RZA
That's my nigga, baby, yeah
Eatin' dinner with the big boys now, you know what I'm saying? (Word up)
Big Booth represent the Q
You know how we do
Now get that power-U type gangster on, you know?
The GZA, word up Masta Killa
The Abbot of the Clan
Method Man, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Bastard
U-God, word up, baby
Keep it real, son
Keep packin' them guns
Word up
