[Verse 1]
He gave me the eye
But I just passed him by
I treated him unkind
But he didn't seem to mind
I told him be on his way
But not a word did he say
He just stood there kind of bold
While I acted cold
[Chorus 1]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh, then I knew
That he won my heart
[Verse 2]
So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadn't changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away
[Chorus 2]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh, then I knew
That he won my heart
[Instrumental]
Ooh-wa!
[Verse 3]
When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Instead, he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight
[Chorus 2]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh, then I knew
That he won my heart[Outro]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Ooh, ooh
