[Verse 1]
It’s getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I’ll soon be with you, my love
To give you my dull surprise
I’ll be with you, darling, soon
I’ll be with you when the stars start falling
[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the 
sunshine of your love
[Verse 2]
I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up
[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up
[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love
