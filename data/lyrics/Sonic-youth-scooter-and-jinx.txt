My friend Goo has a real tattoo
She always knows just what to do
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care
What she does best is stand and stare

She can play the drumset too
And the boys say, "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo just says, "P-U"
My friend Goo just says, "P-U"
I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
She likes to wear green underwear
And lays down almost anywhere

She doesn't have nothing to do
And the boys say, "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo goes, "P-U"
My friend Goo just goes, "P-U"

I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
I know a secret or two about Goo
I know a secret about Goo and you

And she sticks just like glue
And the boys go, "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo just goes, "P-U"
My friend Goo just goes, "P-U"

Goo, Goo, Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
My friend Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
Talkin' 'bout Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
My friend Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
You would too
Goo
