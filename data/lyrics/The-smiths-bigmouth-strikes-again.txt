[Verse]
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed
[Bridge 1]
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (Oh)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
[Chorus]
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
[Bridge 2]
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt (Oh)
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt
[Chorus]
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh)
