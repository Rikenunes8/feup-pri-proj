People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we g-g-g-get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I don't need your fucking shit (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die because of it (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Why don't you all f-f-fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation, baby
My generation, baby

Oh, so young
