[Verse 1]
All the smiles, the things we've done
Oh and when I think that it's only just begun
Smiling faces oh not forgotten
'Cause I love you
[Verse 2]
When I think of all the things we've done
Oh darling it's just only begun
Oh smiling faces not forgotten
Because I love you
[Bridge]
Just for a little while
Oh baby, just to see you smile
Just for a little while
[Verse 1]
Oh when I think of all the things that we've done
And I believe that it's only just begun
Oh, smiling faces not forgotten
Because I love you
Oh oh oh I love you
Oh whoa oh oh I love you
