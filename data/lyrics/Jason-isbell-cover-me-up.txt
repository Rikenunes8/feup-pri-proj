[Verse 1]
A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
It can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
Days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone
[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
[Verse 2]
Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, "I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home"
But home was a dream, one I'd never seen
'Til you came along
[Chorus]
So girl, hang your dress up to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
