[Verse 1]
Said I love the lie, lie the love
Hangin' on with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
Hangin' up the whole damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut
Tryin' to make it real, but compared to what?
[Verse 2]
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children are killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
Tired old ladies are kissin' dogs
And I hate that human love for that stinking mutt
Tryin' to make it real, but compared to what?
[Verse 3]
Said the President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
You have one doubt, they call it treason
I said we're chicken feathers, all without one gut
Tryin' to make it real, but compared to what?
[Verse 4]
Go to church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Tell us what he thinks is right
But he must be in some kind of stupid nut
He tries to make it real, try to make it real, yeah
Tryin' to make it real, real, real
Tryin' to make it real, real, real, yeah
Tryin' to make it real, yeah
Real, real, real, real
Tryin' to make it real
Tryin' to make it real, yeah
[Verse 5]
But where's that bee and where's their honey?
Where's my God and where's my money?
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
And it kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut
He tried, tried, tried
Tried to make it real
Tried to make it real, yeah, but compared to what?[Verse 6]
Said I love the lie, lie the love
Hangin' on with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
Hangin' up the whole damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut
Tryin' to make it real, but compared to what?
