[Verse 1]
Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that you're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
For he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night for making slow love
The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make IT slow
Just like the wind blows
Let's make IT last forever
For a hundred times won't be enough
Tonight is the night for making slow love
[Chorus]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time
[Verse 2]
Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feeling
You've got me reeling
You can see through race car drivers
Let me show you what I'm made of
Tonight is the night for making slow love
[Chorus]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time
