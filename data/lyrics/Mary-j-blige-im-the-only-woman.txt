[Intro]
Oooh...
I'm the only woman you need
[Chorus]
I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy (Don't you be a fool)
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend
[Verse 1]
I gave my heart to you
What more can I do
To show you how much I care?
About you and all the little things you do
But see, all I ask is that you make me feel like
I'm somebody
All day, all day, every day, give your lovin' away
Whoa...
Baby, can't you see
If we should part
That all my days of loving you
You know they weren't that hard
That's why I'm saying I gotta be strong
[Chorus]
I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend
[Verse 2]
I know that I was wrong
For all that carryin' on
But are you gonna hold this against me for life?
You know all I wanted to do is be your wife
And make you happy, yeah[Chorus]
I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed (I'm the only one)
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me (I'm the only woman, baby)
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend
[Bridge]
If you really don't want me (Want me)
I wish you'd let me know
And I will go so far away
I cannot stay
If you don't want me to, I can
Be a fool for you no more (I don't think so)
You see, I tried
Tried to please you
The best way I know how
And I never deceived you
If only we could trust each other
Stop thinking foolish things
I don't want another lover, so I...
[Chorus]
I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed (I got to be strong)
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend
I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy (Don't you be a fool)
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend
