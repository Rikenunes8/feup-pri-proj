[Refrain]
They say the joint was rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stop a rocking
Till the moon went down
[Verse 1]
Oh, it sound so sweet
Gotta take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
Just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Well and clapping my hands
[Refrain]
Well the joint started rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Twelve o'clock
Well the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back
[Refrain]
But they kept on a-rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went downBut they kept on a-rocking
Going 'round and 'round

What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
But the joint kept rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
