[Pre-Chorus]
Far away
Far away child
Turn your eyes
Far away child
[Chorus]
I will sleep
Right down inside you tonight
I will sleep tonight
[Verse 1]
Pirate ships
Pirate ships child
Merry and bold
Sparkling wits child
Coming to dock
Right at your feet tonight
Coming to dock tonight
In the stars
In the stars child
See the people
In the stars Child
They will sail
Right through your window tonight
Into your window tonight[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
I will sleep
Right down inside you tonight
I will sleep tonight[x2]
