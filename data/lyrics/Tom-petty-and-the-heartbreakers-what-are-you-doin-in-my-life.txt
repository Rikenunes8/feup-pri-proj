[Verse 1]
Well, you followed me all around New York City
Trying to make people think I wanted you with me
I can only hope that they didn't believe you
I can't figure out why I got to deal with you
[Chorus]
What are you doing in my life?
What are you doing in my life?
What are you doing in my life?
I didn't ask for you
[Verse 2]
I don't know how you got my telephone number
Probably some jerk trying to put me under
Some friend of a friend of a friend of mine
Baby, who you trying to fool when you tell those lies?
[Chorus]
What are you doing in my life?
What are you doing in my life?
What are you doing in my life?
I didn't ask for you
[Bridge]
Well, this is all a little too much to believe
You're putting my name all around in the street
Honey, where did you think this was going to lead?
Baby, will you tell me what you want from me?
[Guitar Solo]
Oh!
[Bridge]
Well, this is all a little too much to believe
You're putting my name all around in the street
Honey, where did you think this was going to lead?
Baby, will you tell me what you want from me?[Verse 3]
Well, you're the last woman in the world that thrills me
Now you got my girlfriend trying to kill me
Honey, my friends think that I've gone crazy
Can't you figure out that you ain't my baby?
[Chorus]
What are you doing in my life?
What are you doing in my life?
What are you doing in my life?
I didn't ask for you
