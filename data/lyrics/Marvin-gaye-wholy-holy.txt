Wholly holy
Come together
Wholly holy
People, we all got to come together
'Cause we need the strength, power and all the feeling
Wholly holy (Oh Lord)
Get together, one another
Wholly holy, wholly holy, wholly
We should believe in one another (Believe in Jesus)
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return (Believe in)
He left us a book to believe in
In it we've got a lot to learn
Oh yeah
Wholly
(Oh Lord) We can conquer hate ('Cause we can) forever
We need him (Oh Lord)
Wholly (Wholly holy, wholly holy)
We can rock the world's foundation (Yes we can)
Everybody together, together and holy (Wholly holy, wholly)
Will holler love, love, love across the nation (Oh, oh)
Wholly holy
All together and holy (Wholly)
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oh oh, ooh ooh ooh
