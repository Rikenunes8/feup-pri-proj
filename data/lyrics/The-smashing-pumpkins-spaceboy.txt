[Verse 1]
Feel it
Break your bones
Mr. Jones
Taste me
As I bleed
Taste my need
[Hook 1]
And Spaceboy, I've missed you
Spinning round my head
And any way you choose me
You'll break instead
[Verse 2]
Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life
I don't need
I don't care
Please
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause when a lover aches
That's when a lover breaks
I want to go home
I want to go home
[Hook 2]
And Spaceboy, they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And anyway you choose me
We won't belong
[Outro]
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong[Woman talking]
