If you want to feel good
If you want to feel all right
If you want to shake your stuff
Get some rock 'n' roll tonight
Dance, 'til your shoes are hot
Dance, 'til your nerves are shot
Dance, give it all you got
Dance, dance, ready or not
If you want to shake it up
If you want to feel so cool
Get down with them girls
Get down you dancing fool
Dance, 'til your bones are tired
Dance, 'til you feel inspired
Dance, get your hormones fired
Dance, dance, we're dancing wired
You're jiving, feeling right
You're diving in the crowd
You're dancing 'til you drop
Rock 'n' roll music's good and loud
Dance, you liked your score
Dance, what you're looking for
Dance, if you're rich or poor
Dance, dance, can't take no more
