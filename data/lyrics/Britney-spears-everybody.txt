[Intro: Annie Lennox]
Everybody
Everybody's looking for something
[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I'm ferocious
When I see you instantly
So precocious
Assuming that you're into me
So fierce, the way you pierce me with your energy
My heart's on fire
Boy, come on and rescue me
[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
When I see you, I need you right away 
(Taking me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving
It's got a hold of me
Grabbing me, rapidly
Romantic dancing
Dreams are made of this, yeah
[Chorus: 
Britney Spears
]
Everybody, come on get to jumping
Everybody, moving next to something
Everybody, feel the temperature rising
Everybody, come on let's keep grinding
[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
It's so real to feel you standing next to me
So intense when your scent's in my vicinity
Body shaking, aching, I can't take it
How I want you so bad, boy, that I can taste it now
[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
When I see you, I need you right away 
(Taking me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving
It's got a hold of me
Grabbing me, rapidly
Romantic dancing
Dreams are made of this, yeah[Chorus: 
Britney Spears
]
Everybody, come on get to jumping
Everybody, moving next to something
Everybody, feel the temperature rising
Everybody, come on let's keep grinding
[Bridge: Britney Spears]
Fellas get wild, start flashing your money
Ladies go crazy and act a fool
Everybody get down and do what you want to
The night is still young to be seduced
Taking in every little thing I see
Triple tie dancing with the tab complete
Little boys dancing 'cause they feeling me
Sweating cold, fretting, it's the place to be
Come and sit with me, come and sit with me
Sit back, you'll see it so beautifully
Lovin' everybody, baby, is all you need
Let go of the way things used to be
[Chorus: 
Britney Spears
]
Everybody, come on get to jumping (everybody)
Everybody, moving next to something (move your body)
Everybody, feel the temperature rising (ooh)
Everybody, come on let's keep grinding
Everybody, come on get to jumping (let your body move, ohh)
Everybody, moving next to something
Everybody, feel the temperature rising
Everybody, come on let's keep grinding[Outro: Britney Spears and 
Annie Lennox
]
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody's looking for something, everybody
Everybody
Everybody's looking for something
