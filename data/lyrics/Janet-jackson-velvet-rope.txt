[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
[Spoken: Janet Jackson]
We all wanna feel special
[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
This special need that's within us
Brings out the best, yet worst in us
Follow the passion that's within you
Living the truth will set you free
[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong (To feel we, to feel we)
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
Put others down to fill us up
Oppressing me will oppress you
Outside, leave judgment, outside, leave hate
One love's the answer you'll find in you
[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong (Belong, belong)
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope[Violin Solo: Vanessa-Mae]
[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
