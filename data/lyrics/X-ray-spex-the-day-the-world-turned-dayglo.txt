I clambered over mounds and mounds
Of polystyrene foam
And fell into a swimming pool
Filled with fairy snow

And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
I wrenched the nylon curtains back
As far as they would go
And peered through Perspex window panes
At the acrylic road

And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh

I drove my polypropolene
Car on wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a Wimpy bar
To have a rubber bun

And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh


The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh

The X-rays were penetrating
Through the latex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves
Fell from the rayon trees

The day the world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
