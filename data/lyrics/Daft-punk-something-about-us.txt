[Verse 1]
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway
[Verse 2]
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you
[Refrain]
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
