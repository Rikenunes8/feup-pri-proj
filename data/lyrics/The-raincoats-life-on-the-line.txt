A feeling of being followed
A feeling of being watched
Isn't easy to define
So I won't trouble you
She put her life on the line
She kept trying
Trying to find
A place to hide
Somewhere inside
Somewhere where the air was hot
And her blood could rush
But she could not
Her logic was too tangled
I couldn't untangle it
How can silence or expression
Stop or start here for anyone
She kept trying
Trying to find
A place to hide
Somewhere inside
Somewhere where the air was hot
And her blood could rush
But she could not
She's got her back to the wall
Some are gone but we're still here
This train is arriving
Steel wheels
She wants to feel
She kept trying
Trying to find
A place to hide
Somewhere inside
Somewhere where the air was hot
And her blood could rush
But she could notBut she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
