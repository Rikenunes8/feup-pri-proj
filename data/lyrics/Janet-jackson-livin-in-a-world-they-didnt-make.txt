[Verse 1]
Children are called the future of an adult world
They are born with spirits so innocent
'Til we teach them how to hate
Add to the world's confusion
We teach our kids rules
That we don't adhere to ourselves
Right or wrong
What examples can they take?
The people we learn from
Forge the ideas we become
[Chorus]
Livin' in a world they didn't make
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules
(And they're just)
Livin' in a world they didn't make
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes
How much of this madness can they take, our children?
[Verse 2]
Children grow to become our young adults
Problems of the world
They must learn how to confront
Doin' drugs, joinin' gangs to rebel
Colors show they belong
To the social override
'Cause they're livin' in a space
They feel out of place[Chorus]
Livin' in a world they didn't make
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules
(And they're just)
Livin' in a world they didn't make
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes
How much of this madness can they take, our children?
(How much can they take?)
Livin' in a world they didn't make (They did not make)
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate (That's filled with hate)
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules (They're just)
Livin' in a world they didn't make (Livin' in a world)
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes (Livin' in a world)
How much of this madness can they take, our children? (Livin' in a world)
[Outro]
How much can they take?
Children of the world
They are born so innocent
How much can they take?
Save the babies
Save the babies
[Spoken Outro to Fade]
This just in, at least five people are dead, and thirty others wounded, after a gunman opened fire at a California school playground, and then killed himself. Apparently, the gunman, armed with an automatic rifle, shot the kids' door...
