In the morning, well in the morning
Hang my head and I cry
Well in the morning, oh in the morning
Well when you're gone, ain't going to worry mine no more
Well 'til the morning, tell me true
Will tell my way of acting, blow in somebody new
Now, in the morning, well 'til the morning, tell me true
Well when you're gone, ain't going to worry mine no more
Well one of these mornings, and lord it won't be long
Look for your daddy and your daddy will be gone
I won't come back no more, back no more
Gonna look for your daddy, but down the road I go
