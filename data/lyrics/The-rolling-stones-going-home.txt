[Verse 1]
Spending too much time away
I can't stand another day
Maybe you'd think I've seen the world
But I'd rather see my girl
[Chorus]
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home, bom, bom, bom, b-bom
Home, bom, bom, bom, back home
Yes I am
[Verse 2]
All those letters every day
May be all right in their way
But I'd love to see your face
When I get home in their place
[Chorus]
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home, bom, bom, bom, b-bom
Home, bom, bom, bom, back home
Yes I am
All right
[Chorus]
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going homeI'm going home, bom, bom, bom, b-bom
Home, bom, bom, bom, back home
Yes I will
[Verse 3]
When you're 3000 miles away
I just never sleep the same
If I packed my things right now
I could be home in seven hours
[Chorus]
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home, bom, bom, bom, b-bom
Home, bom, bom, bom, back home
Yes I will
[Ad-lib]
Yes I will
See my baby
See my baby
I want to see my girl
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
I just can't waitI just can't wait
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
I just can't wait, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just can't wait
See my baby
She'll make me feel all right
My, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, ha...
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
See my baby
She'll make me feel so good
She'll make me feel all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
Yes she does, in the middle of the night
So good, so good, so good, so good, so tough, so tough, so ta-ta-ta-ta...
I feel all right
Feel all right
Come on, baby
I'm going to get home

Get home, honey, get home
Shhhucks

Cha, cha, my baby
I'm looking for my baby
Going to go in the early morning, baby
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Going to catch that plane
I'm going to catch that plane
Now it won't be long, I said, listen to me
It won't be long, no, no
No, it won't be long, baby
It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long, long, long
A long, long time since I've seen my baby
Yes it is
It's such a, such a, such a, such a, such a, such a long, long time
Long, long time
Long, long time
Long, long time
Long, long, long, long time
Yes it is
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
I feel all right
I'm going to see my baby one more time
Get home, get home, get home
Get, get home
I got to, I got to get home, baby
I want to see my darling, I want to make sweet, sweet love
Ah sweet, sweet love
Ah sweet, sweet love
Ah sweet, sweet, ah sweet love to you, baby
In the middle of the night
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Oh, in the midnight hour
She'll make me feel so good
She'll make me feel all right
She make me feel so good
So good
So good
When she touch my hand
That's all I got to say
'Cause I'm going to pack my bags
Ah la la la
Sha la la la
Sha la la
Ah come on
I want to see you, baby
See your face
See your face
Your pretty little smile
Your pretty little smile
Your pretty little smile
Your pretty little smile
Your pretty little smile
Your pretty clothes
Hear you talk
Hear you talk
Hear you talk
Hear you talk
Hear you talk
Come on
Come on

Ah come on
I'll see my baby
I'm going home

I'm going home
I'm gonna get out
I'm getting out
I'm getting out
Getting out
Getting out...
I feel so good seeing your face
Making love to you, baby
Yes it makes me feel so good
Inside, inside, inside
I feel so good inside
Feel so good inside
I feel so good inside
Come on, touch me one more time
Touch me one more time
Touch me one more time
Touch me one more, one more
Come on, little girl, you may look sweet
You may look sweet
But I know you ain't
But I know you ain't
But I know you ain't
