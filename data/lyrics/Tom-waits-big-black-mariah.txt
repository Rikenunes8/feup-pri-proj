Cuttin' through the cane break
, 
rattling the sill
Thunder that the rain makes when the shadow tops the hill
Big light on the back street hill to Evermore
Packin' down the ladder 
with the hammer to the floor
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Well he's all boxed up 
on a red belle dame
Hunted Black Johnny with a blind man's cane
A yellow bullet
 with a rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger
 get an old bell, Jim
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Sent to the skies on a Benny Jag Blue
Off to bed without his supper 
like the Linda brides do
Now he's got to do the story with the old widow Jones
He's got a wooden coat, this boy is never coming home
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Cut through the cane break...
Well he's all boxed up on a red belle dame
Fat Blue Johnny
 on a blind man's cane
A hundred yellow bullets shook a rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger on a pair of new wings
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
