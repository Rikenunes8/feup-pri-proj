[Verse 1]
Kiss
Your fear
Your red button
Falls from my mouth
Slip
Your dress
Over your head
It's been so long
[Refrain]
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
[Verse 2]
Move
On top
Because that way
You touch her, too
Turn
Your head
Come back again
To here knows when
[Refrain]
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
[Instrumental Outro]
