Lookin' at the devil
Grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin'
I begin to run
Ooh, bullets start chasin'
I begin to stop
We begin to tussle
I was on the top
Hey, hey
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
I wanna thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Stiff all in the collar
Fluffy in the face
Chitchat chatter tryin'
Stuffy in the place
I wanna thank you for the party
I could never stay (I could never stay)
Many thangs is on my mind (Many thangs on my mind)
Words in the way
Hey, hey, hey
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin, ooh, yeah
I wanna thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Hey, yeah
Dance to the music
All night long (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday people
Gonna try to sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama start to cry
Papa still singin' (Papa still singin')
You can make it if you try
You can make it, you can make it, hey
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Yeah, yeahFlamin' eyes of people fear
Burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much
Hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Dig it for a starter
Dyin' young is hard to take
Sellin' out is harder
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
I wanna thank you falettinme be mice elf agin (I went back again, again)
I wanna thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
