There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And as we talked of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is just to love
And be loved in return
