[Verse 1]
Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car
Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car
I want to just show you
What my politics are
[Verse 2]
I'm a political man
And I practice what I preach
I'm a political man
And I practice what I preach
So don't deny me, baby
Not while you're in my reach
[Verse 3]
I support the left
Though I'm leaning, leaning to the right
I support the left
Though I'm leaning to the right
But I'm just not there
When it's coming to a fight
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car
Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car
I want to just show you
What my politics are
