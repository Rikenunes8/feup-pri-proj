[Verse]
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it home again
It's so far and out of sight
I really need someone to talk to, and nobody else
Knows how to comfort me tonight
[Chorus]
Snow is cold, rain is wet
Chills my soul right to the marrow
I won't be happy 'til I see you alone again
'Til I'm home again and feeling right
[Chorus]
Snow is cold, rain is wet
Chills my soul right to the marrow
I won't be happy 'til I see you alone again
'Til I'm home again and feeling right
'Til I'm home again and feeling right
I wanna be home again and feeling right
