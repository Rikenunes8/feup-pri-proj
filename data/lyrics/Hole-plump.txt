[Verse 1]
Shakes his death rattle
Spittle on his bib
And I don't do the dishes
I throw them in the crib
[Chorus]
I'm eating you
I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick
[Verse 2]
Now I've stumbled here
Failed to make it mine
They say I'm plump
But I threw up all the time
[Chorus]
I'm eating you
I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick
[Bridge]
Do you fake it for me like I?
Do you fake it for me like I?
Do you fake it for me like I?
[Verse 3]
My baby's in her arms
Crawling up her legs
Like a liar at a witch trial
You look good for your age
[Chorus]
I'm eating you
I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick
