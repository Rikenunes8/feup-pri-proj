[Chorus]
You wouldn't know me if you saw me here
Wake up at your front door no more
You'll never know me by askin' how I been
You'll never keep up that way
[Verse 1]
Stop sign, stop sign
That's all she threw at me
'Til I don't feel like home no more
Wings on fire, I caught outside of a brand new home
Buried in your heels
[Chorus]
I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
Wake up at your front door no more
You'll never know me by askin' how I been
You'll never keep up that way
That's what I say
[Verse 2]
Bad news is better than what you've been handing me
What's gone wrong with you, my friend?
Promise me, promise me
Don't ask that of me now
Won't you just send me some word?
[Chorus]
I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
I'm changing day to day, that's right
You'll never know me by askin' how I been
You'll never keep up that way
That's what I say
[Chorus]
I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
I'm changing day to day, that's right
You'll never know me by askin' how I been
You'll never keep up that way[Outro]
Well, you wouldn't know me
You wouldn't know me
