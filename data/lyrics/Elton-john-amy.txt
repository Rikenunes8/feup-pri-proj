[Verse 1]
Tread on my face if you like, little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to, baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy
[Verse 2]
You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my head 'cause I, I love you all the same
[Chorus]
Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy
[Electric Violin Solo]
[Chorus]
Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy
[Verse 3]
I'm beaten on the streets because I loves you
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle, you see
[Outro]
Amy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreamsAmy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams
