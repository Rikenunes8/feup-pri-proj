[Verse 1]
My name is Jonas
, I'm carryin' the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel
Come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea
Just like Grandma made when we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then, once but never again
We've all left the den, let me tell you about it
[Chorus 1]
The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket cost only your mind
The driver said, "Hey man, we go all the way"
Of course we were willing to pay
[Verse 2]
My name is Wepeel, got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries, but they're still making noise, making noise
Tell me what to do, now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat, and you know what else?
Guess what I received in the mail today
Words of deep concern from my little brother
[Chorus 2]
The building's not goin' as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math
[Bridge 1]
The workers are going home, the workers are going home
The workers are going home, the workers are going home, yeah
[Bridge 2]
The workers are going home, the workers are going home
The workers are going home, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
My name is Jonas
