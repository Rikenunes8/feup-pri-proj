[Intro]
(Nothing's gonna stop us)
(We can't be stopped)
[Verse 1]
I know that it's not been easy tryin' to make it in this crazy world
The people 'round you try to stop you
Stomp you, sayin' that you don't belong
[Chorus]
You must remember that (You must remember)
You were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped (Can't be stopped)
Stay strong, my sister, you can't be stopped
(You have to stay strong, my sister)
No, you can't be stopped (My sister, you can't be stopped)
[Verse 2]
I know that sometimes you get to feelin' I've given up on you
The pressure seems to, to defeat you
Beat you whenever you can't go on
[Chorus]
You must remember that (You must remember)
You were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped (Can't be stopped)
Stand tall, my brother
You can't be stopped (Stand tall, my brother)
No, you can't be stopped (Can't be stopped)[Interlude]
(Don't ever let nobody tell you you ain't strong enough)
[Post-Chorus]
Strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you you ain't strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you
You know that I will be right here to
Remind you that we need togetherness
'Cause the long ride has not forgot you
Don't forget where you come from
[Chorus]
You must remember that (You must remember)
You were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped (Blood of kings and queens)
Stay strong, my sister (Stay strong, my sister)
You can't be stopped (Sister, stay strong)
No, you can't be stopped (You can't be stopped, my sister)
You must remember that (You must)
You were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped (Can't be stopped)
Stand tall, my brother
You can't be stopped (Stand tall, my brother)
No, you can't be stopped (No, you can't be stopped)[Post-Chorus]
Strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you you ain't strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you you ain't—
Strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you you ain't strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you you ain't—
Strong enough
Don't let nobody tell you you ain't strong enough
