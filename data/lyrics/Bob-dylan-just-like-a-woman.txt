[Verse 1]
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as 
I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see 
her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
[Chorus]
She takes 
just like a woman
, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
[Verse 2]
Queen Mary
, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls
[Chorus]
She takes 
just like a woman
, yes
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
[Bridge]
Yeah, it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
[Verse 3]
Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world[Chorus]
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But ya' break just like a little girl
[Instrumental]
