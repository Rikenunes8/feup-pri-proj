Mamma been laid off
Pappa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
They gotta listen to the blues
Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues
Pappa been laid off
Mamma been laid off
Billy can't get a job
For too long, too long
Don't let them lose
We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home
And listen to the blues
There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain

And the ghetto's all around
All over, my friend
Have you ever seen a man break down?
Do you know how, how that feels?
To walk the streets
With your head held high
Oh Lord, have mercy
Did you ever see a man break down?
There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain
Ooh, did you ever see a man break down?
