Go to her
She waits
She lies
Beating for you
Go to her
She waits
She lies
Screaming for you
I never thought I'd see the day
When the shadow would move up and say
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Go to her
She waits
She lies
Longing for you
Go to her
She waits
She lies
Only for youThere's something in my bed
So help me lord I'm afraid
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
[Solo Grace Slick]
I can still remember the day
When he first won my heart
On a hillside where we lay
He said we would never part
So help how was I to know
My leaving would hurt her so
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Help how was I to know
My leaving would hurt her soGo to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Help how was I to know
My leaving would hurt her so
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Go to her
She lay
Waiting for you
Go to her
She waits
She lies
Beating for you
Go to her
She waits
She lies
Screaming for youGo to her
She waits
She lies
All for you
Go to her
She lay
Dying for you
Go to her
She lay
Crying for you
Go to her
Go to her
