[Verse 1]
And when I work hard all day long
I tell you what, it don't bother me nohow
Because how could anything ever go wrong
[Chorus]
When I got my baby, Lord, yes
When I got my baby, oh Lord!
[Verse 2]
And when they tell me love is pain
I said it might be true for you, honey
But not for Janis no more, no no no no
All I've ever got to do is call my daddy's name
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Honey, I want to tell you something that I do
Deep down, honey, in the dark of the night
When I lay my head down, I want to go to sleep
And I know everything is going to be alright
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
And when I want to call the names
Or the things to be that want to be to you
And when I want to reach out my hand
It always seems you hold me, dear
Love, don't you know how long I looked for you
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Love, don't you know how hard I tried
[Chorus]
