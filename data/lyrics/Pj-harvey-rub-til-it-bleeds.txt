[Verse 1]
Speak, I'm listening
Baby, I'm your sweet thing
Believe what I'm saying
God's truth, I'm not lying
[Verse 2]
I lie steady
Rest your head on me
I'll smooth it nicely
Rub it better 'til it bleeds
[Chorus]
And you believed me
Caught out again
I'm calling you weak
Getting even
[Verse 3]
And I, I was joking
Sweet babe, let me stroke it
Take, I give in
God's truth, I'm not lying
[Chorus]
And you believed me
I, I, I'm calling you weak
And I'll make it better
I'll rub 'til it bleeds
[Outro]
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it, hey!
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it unit it, hey!
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
