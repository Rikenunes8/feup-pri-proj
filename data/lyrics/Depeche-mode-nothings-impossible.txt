[Verse 1]
Just give me a reason, some kind of sign
I'll need a miracle to help me this time
I heard what you said, and I feel the same
I know in my heart that I'll have to change
[Chorus]
Even the stars look brighter tonight
Nothing's impossible
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothing's impossible
[Verse 2]
How did we get to be this far apart?
How did we get to be this far apart?
I want to be with you, something to share
I want to be near you, sometimes I care
[Chorus]
Even the stars look brighter tonight
Nothing's impossible
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothing's impossible
Even the stars look brighter tonight
Nothing's impossible
If you believe in love at first sight
Nothing's impossible
[Interlude]
[Outro]
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothing's impossible
