[Verse 1]
You're the one that I adore, you
Give me one and donâ€™t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put my fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Well, obviously, I do
That's why I want to be
[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
[Verse 2]
You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-noh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't past the way I do
Because I want to be
[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
Babe, alright
Ahh, ahh
Oh yeah[Verse 3]
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start, try to make sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be
[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
(Free like the wind blows)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(An' I'll take my time, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
(Free like the wind)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Ooh, my, my, mine)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
Free, free like the wind blows
(You'll be free, now)
(I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I just want to be free)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go - ooh!)
I've got to be free, free, free, free
