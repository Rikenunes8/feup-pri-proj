[Chorus]
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
Now the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
[Verse 1]
We all make it out like we own this whole world
While the leaders of nations they're acting like big girls
With no thoughts for their god who provides us with all
But when death comes to claim them
Who will stand and who will fall?
[Chorus]
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
Yes the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
[Verse 2]
We all move around with objectives in mind
To become rich or famous with our reputations signed
But the few that can reach to this coveted slot
Don't escape old age creeping through their bodies like a rot
[Chorus]
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
Yes the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
And the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
