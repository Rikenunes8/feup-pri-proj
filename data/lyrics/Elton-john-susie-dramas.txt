[Verse 1]
I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side
[Chorus]
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
[Verse 2]
I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls, she's a dancer, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side
[Chorus]
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time, oh
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
