[Verse 1: John Entwistle]
On top of the sky is a place where you go
If you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground is a place where you go
If you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy
[Chorus: John Entwistle, Roger Daltrey]
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die?
Never die
[Verse 2: John Entwistle]
In the place up above you grow feather wings
And you fly 'round and 'round
With a harp singing hymns
And down in the ground you grow horns and a tail and you carry a fork
And moan and wail
[Chorus: John Entwistle, Roger Daltrey]
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die?
Never die
[Bridge: Roger Daltrey]
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven and Hell
I said Heaven, Heaven and Hell, baby, yeah
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven and Hell
[Verse 3: John Entwistle & Roger Daltrey]
On top of the sky is a place where you go
If you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground is a place where you go
If you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy
[Chorus: John Entwistle & Roger Daltrey]
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die?
Never die
Never die
