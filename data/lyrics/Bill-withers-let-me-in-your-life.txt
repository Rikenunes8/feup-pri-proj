[Intro]
La, lala, lala
[Verse 1]
I only want to love you
Please don't push me away
Let me in your life
I wasn't there when he hurt you
So why should I have to pay?
Let me in your life
[Bridge]
I want to share your tomorrow
So I must beg you today
If he's the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that he's gone away
[Verse 2]
I need someone, let me love you
Please don't push me away
Let me in your life
[Outro]
La, lala, lala
La, lala, lala
