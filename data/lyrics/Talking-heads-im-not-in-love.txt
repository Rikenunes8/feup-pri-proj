[Intro]
Okay!
[Verse 1]
Pretty!
What is brand new? It's not what I think of you
You'll touch me in a minute, but that's not what I want to do
We are two strangers, we might never have met
We can talk forever, I understand what you said
[Chorus]
But I'm not in love
What does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love?
[Verse 2]
You know it!
Is there time for this? Is this responsibility?
Girl time, boy time, is that the difference between you and me?
I won't ask any questions, who needs to make a new start?
I choose to believe you, I said before that I can't
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not in love
What does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love?
[Verse 3]
Feelings!
Take it easy, baby, don't let your feelings get in the way
I believe someday we'll live in a world without love
I can answer your questions if you won't twist what I say
Please respect my opinions, they will be respected some day
[Chorus]
But I don't need love
There'll come a day when we won't need love
I believe that we don't need love
