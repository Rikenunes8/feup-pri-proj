[Verse 1: Shara Nelson]
I know that I've imagined love before
And how it could be with you
[Chorus: Shara Nelson]
Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more
[Verse 2: Shara Nelson]
The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching
[Chorus: Shara Nelson]
Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more
[Verse 3: Shara Nelson]
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
[Outro: ?]
I don't know where this one came from
I don't know where this one came from
I don't know where this, I don't know where this
I don't know where this, I don't know where this
I don't know where this one came from
