It's so obvious, it's here, it's there
It's not just the color, it must be more
At least 17 plus 3 score, this is 77
Nearly heaven, it's black, white and pink
Just think, there's more to come
Hum hum hum hum, it's so obvious
Well it's alright, listen, can't wait for 78
God, those RPM, can't wait for them
Don't just watch, hours happen
Get in there, kid and snap them
