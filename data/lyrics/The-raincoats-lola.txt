I met her in a club down in Old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola
C-O-L-A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
I’m not the world’s most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she almost broke my spine
Oh my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well I’m not dumb but I can’t understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won’t you come home with me
Well I’m not the world’s most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I went down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at meThat’s the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It’s a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well I left home just a week before
And I’d never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "Little boy I’m gonna make you a man"
Well I’m not the world’s most masculine man
But I know what I am and I’m glad I’m a man
And so is Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
