[Intro]
La-dee-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-lalala-la-la-lala
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine)
[Chorus]
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see
(My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine)
[Verse 1]
Life can be only what you make it
When you're feeling down, you should never fake it
Say what's on your mind and you'll find in time
That all the negative energy, it would all decease
And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above, yeah
Because He'll give you love
Oh, oh, ooh ooh ooh, if you looked into my life
(My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine)
[Chorus]
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Oh, you will see I'm so blue)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see
(Down and out, crying every day, don't know what to do or to say)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see
(If you looked into my life)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Mmm)
[Verse 2]
Take your time, baby, don't you rush a thing
Don't you know I know we all are struggling
I know it is hard, but we will get by
And if you don't believe in me, just believe in He, yeah
'Cause He'll give you peace of mind (Yes, He would)
And you'll see the sunshine (For real, yes, you would)
And you'll get to free your mind
And things will turn out fine
Oh, I know that things will turn out fine
Yes, they would, yes they would, ay
(My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine)[Chorus]
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Oh, oh)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Mmm-hmm)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see
(All you got to do is)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (Take your time, one day at a time
It's all on you, what you gonna do?)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
If you looked at my life
And see what I see (La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah)
(My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine)
