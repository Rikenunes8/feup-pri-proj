Sometimes I can't help but worship you
I love you and all the things that you do
I thought I'd sit and write this song just for you
To let you know that I am thinking of you
[Chorus]
When I come home so cold at night
You'll have the fireplace burning bright
Thoughts of how it's going to be
And how I'll spend those cold, cold nights warm by you
And in these autumn days
I wander through the leaves
Thinking of those winter nights
I'll spend with you
[Chorus]
