[Verse 1]
Oh, you sad one
Playing the angel
Isn't so easy where you're from
Oh, you wild one
Devil's companion
You won't stay satisfied for long
[Chorus]
I don't want you to change
Anything you do
I don't want you to be
Someone else for me
[Verse 2]
Oh, you dark one
Eternal outsider
Caught in the spider's web you've spun
Oh, you blind one
Gentle and kind one
Seeing the world as a loaded gun
[Chorus]
I don't want you to change
Anything you do
I don't want you to be
Someone else for me
[Outro]
Stay as you are
The darkest star
Shining for me
Majestically
