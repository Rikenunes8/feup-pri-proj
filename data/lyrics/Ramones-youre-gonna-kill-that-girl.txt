[Intro]
I saw her walking down the street
He jumped down, he knocked her off her feet
And then I knew, it was the end of her
One, two, three, four!
[Chorus 1]
He’s gonna kill that girl
He’s gonna kill that girl
He’s gonna kill that girl
Tonight, tonight
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Tonight, tonight
[Verse 1]
When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted just a little bit more
[Chorus 2]
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Tonight, tonight
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Tonight, tonight
[Verse 2]
When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted just a little bit more[Bridge]
I saw her walking down the street
He jumped down, he knocked her off her feet
And then I knew, it was the end of her
One, two, three, four!
[Chorus 2]
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Tonight, tonight
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Hey, he’s gonna kill that girl
Tonight, tonight
[Verse 2]
When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted just a little bit more
