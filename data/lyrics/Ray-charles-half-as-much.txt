[Verse]
Well, if you loved me half as much as I, I love you
Uh, you couldn't worry me half as much as you do
Woah, you're so nice to me when there's no one else around
But you only build me up to tear me down
Oh, but if you missed me half as much as I, I miss you
Well, you couldn't stay away half as much as you do
Woah, I know that I could never be this blue
Well, if you only loved me half as much as I love you
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
I know that I, I know that I could never be this blue
Woah, if you only loved me half as much as I love you
Well, as I love you
Oh, as I love you
Oh, what did I say?
Mm
