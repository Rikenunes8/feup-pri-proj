[Verse 1]
We walked along the beach, what a moonlit night
He held my hands in his, he kissed me, and he said
"I wanna spend my life with you, I want you for my wife"
Just then, I thought
[Chorus]
What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
[Verse 2]
I took a pause, then a deep sigh
He looked right into my eyes, as he said
"I know I didn't say somethin' wrong"
I didn't have the courage to say, but then, I thought
[Chorus]
What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you hit my face?
What about the times you kept on when I said: "No more, please"
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you were ashamed me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head, uh
What about that, what about that?
[Bridge]
Don't wanna live my life in misery
Don't tell me you did it 'cause you love me
I don't believe, I'm sick and tired of your deceptive games
Wonder where you have been, I can't live life wonderin'[Verse 3]
My heart was poundin', but the time had come
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
Yeah, and tellin' my screamin' mind what to do (Yeah)
I looked him straight in the eyes and then I said
[Chorus]
What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you hit my face?
What about the times you kept on when I said
"No more, please"
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you were ashamed me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head (Oh)
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me? (I remember)
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that? (Oh)
What about the times you yelled at me? (I remember)
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me (You wouldn't even hold me)
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you shamed me?
What about the times you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head, uh
What about that, what about that?
