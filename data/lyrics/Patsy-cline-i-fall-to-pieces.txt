[Chorus 1]
I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?
[Verse 1]
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
[Chorus 2]
I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame
[Verse 2]
You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me, too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces[x2]
