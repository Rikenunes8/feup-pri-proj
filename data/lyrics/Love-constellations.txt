I've got scars up and down from my head to my toes
I've lived a long hard life, some said, and it shows
From the fist fights, late nights, rock and roll shows
You've got to take it to the limit 'cause nobody knows
If it's your time don't cry, and never regret
Stick the dagger in deep, and twist it again
And love will leave you broken hearted with a hole in your chest
Like you've been shot-gunned down and left for dead
If you really wanna live
You've gotta be ready to die
Every single love is a murder
You've gotta commit to survive
If you really wanna live
You've gotta be ready to die
Every single love is a murder
You've gotta commit to survive
With life comes pain, but pain comes love
And when you feel it you can heal it, let it murder your heart
And there's a poison at the end of every arrow that falls
Gotta get knocked off of your feet and crawl
Through the thorns and the glass along your path
Feel the wrath of the reaper, he will kid you and laugh
And when it's all over, with a smile on your face
Wipe the blood from your wounds and give it a taste
If you really wanna live
You've gotta be ready to die
Every single love is a murder
You've gotta commit to survive
If you really wanna live
You've gotta be ready to die
Every single love is a murder
You've gotta commit to survive
It's a tragedy that truly hurts
I'll do you, if you do me first
Isn't that suicide?
But I don't know if you will die
But even in death I can't forget you
Even in death I'm glad I met you
You made life worth living
And you made love worth giving
So don't panic
I'm a helpless romantic
So I'm a dead man often
And this is a dead man talkin'
If you really wanna live
You've gotta be ready to die
Every single love is a murder
You've gotta commit to survive
If you really wanna live
You've gotta be ready to die
Every single love is a murder
You've gotta commit to survive
