[Intro]
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay?
[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I don't wanna change you now
I wanna know how you been making out
How you been?
Did the morning sun warm your soul?
Did he make you happy? Did he make you whole?
Hey
[Chorus]
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay?
[Verse 2]
Hey girl, since you been away with him
My life has been cloudy and days been awful dim
But you're looking well
Baby, would you rather be there with him?
Would you reconsider and come running back to me?
[Chorus]
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay?
[Break]
[Chorus]
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay? (I just want to know)
Have you been making out okay?
[Outro]
Hey baby, stopped by just to say
While I was on my way
Stopped by today just to see how you was getting along
I wanna know, can you make it on your own, baby?
On your own, baby
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay? (Won't you tell me, tell me?)
Have you been making out okay?
