[Verse]
Well I know if it hits you
You'll say, oh yes you will now
I wanna tell you it's gonna get you
Yes indeed, oh yea
You get a feeling down in your soul
Every time you hear that good old rock and roll
I know you say oh whoa
I just wanna tell you if it's in you
You'll say, oh yes you will
I wanna tell you it's gonna sin you
Yes indeed, oh yea
Every time you hear that rock and roll beat
You get a feeling from your head down to your feet
I now you say oh oh right now
I know you'll dance all over the floor
Yes indeed, oh yes you will now
You will be jumpin' till they close the door
Yes indeed, oh yea
Every time you hear a swinging band
Jump up and down, oh, and clap your hand
I know you say oh oh oh, yes indeed
