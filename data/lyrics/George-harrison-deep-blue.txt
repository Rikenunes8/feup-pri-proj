[Verse 1]
When sunshine is not enough to make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the roadside
Of one long lifetime
[Chorus]
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
[Verse 2]
When you stand there, watch tired bodies
Full of sickness and pain
To show you just how helpless you really are
When you get down to the truth it hurts me
[Chorus]
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
[Instrumental Verse]
[Chorus]
Got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
[Verse 3]
When I think of the life I'm living
Pray God help me, give me your light
So I can love you and understand this repetition
That keeps me here feeling deep blue
[Chorus]
You know I'm deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
[Verse 4]
When sunshine is not enough to make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the roadside
Of one long lifetime[Outro]
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
