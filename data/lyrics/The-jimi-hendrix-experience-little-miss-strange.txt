[Verse 1]
No one knows where she comes from
Maybe she's a devil in disguise
I can tell by looking in her eyes
[Chorus]
Little miss strange
Little miss strange
[Verse 2]
Little miss strange came into my parlor
I don't know just what to ask her
I don't remember what we did after
[Chorus]
Little miss strange
Little miss strange
[Instrumental break 0:57-1:45]
[Verse 3]
Little miss strange came out of the darkness
Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light
I'm talking about the dream I had the other night
[Outro]
Little miss strange
Little miss strange
