When I'm alone I think about you all the time
Magnet your photo to the fridge as I crush ice
I can't recall a single thing you said
Too busy trying to guess what's in your head
Oh baby, I'll buy
Lemons and limes
She said
"I won't ever
Say no, never"
Why can't you hear me?
Why can't I hear you too?
Headless horse dragging my bones through the minefield
Do not interrupt, it's a process
Do not interrupt, it's a process
Do not interrupt, it's a process
Do not interrupt, it's a process
Do not interrupt while it's processing
Oh baby, I'll buy
Lemons and limes
She said
Why can't you hear me?
Why can't I hear you too?
Headless horse dragging my bones through the minefield
