[Verse 1]
None of these boys can dance
Not a single one of dem stand a chance
All of dem girls a mess
I've seen it all before, I'm not impressed
None of dem get my sex
None of dem move my intellect
None of dem work for me
None of dem make me feel anything
[Pre-Chorus]
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
[Chorus]
I'm so bored in this town
Take me away from here
Play me some kind of new sound
Something true and sincere
I've got a little girl
Singing on repeat in my head, oh
Take me far away from here
[Verse 2]
None of dem get my stance
None of dem do it like I can
None of these chicks got style
None of these drugs get me high
None of these beats are raw
None of these beats ever break the law
None of dem kicks go boom
None of dem bass lines fill the room
[Pre-Chorus]
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate[Chorus]
I'm so bored in this town
Take me away from here
Play me some kind of new sound
Something true and sincere
I've got a little girl
Singing on repeat in my head, oh
Take me far away from here
I'm so bored in this town
Take me away from here
Play me some kind of new sound
Something true and sincere
I've got a little girl
Singing on repeat in my head, oh
Take me far away from here
[Pre-Chorus]
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
Step on it, step on it
I will accelerate
