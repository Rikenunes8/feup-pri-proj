[Intro]
[Verse 1]
I am the voice inside your head (And I control you)
I am the lover in your bed (And I control you)
I am the sex that you provide (And I control you)
I am the hate you try to hide (And I control you)
[Chorus]
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down, I use you up
Mr. Self Destruct
[Verse 2]
I speak religion's message clear (And I control you)
I am denial, guilt and fear (And I control you)
I am the prayers of the naive (And I control you)
I am the lie that you believe (And I control you)
[Chorus]
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down, I use you up
Mr. Self Destruct
[Bridge 1]
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
You let me do this to you (I am an exit)
[Bridge 2]
I am the needle in the vein
I am the high you can't sustain
I am the pusher, I'm a whore
I am the need in you for more[Verse 3]
I am the bullet in the gun (And I control you)
I am the truth from which you run (And I control you)
I am the silencing machine (And I control you)
I am the end of all your dreams (And I control you)
[Chorus]
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down, I use you up
Mr. Self Destruct
I take you where you want to go
I give you all you need to know
I drag you down, I use you up
Mr. Self Destruct
