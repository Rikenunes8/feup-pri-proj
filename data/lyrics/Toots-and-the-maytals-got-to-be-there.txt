[Intro]
Lord I must know
If you've been weeping and wailing
Naughty, naughty
Who knows how that love had to linger on
Someone help
[Chorus]
Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate
[Verse 1]
If you go the bad way
You must prepare to get bad pay
The seed you sow, girl
This you shall surely reap, my brother and sister
[Chorus]
Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate
[Verse 2]
Lord have mercy now
(I feel the spirit)
Brother Moses got to be there
Also brother Peter got to be there
The sinners got to be there
I've got to be there too
[Chorus]
Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate[Bridge]
If you are from Canada
If you are from America
If you are from Africa
If you are from Jamaica
[Chorus]
You got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate
