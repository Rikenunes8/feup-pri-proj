[Intro: Pastor Clarence Keaton]
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him
[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens
And let me be free to
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
[Verse 2]
Can we recover
Will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent
That I feel the need to
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home[Interlude: Pastor Clarence Keaton]
He said He'll never forsake you
Or leave you alone
Trust Him
[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
I need you Lord, I need you Lord
I need you right here by my side
Keep your head up to the sky
With God's love you'll survive
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
(I need you Lord oh Lord)
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
(Please don't let the world, the world, the world break me tonight, tonight, tonight)
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
(I pray you'll come and take me home, hey Lord)
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Fly like a bird
(I need, I need you Lord)
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
(Carry me higher Lord)
I need the strength of you by my side
('Cause I need the strength of you to survive)
Sometimes this life can be so cold
(Life can be oh so cold)
I pray you'll come and carry me home
(Oh carry me home, oh carry me home, oh)[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
(I need you to come and carry me higher Lord)
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
(Carry me higher Lord)
Carry me higher, higher, higher
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home
(Higher Jesus)
Carry me higher Lord
