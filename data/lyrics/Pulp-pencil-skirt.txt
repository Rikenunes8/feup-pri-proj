[Verse 1]
When you raise your 
pencil skirt
Like a veil before my eyes
Like the look upon his face
As he's zipping up his flies
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, well, I know that you're engaged to him
Oh, but I know you want something to play with, baby
[Chorus]
I'll be around when he's not in town, oh
Yeah, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh
I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh-ah
Oh, it's turning me on
[Verse 2]
Now, you can tell some lies
About the good times that you've had
But I've kissed your mother twice
And now I'm working on your dad, oh, baby
[Chorus]
I'll be around when he's not in town, oh
Oh yeah, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh
I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh-ah
Oh, it's turning me on
Tu-tu-ru-ru
Tu-tu-ru-ru
Tu-tu-ru
[Verse 3]
If you look under the bed
Then I can see my house from here
So just lie against the wall
And watch my conscience disappear now, baby
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll be around when he's not in town, oh
Oh yeah, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh
I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh-ah
Oh, it's turning me on, yeah[Post-Chorus]
I only come here cause I know it makes you sad
I only do it 'cause I know you know it's bad
Oh, don't you know that it's ugly and it shouldn't be like that?
Oh but, oh, it's turning me on
