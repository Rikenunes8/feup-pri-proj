[Verse 1]
Highly inflammable
Waiting to explode
Neurotic tensions
Risen overflowed
[Chorus]
You thought I was a woman
I thought you were a man
I was Tinkerbell
And you were Peter Pan
[Verse 2]
Influenced by the fashion pages
Influenced by other's phrases
It ain't hip if you are retro
You're a pseudo quasi intellectual
[Verse 3]
Supreme equality
We used to compete
The right to decide
Is denied to the sheep
[Chorus]
You thought I was a woman
I thought you were a man
I was Tinkerbell
And you were Peter Pan
[Verse 2]
Influenced by the fashion pages
Influenced by other's phrases
It ain't hip if you are retro
You're a pseudo quasi intellectual
[Chorus]
You thought I was a woman
I thought you were a man
You thought I was a woman
I thought you were a man
You thought I was a woman
I thought you were a man
You thought I was a woman
I thought you were a man
I was Tinkerbell
And you were Peter Pan
