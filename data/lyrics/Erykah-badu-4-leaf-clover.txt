[Intro]
Bootzilla, baby!
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
[Verse 1]
Here I am, on a cloud
If you want me take the chance, try love out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting cupid's loving arrow you just might try
So don't miss baby, take your time
You've only got one chance, yes
[Hook 1]
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover (If you wanna be with me)
Love my get you over (You better pick the right one)
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
[Verse 2]
Like the wind, I am free
Going places, being things I wanna be
To settle down is oh so hard
But I will grant you that one chance
So pick the right card
And don't miss it, take your time
You've only got one chance, ooh wee ooh wee ooh

Free as a bird, yeah, yeah
To catch me is to catch a leprechaun
Hold on to your rabbit's foot
I just might be yours forever
You better
