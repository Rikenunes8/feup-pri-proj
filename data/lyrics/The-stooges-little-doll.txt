[Verse 1]
Little doll, I can't forget
Smoking on a cigarette
In my life, a real queen
Prettiest thing I ever seen
Uh-huh
You're the one who makes me sing
Bring happiness and everything
You're the only real one
A real way to have some fun
Uh- huh
But I don't know you little doll
I don't know you little doll
[Chorus]
Come on shake
Come on shake
Come on shake you little doll
Shake you little doll
[Chorus]
Come on... shake
Come on shake
Shake you little doll
