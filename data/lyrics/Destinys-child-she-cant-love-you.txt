[Intro: Beyoncé]
Whoa-yeah
Ah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-oh
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I saw your new girlfriend the other day
And I expected for her to be so much more than she was
I checked out her style
The way she smiled
The way she moved
The things she said
The way she looked at me like, "I got yo' man"
[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
She can't love you like I can
All of her love just can't compare to what I have
She can't touch you like I do
'Cause when y'all touchin'
You pretend it's me and you
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine (oh baby baby, baby-yeah)
There's no reason
For you to waste your time (no no no, no-no no)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When we were together
You told me what you didn't like
And you went out and got exactly that type
It's said that your new girl is nothing compared to me
Everything that she does wrong I always do right
[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
She can't hold you like I can
Boy, you a fool if you can't realize what you had
She can't feel you like I can
'Cause I'm a girl that's always standing by my man[Chorus: Beyoncé]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine (there's no-oh, no no way)
There's no reason
For you to waste your time (no, no no, no no reason)
And there's no way (oh, whoa-no)
Her love's as good as mine (mine, mi-ine, mine-mine, mine-mine)
There's no reason
For you to waste your time (ah-mine)
[Bridge: Kelly / (Beyoncé)]
There's no way, there's no way (oh oh-yeah)
That her love could be, could be good as mine (oh yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
There's no reason, no reason (for you)
For you to even go and waste your time (no)
Your time
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine (mi-mine, as mine)
There's no reason
For you to waste your time (time)
And there's no way (no, there's no way)
Her love's as good as mine (her love can be as good as, as good as mine, as mine, oh)
There's no reason
For you to waste your time (your time, time, yeah)
And there's no way (there's no way, there's no way)
Her love's as good as mine (that her love can be, can be as good as mine, oh-ooh-yeah)
There's no reason
For you to waste your time[Commandment #13: LeToya]
If thou can wait, then thou shalt stay
