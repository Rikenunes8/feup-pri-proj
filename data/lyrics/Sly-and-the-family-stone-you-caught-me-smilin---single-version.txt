You caught me smilin' again
You caught me smilin' again
Hangin' loose
'Cause you ain't used to seeing me turnin' on, ha ha
You caught me smilin' again
You caught me smilin' again
I'll be gone
And it won't take you long to climb a tree about me

You caught me smilin' again
You caught me smilin' again
I ain't down
I'll be around to carry on!
You caught me smilin' again
You caught me smilin' again
In my pain I'll be sane to take your hand
