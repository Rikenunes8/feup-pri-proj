[Intro]
"At the count of three, I want y'all to tell me the name of my DJ. One, two, three!"
"Terminator X!"
"Yo, I gotta hear that one more time, man. One, two, three!"
"Terminator X!"
"Yeah, boy! For all those that didn't understand, Terminator X!"
"Terminator X
Ah, savior of the universe"
"
Terminator X, it!

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
"The federal government is the number one killer and destroyer of Black leaders!"
[Verse 1]
Take a look at his style (Yeah!)
Take a check of the sound off the record people keepin' him down
Trick a chick in Miami, 
Terminator X packs the jams
Who gives a fuck about a goddamn Grammy?
Anyway, and I'm sayin' the D's defending the mike
Yeah, who gives a fuck about what they like, right?
The power is bold, the rhymes politically cold
No judge can ever budge or ever handle his load
Yes, the coming is near, he's about to become
The one and only missionary lord, son of a gun
Going on and on, back trackin' the whack
Explain the knack y'all for the actual fact, c'mon[Interlude 1]
"You dope pushers, using your fame as a DJ to sell drugs!"
[Chorus +

Go ahead
Terminator (Go off)

[Post Chorus]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
[Interlude 2]
"You on the radio, how long you think we gonna allow you to get away with that foolishness?"
[Verse 2]
(They go on and on) Until he reaches the coast
Tired, 
wired of his own race playing him close
Understand his type of music kills the plan of the Klan
You know the pack attack the man with the palm of his hands
Police, wild beasts, dogs on a leash
No peace to reach - that's why he's packin' his black piece
Terminator X, yellin' with his hands
Damn, almighty rulin', ready to jam
But his cuts drive against the belt
(Shit) He's bad by his damn self
Yeah, his one job, cold threaten the crowd
Loud sound pound makin' brothers proud (Boy)[Interlude 3]
"Black people's minds are being controlled in unity, Black music!"

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
[Interlude 4]
"You, in Black music! I'm warning you to change, your head is gonna roll!"
[Verse 3]
Gettin' small, makin' room for it all
(Flavor's on the phone, so I can make the call)
I know you're clockin' the enemy, you should be clockin' the time
Checkin' records I'm wreckin' you for defecting my rhyme
No provokin', no jokin', you know the stage is set
If you're thinkin' I'm breakin' (He ain't rocked it yet)
My education is takin' you for a long ride
I'll make your brain slip and do the (Slide)
Glide into infinity, it's infinite
With your hands in your pockets, I know your money is spent
Like this, like that, butter for the fat
(If you kill my dog, I'ma slay your cat)
It's like that y'all, can you handle it, son?
I'm Public Enemy number one[Chorus +

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Yeah, Terminator, yeah!
Rockin' like that! Like that! Like that!
Yeah, man! Yo, that's right, boy!
Terminator X, drivin' you to the edge of panic, boy!
Yeah, that's right!
And, yo, Terminator
Let 'em know you only speak with your hands, boy!
Haha, yeah!
