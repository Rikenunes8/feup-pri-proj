Take me higher, higher
Give me one more chance
And you’ll be satisfied
Give me two more chances
You won’t be denied
Well my heart is where it’s always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance
Let me be your lover tonight
You’re the real thing
Yeah, the real thing, (Yeah)
You’re the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Child
Give me one last chance
And I’m gonna make you sing
Give me half a chance
To ride on the waves that you bring
You’re honey child to a swarm of bees
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze
Give me one last dance
We’ll slide down the surface of things
You’re the real thing
Yeah, the real thing, (Yeah)
You’re the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Child
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher, higherTake me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Child
