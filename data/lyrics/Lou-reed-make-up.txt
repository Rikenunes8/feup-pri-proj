[Verse 1]
Your face when sleeping is sublime
And then you open up your eyes
Then comes pancake factor number one
Eyeliner, rose hips and lip gloss, such fun
You're a slick little girl
You're a slick little girl
Rouge and coloring, incense and ice
Perfume and kisses, ooohhh, it's all so nice
You're a slick little girl
You're such a slick little girl
[Chorus]
Now, we're coming out
Out of our closets
Out on the streets
Yeah, we're coming out
[Verse 2]
When you're in bed it's so wonderful
It'd be so nice to fall in love
When you get dressed I really get my fill
People say that it's impossible
Gowns lovely made out of lace
And all the things that you do to your face
You're a slick little girl
Oh, you're a slick little girl
Eyeliner, whitener then color the eyes
Yellow and green, ooohhh, what a surprise
You're a slick little girl
Oh, you're such a slick little girl
[Chorus]
Now, we're coming out
Out of our closets
Out on the streets
Yes, we're coming out
Yeah, we're coming out
Yeah, we're coming out
