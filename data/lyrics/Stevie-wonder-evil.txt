[Verse]
Evil, why have you engulfed so many hearts? Evil
Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds?
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide
Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred?
Evil, why have you stolen so much love?
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free, yeah-yeah
Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes? Evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world?
Evil, hey, evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes?
Leaving sweet love all alone, an outcast of the world
