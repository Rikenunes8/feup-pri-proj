"Watt Here!
I'm downstairs from your window, your uh...
Pub' phone booth, if you're up (I get tense)
[Beep]"
"Thurston! Watt! Thurston!
I think it's ten thirty
We're calling from Providence, Rhode Island
Did you find your shit?
You got to watch the 
mota
, Thurston
Your fucking memory just goes out the window
We couldn't find it in the van at all
We wondering if you looked in that trash can
When we threw out that trash, man
Was the bag in your hand?
Did you dump it?
Call later. Bye."
