[Verse 1]
PT boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Now I'm a guide for the C.I.A
Hooray for the U.S.A
[Chorus]
Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo
[Verse 2]
Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop, Havana-go-go
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Hooray for Havana
[Chorus]
Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo
[Verse 1]
PT boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Now I'm a guide for the C.I.A
Hooray for the U.S.A
[Chorus]
Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo
[Verse 2]
Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop: Havana-go-go
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Hooray for Havana
[Chorus]
Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo
