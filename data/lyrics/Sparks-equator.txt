[Verse 1]
I always felt that I had quite a gift
As a judge of human character
This is the day and the time and the place
And I wonder, wonder where you are
Surely we set it for 3PM
Surely we said it was March the 10th
[Chorus]
Equator, equator
You said you'd meet me there
You must be just around the bend
[Verse 2]
All of the gifts are now melted or dead
And I'm sorry, sorry in advance
I'll make it up to you, that I can promise you
If I am given just half the chance
God, you'll be laughing, I look a mess
But you see I've been half way around this place
[Chorus]
Equator, equator
You said you'd meet me there
Equator, equator
You said you'd be right there
Equator, equator
Oh yeah
[Verse 3]
I've got to stop here and rest for a moment
I'm sure that you're not far away
You always walked just as slow as you talked
Letting me think I could have my way
I wasn't fooled for a second, girl
I knew it was you who controlled our world
[Chorus]
Equator, equator
You said you'd meet me there
Equator, equator
You said you'd be right there
Equator, equator
Oh yeah[Outro]
Equator, equator
You said, you said, you said
Equator, equator
You said, you said, you said
