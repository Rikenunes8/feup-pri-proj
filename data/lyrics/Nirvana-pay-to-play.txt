[Verse 1]
Monkey see, monkey do (I don't know why)
Walk around, follow you (I don't know why)
Throw it out, keep it in (I don't know why)
Have to have poison skin (I don't know why)
[Chorus]
Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
[Verse 2]
Walk an inch, take a mile (I don't know why)
Never faded, never smiled (I don't know why)
Nevermind, eat and run (I don't know why)
Monkey ass motherfuck (I don't know why)
[Chorus]
Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
[Guitar Solo]
I don't know why
I don't know why
[Chorus]
Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
[Verse 3]
Monkey see, monkey do (I don't know why)
Walk around, follow you (I don't know why)
Throw it out, keep it in (I don't know why)
Have to have poison skin (I don't know why)[Chorus]
Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
[Guitar Solo]
I don't know why
I don't know why
[Chorus]
Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play

[Outro]
Pay to play
