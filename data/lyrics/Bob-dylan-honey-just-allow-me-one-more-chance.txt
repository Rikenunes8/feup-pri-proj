[Verse 1]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you
Well, I’m a-walking down the road
With my head in my hand
I’m looking for a woman needs a worried man
Just a-one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just a-one more chance
[Verse 2]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your airplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train
Well, I’ve been looking all over for a girl like you
I can’t find no better so you’ll have to do
There's just a-one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just a-one more chance
[Bridge]
Woo-hoo!
[Verse 3]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand
Just a-one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just a-one more chance
[Outro]
Woo-hoo!
There's just one kind favor I ask of you—
Allow me just a-one more chance, yeah
