[Verse 1]
There's a red moon rising on the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake
There's a red moon rising on the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake
[Verse 2]
There's an oil barge winding down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake
There's an oil barge winding down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake
[Pre-Chorus]
Cleveland, city of light, city of magic
Cleveland, city of light, you're calling me
Cleveland, even now I can remember
'Cause the Cuyahoga River goes smoking through my dreams
[Chorus]
Burn on, big river, burn on
Burn on, big river, burn on
[Verse 3]
Now the Lord can make you tumble
The Lord can make you turn
The Lord can make you overflow
But the Lord can't make you burn
[Chorus]
Burn on, big river, burn on
Burn on, big river, burn on
