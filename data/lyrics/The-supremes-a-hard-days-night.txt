[Verse 1]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
[Chorus 1]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
[Verse 2]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it to hear you say
You're gonna give me ev'rything
[Chorus 2]
So I love to come home
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
[Bridge]
When I'm home
Ev'rything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feelin' you hold me tight, tight
[Verse 3]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
[Chorus 1]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright, ow![Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 2]
So I love to come home
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
[Bridge]
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feelin' you hold me tight, tight
[Verse 4]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
[Chorus 1]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
[Outro]
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright
