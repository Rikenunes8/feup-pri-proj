[Verse 1]
I'm a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
You're the bird on the brim
Hypnotised by the whirl
Drink me, make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we're playing is life
Love's a two way dream
[Chorus]
Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
[Verse 2]
I'm a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You're the one who walks me
I'm your one-way street
I'm a whisper in the water
Secret for you to hear
You're the one who grows distant
When I beckon you near[Chorus]
Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
[Verse 3]
I'm a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You're the intruder's hand
I'm the branch that you break
[Outro]
[Gibberish]
