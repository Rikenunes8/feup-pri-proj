[Verse 1]
I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes, what can I say?
They turn me on
[Chorus]
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you
[Verse 2]
Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other, oh, so much
Why must we play this game?
[Chorus]
Don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you
[Bridge]
I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is to spend the night together
All I want is to spend the night in your arms
[Verse 3]
To be around you is so, oh, right
You're sheer perfection (
Thank you
)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection
[Chorus]
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you[Outro]
Just take me with you
Won't you take me with you?
Honey, take me with you
Whoo, hoo-hoo
Oooooo
