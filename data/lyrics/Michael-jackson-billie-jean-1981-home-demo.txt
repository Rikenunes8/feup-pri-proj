[Intro]
More kick and stuff in the phones, I need it
More bottom and kick in the phones
[Verse 1]
Tell me what did your daughter say, d-d-dong dong say?
All of the time
Alright, I see, alright
All of the time
Where we go, on the winds, in the wild
[Verse 2]
She told me I was a lonely man and I felt sad
She called my name then she said hello
All them who died
And I sit, in a cup, in a ride
[Pre-Chorus]
It seems that you, dun ber ber ber lee
Har-har thin walla man
Papa say, it doesn't care for what you do
Careful what you do
Buttercup a day, hey hey hey!
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that says that I am the one (do you know?)
The kid is not my son
Hey, hey, hey
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that says that I am the one (Do you know?)
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one (Oh no!)
But the kid is not my son (Hey, hey, hey)
(Hee, hee, hee)
