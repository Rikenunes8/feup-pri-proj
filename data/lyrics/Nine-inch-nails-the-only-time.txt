[Verse 1]
I'm drunk
And right now I'm so in love with you
And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
[Post-Chorus]
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
[Verse 2]
I swear
I just found everything I need
The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins are listening to me
Well, I want to rip it up and swim in it until I drown
My moral standing is lying down
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
[Post-Chorus]
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive[Outro]
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
