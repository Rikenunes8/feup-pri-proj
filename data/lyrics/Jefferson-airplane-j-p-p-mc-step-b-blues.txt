Got a feelin' comin' from inside
A love for you my friends that I can't hide
And on these words that come I hope you ride
And I hope that my feelin' and meanings come through
One short moment and I knew you
Like lookin' in a mirror I looked through you
My night time rider has flown to you
And I hope you can see me like I've been seein' you
This is a song of your hand
Written so you would understand
A special feelin' taken by my stand
And I know you're goin' to love me like I've been lovin' you
And because you had a hand to lend
And you know the sands of time are just made of sand
Even though you might be in another land
I know I am with you forever my friend
