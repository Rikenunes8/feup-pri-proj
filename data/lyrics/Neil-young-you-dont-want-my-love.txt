There's just one thing I'm askin' of you
There's just one thing, people, I want to ask of you
Don't you ever leave me, now, no matter what you do
There's just one thing I'm askin' of you

Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby, how wrong you would be
Don't take your love, don't take your love away from me

When I make a promise, you can bet that it's true
When I make a promise, you can bet that it's true
So put your chips down, empty your pockets, too
When I make a promise, you can bet that it's true

Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby, how wrong you would be
Don't take your love away from me


Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby, how wrong you could be
Don't take your love away
Don't take your love away
Don't take your love away from me
