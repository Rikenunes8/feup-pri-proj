[Chorus]
Jesus, doesn't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me
[Verse 1]
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
[Chorus]
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me
[Verse 2]
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
[Chorus]
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me
[Verse 3]
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
[Outro]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
