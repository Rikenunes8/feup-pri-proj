[Verse 1]
There's no stopping the cretins from hopping
You got to keep it beating
For all the hopping cretins
[Chorus]
Cretin! Cretin!
I'm going to go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop
Doing the Cretin Hop
Cretin! Cretin!
[Verse 2]
One-two-three-four
Cretins want to hop some more
Four-five-six-seven
All good cretins go to heaven
[Verse 1]
There's no stopping the cretins from hopping
You got to keep it beating
For all the hopping cretins
[Chorus]
Cretin! Cretin!
I'm going to go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop
Doing the Cretin Hop
Cretin! Cretin!
[Verse 2]
One-two-three-four
Cretins want to hop some more
Four-five-six-seven
All good cretins go to heaven
