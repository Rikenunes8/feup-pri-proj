[Refrain]
Sooner or later
This happens to everyone
To everyone
[Verse 1]
You can live your life lonely
Heavy as stone
Live your life learning
And working alone
Say this is all you want
But I don't believe that it's true
'Cause when you least expect it
Waiting 'round the corner for you
[Chorus]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
[Verse 2]
You can live a life of luxury
If that's what you want
Taste forbidden pleasures
Whatever you want
You can fly away to the end of the world
But where does it get you to?
'Cause just when you least expect it
Just what you least expect
[Chorus]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
[Bridge]
I know it sounds ridiculous
But speaking from experience
It may seem romantic and that's no defense
Love will always get to you[Refrain]
Sooner or later, sooner or later
This happens to everyone
To everyone
[Verse 3]
You can fly away to the end of the world
But where does it get you?
[Chorus]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
