[Verse]
Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long
Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long
You know I'm a country boy
And I don't know what's going on
Don't say I don't love you
Because I will never treat you right
Don't say I don't love you
Because I will never treat you right
I may be a country boy
But I will always treat you right
You know I'm a country boy
And I just love to stay out all night long
You know I'm a country boy
And I always will never treat you right
You know I'm a country boy
And I always will never treat you right
You know I'm a country boy
And I just love to stay out every night
