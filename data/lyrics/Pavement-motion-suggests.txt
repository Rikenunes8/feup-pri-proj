[Verse 1]
I traced my family lines
It ends up with a
Wave of passing grainy days
Forgetting she's away
Here's the straight and narrow:
Brought my wheelbarrow
And it's filled with the lies
And the dirt and the hurt
[Chorus]
But I won't need someone to let me be
I won't need someone to let me be
[Verse 2]
I bought the cotton threads
And the voice could soothe you
Captivate your senses
Like a ginger ale rain
Bones they got the marrow
C
urse the tainted pharaohs
Take off! Expect fun
You might learn how it runs
[Chorus]
But I won't need someone to let me be
No, I won't need someone to let me be
No, I won't need someone to let me be
No, I won't need someone to let me go
Let me be
