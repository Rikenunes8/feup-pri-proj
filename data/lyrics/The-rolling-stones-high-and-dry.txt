[Verse 1]
High and dry well, I'm up here with no warning
High and dry well, I couldn't get a word in
High and dry oh, what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry
[Verse 2]
A minute I was up there standing by her side
The next I was down there, well, left out of the ride and
High and dry, oh what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry
[Verse 3]
Anything I wished for I only had to ask her, yep
I think she found out it was money I was after
High and dry, oh what a weird letdown
She left me standing here just high and dry
All right
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 4]
Well, it's lucky that I didn't have any love towards her
Next time I'll make sure that the girl will be much poorer
High and dry, oh what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry[Verse 5]
High and dry, well, I'm up here with no warning, yep
High and dry, well, I couldn't get a word in
High and dry, oh what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry
[Outro]
Well, she left me standing here just high and dry
Well, she left me standing here just high and dry
