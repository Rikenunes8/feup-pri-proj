[Verse 1]
Revenge must be the reason
Why forgiveness was a thing I never knew
And someday soon, I know you plan to hurt me
But don't count on getting by with the things you do
[Chorus]
'Cause I'll always know when you've been cheating
And I'll always know when you've been untrue
I'll always know
[Verse 2]
Your heart is like a window
When I look inside, I see another man
But go on and lie and tell him how you fooled me
But remember I saw through your evil plan
[Chorus]
And I'll always know when you've been cheating
Yeah, I'll always know when you've been untrue
I'll always know
And don't forget it either
