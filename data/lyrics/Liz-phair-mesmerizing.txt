[Verse]
You said things I wouldn't say straight to my face, boy
You tossed the egg up
 and I found my hands in place, boy
After backing up as far as you could get
Don't you know nobody parts two rivers met?
Don't you know I'm very happy?
You know me well
I'm even happier
I like it
I like it
[Chorus]
With all of the time in the world to spend it
Wild and unwise, I wanna be mesmerizing too
Mesmerizing too
Mesmerizing to you, you
With all of the time in the world to spend it
Wild and unwise, I wanna be mesmerizing too
Mesmerizing to you
Mesmerizing to you, you
