Ain't nothing heavier than a [?] heart
[?] me down since we've been apart
But I've been carryin' that load
Carryin' that load
I've been carryin' that load alone
Well, it's slowing me down
Got me draggin' my shoes
And now I'm stuck with those Rhode Island blues
But I've been carryin' that load
Carryin' that load
I've been carryin' that load alone
Even when the sun comes out shining down
My days are lonely and dreary
And the only way skies could light up
Is you come over and sleep right near me
If you never come home
Oh well, we've had our fun
And I'll be thinking on it till my days are done
But I've been carryin' that load
Carryin' that load
I've been carryin' that load alone
Even when the sun comes out shining down
My days are lonely and dreary
And the only way skies could light up
Is you come over and sleep right near me
If you never come home
Oh well, we've had our fun
And I'll be thinking on it till my days are doneBut I've been carryin' that load
Carryin' that load
I've been carryin' that load alone
