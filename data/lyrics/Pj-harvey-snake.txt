[Verse 1]
You snake, you crawled between my legs
Said, 
"Want it all? It's yours, you bet
I'll make you queen of everything
No need for God, no need for Him
Just take my hand, you be my bride
Just take that fruit, put it inside"
You snake, you dog, you fake, you liar
I've burnt my hands, I'm in the fire
[Interlude]
Oh
Oh
[Verse 2]
You salty dog, you filthy liar
My heart it aches, I'm in the fire
You snake, I ate a true belief
Put rotten fruit inside of me
Oh, Adam, please! You must believe
That snake put it in front of me
That snake put it in front of me
In front of me
