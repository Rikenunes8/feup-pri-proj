[Verse 1]
Hey, look over yonder out in the rain
Soaking wet fever in my brain
Now, I ain't certain which way to go
But I got to move, sure
[Chorus]
Feeling blue, blue, blue, blue, blue [x3]
I'm feeling blue. I'm feeling blue
[Verse 2]
Hey, look over yonder behind the wall
They're closing in I'm about to fall
Now I'm no coward, but I ain't no fool
Feel it in my bones, my book is due
[Chorus]
Hey, look over yonder, up in the tree
There's a rope hanging just for me
Without a warning, without a warning
Things are piling up to break me down
[Chorus]
Hey, look over yonder, out in the street
People laughing by, walking easy
Now, I'm no sinner, but I ain't no saint
If it's happy, you can say I ain't
[Chorus]
I'm Feeling blue [x6]
