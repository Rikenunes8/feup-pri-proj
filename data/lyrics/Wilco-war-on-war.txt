[Verse 1]
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
There's a war on
[Chorus]
You're gonna lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
[Verse 2]
Let's watch the miles flying by
Let's watch the miles flying by
You are not my typewriter
But you could be my demon
Moving forward through flaming doors
[Chorus]
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive
Okay
[Chorus]
You have to lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive
[Chorus]
You have to die
You have to die
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive
Okay
