[Verse 1]
The taste of champions
The pace, the pace
The speed, the need
The need to seed
The chance to die
[Chorus]
Another dead, don't cry
Another dead, don't cry
You've still got speed
You'll maybe bleed
But there's less time
[Verse 2]
More speed than before
Less time than before
You're rich, not poor
What are you doing it for?
Want more, want more
[Chorus]
Another dead, don't cry
Another dead, don't cry
You've still got speed
To feed from speed
Doing it all the time
