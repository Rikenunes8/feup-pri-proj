[Chorus]
Everybody get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm going to stay here 'til I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long
[Verse]
Yeah, it might be one o'clock and it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain't had this much fun since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again
[Chorus]
Oh, get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm going to stay here 'til I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long, yeah
[Bridge]
All night
Takes all day
All night and all day
[Chorus]
I'm gonna get in the groove and let the good times roll
Stay here still I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long
[Verse]
Yeah, it might be one o'clock and it might be three
I don't care 'cause time means nothing to me
I ain't been swingin' since I don't know when
And I might not be swingin' this way again
[Chorus]
Oh, get in the groove and let the good times roll
You can stay here 'til you soothe your soul
If it takes all night long, yeah[Outro]
All night
All day
All night and all day
I'm gonna stay here
I ain't gonna move
Go on, soul brother
Help me find the groove
I don't care who's knocking on my door
Somebody answer
