[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout the—
Let me—, let me tell you 'bout the chicken grease
Oh, oh, stuffs and things to make the people get out their seat
Ooh-ah, everybody, it's cool if you wanna clap your hands and stomp your feet
Come on down to the front where you can feel the beat, oh-oh-oh
Well, from the left to right, to the back, the middle and the front
Don't be uptight, shake it off and do what you want
But let me pump it in the club and get a little bit a rub-a-dub (Yeah)
Oh-oh, I know you love me 'cause I'm funky 'cause I just wanna show you some love
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, to my brothers on the avenue
Huh, chicken grease
If you see us in the streets
Good God, chicken grease
[Verse 2]
Uh-oh, to get to the other side, y'all cross the road
But not the kid, see I'm like that old bucket of crisco
That's sittin' on top of the stove
Simmer, simmer to a sizzle like the days of old (Oh, wait a minute)
But I'll wait 'til I've mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers won't miss
Fried 'til it's burned and crisp (Fried 'til it's burned and crisp)
See we be cookin' so the funksters can raise their fist like this (Oh)
Now you know how it's goin' down
Start at your neck, then (Chicken grease)
Through your back, then it works its way down to your feet (Like that, baby)
So unique, come on everybody, let's uh-uh-uh (Let's dance to the beat)
[Refrain]
I just wanna put you down (Yeah)
I just want y'all to get down (Yeah)
Everybody come get down (Yeah)
To the chicken grease (Gimme a little bit of that chicken grease)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-uh-uh, uh-huh[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
If you wanna come on down to the front
But baby, yo, it's cool, it's cool
Uh, everybody that's fakin' the funk to put you in school (Put you in school, uh)
But take a lesson from the best discussions, adolescence to man
I got the music and the instruments, use 'em as my weapons at hand
 (Oh)
Everybody on the floor, uh, you got to listen to me (Yeah)
Clap your hands (Clap your—), and just stomp your feet (Yeah, your feet)
[Refrain]
Ah-ah-ah
I just wanna put you down (Yeah)
I just want y'all to get down (Yeah)
Everybody come get down (Yeah)
To the chicken grease
Everybody, everybody, yeah
[Chorus]
Uh-uh, I got the chicken grease (Oh)
Southside for you, baby (Oh)
Get me outchea, get me—, check the beat (Chicken grease)
[Outro]
