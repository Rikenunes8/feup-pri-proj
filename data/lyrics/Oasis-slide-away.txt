[Verse 1]
Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now
[Verse 2]
Hold me down all the world's asleep
Need you now you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
But you said, "Please don't!"
[Pre-Chorus]
Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying but I don't know what you're saying to me
[Chorus 1]
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way of chasing the Sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way to do what we've done
Let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now
[Pre-Chorus]
Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying
And I know just what you're saying to me[Chorus]
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way to do what we've done
Oh, let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
Slide away (and I wanna try now, I wanna make you mine now)
[Outro]
Oohhhh, Ooh-oohhhh!
Oohhhh, Ooh-oohhhh!

All I know is you can take me there)

All I know is you can take me there) Slide away

All I know is you can take me there) Slide away

All I know is you can take me there) Slide away

All I know is you can take me there) Slide away
