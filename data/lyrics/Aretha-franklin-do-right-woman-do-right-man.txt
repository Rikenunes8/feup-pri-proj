[Verse 1]
Take me to heart, and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unshown
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong
[Pre-Chorus]
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
[Chorus]
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Do right, do right, do right, do right man, man)
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me
[Chorus]
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Do right, do right, do right, do right man, man)
[Pre-Chorus]
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
[Chorus]
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you?)
You got to be a do right, home nights man
