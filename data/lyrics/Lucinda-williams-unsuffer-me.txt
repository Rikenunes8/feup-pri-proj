Unlock my love
And set me free
Come fill me up
With ecstasy
Surround my heartbeat
With your fingertips
Unbound my feet
Untie my wrists
Come in to my world
Of loneliness
And wickedness
And bitterness
Unlock my love
Unsuffer me
Take away the pain
Unbruise, unbloody
Wash away the stain
Anoint my head
With your sweet kiss
My joy is dead
I long for bliss
I long for knowledge
Whisper in my ear
Undo my logic, undo my fear
Unsuffer me
Unlock my love
And set me free
Come fill me up
With ecstasy
Unsuffer me
Take away the pain
Unbruise, unbloody
Wash away the stain
Surround my heartbeat
With your fingertips
Unbound my feet
Untie my wristsCome in to my world
Of loneliness
And wickedness
And bitterness
Anoint my head
With your sweet kiss
My joy is dead
I long for bliss
I long for knowledge
Whisper in my ear
Undo my logic, undo my fear
Unsuffer me
