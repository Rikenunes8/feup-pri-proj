[Speaking Intro]
You know, boy
You're so busy reaching for a dream
That doesn't even exist
You can't even see someone
Who's standing right here
Who loves you so much
And I've tried
Oh I've tried
But I want you to still know this
That all you got to do is reach out for me
And I'll be there
Anytime you want me
[Chorus]
All through the night
Lay your head on my shoulder
You can make love to my mind
And you feel the magic
Don't be afraid
[Break-1]
Quit searchin'
Anticipatin'
Stop reachin'
For that distant star
[Verse-1]

Boy don't pass the moment
The light's right before your very eyes
[Chorus]
[Break-2]

If you want let good be
Me waiting at your door
[Chorus 2x]
[Interlude]

Boy don't pass the moment
The lights right before your very eyes

All through the night

And if you feel the magic
Don't be afraid
