Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
But I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I feel uplifted and at ease
Since my heartaches went away
Someway, somehow I've gotten over you now
No more sitting by the phone
Mo more wondering if you're alone
Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
Getting over you was hard cause we were so close

Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
How happy I am now that I'm over you
It's so wonderful this change in me
How rejoiced I am to be over you at last no more ...Tossin' and turnin' and losin' my sleep
Cause heartaches by the number you gave to me
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
I'm so glad heartaches don't last always
