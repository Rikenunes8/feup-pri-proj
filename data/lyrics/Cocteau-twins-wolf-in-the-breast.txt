Under my shirt, Have to amass
Sling the tainted words
I'm each arms they fall on
It's my body, Puzzles the trick in me
I lend it out to borrow, it might survive
My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed, I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when, I'll revenge, all I'll need's that day
It's my body, Puzzles the trick in me
I lend it out to borrow, it might survive
My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when
I'll revenge, all I'll need's that day
I'll feel perpetual
I feel perpetual

True blue and real
I feel, I feel
True blue and real
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when
I'll revenge, all I'll need's that day
I'll feel perpetual, I feel perpetual
I'll feel perpetual
True and real
