[Verse 1]
Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy
Happy!
[Chorus 1]
Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic, a little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness, all over me
Four leaves on a clover
I'm just a bit of a shade hung over
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet-eyed blindness good to me?
[Verse 2]
Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good mornin'
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good mornin'
Mornin'!
[Chorus 2]
Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic, a little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness, all over me
Please don't tell my mother
I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet-eyed blindness good to me?
[Bridge]
Don't ask me 'cause I ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
I ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
Wine of wonder
Wonder!
[Chorus 3]
By the way, sweet blindness (oh, sweet day)
A little magic, a little kindness (good morning)
Oh, sweet blindness, all over me (oh, sweet day, I love you)
Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in the gin mill spirit
Don't let daddy hear it (Don't let daddy hear it)
He don't believe in the gin mill spirit
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet-eyed blindness good to me, good to me?
Now ain't that sweet-eyed blindness good to me?
