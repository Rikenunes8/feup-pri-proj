[Intro]
Let's go, girls!
Come on!
[Verse 1]
I'm going out tonight
I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout
No inhibitions
Make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time
[Pre-Chorus]
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman![Verse 2]
The girls need a break
Tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance
We only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down
[Pre-Chorus]
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Uh-huh
Oh, yeah[Pre-Chorus]
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun (Fun, fun)
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel (To feel the way I feel)
Man! I feel like a woman!
[Outro]
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
I get totally crazy
Can you feel it?
Come, come, come on, baby!
I feel like a woman!
