If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot
If I was your man
Hey hey, yeah
If I was your man
If I was your best friend
Would you let me
Take care of you
Do all the things that only your best friend can
Oh oh oh
Only best friends can

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress ya
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes
Sometimes those are the things that being in love's about
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me
If somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah yeah ooh
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please, yeah
Oh oh[Refrain: TLC]
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend
[Break: T-Boz]
If I was your girlfriend
I know I could treat you right
I could see what you see
And hear what you hear
But most of all, heh
I could feel what you feel
Oh, make me wanna say
