[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, look how you got me standing around crying
Oh, baby, look how you got me standing around crying
I know I don't love you little girl
But you're always resting on my mind
[Verse 2]
Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile
Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile
You got so many men
That I'm afraid you may get me killed
[Verse 3]
Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be
Oh no, don't get me killed, honey
Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be
When I was deep in love with you little girl
You was just sweet as an apple on a tree
