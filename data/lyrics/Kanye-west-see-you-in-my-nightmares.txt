[Intro: Kanye West & 
Lil Wayne
]
I'm cold (
Yeah
)
I'm cold (
Yeah
)
I'm cold (
Yeah, yeah
)
[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door
Door, door, door, door
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that, you know
[Chorus: Kanye West]
That, you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you 'cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you'd get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Baby girl, I'm finished, I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented, I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it, and now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision, look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you, girl, we through
You think your ish don't stank, but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know, that you know
[Chorus: Kanye West]
That, you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
