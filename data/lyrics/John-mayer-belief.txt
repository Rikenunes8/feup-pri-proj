[Verse 1]
Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily
[Verse 2]
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly
[Chorus]
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
[Verse 3]
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
[Outro]
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can
