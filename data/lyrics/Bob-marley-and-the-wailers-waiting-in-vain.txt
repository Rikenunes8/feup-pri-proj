[Intro]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
[Verse 1]
From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see
[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
And I'm still waiting there
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 2]
Like I said:
It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door
And I still can knock some more
Cuckoo girl, cuckoo girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn - tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting - while I'm waiting for my turn
See!
[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh![Outro]
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna wait in vain
No, I don't wanna (I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain) -
No I - no I (I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't
Wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain) -
No, no-no, I, no, I (I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain) -
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain);
It's me love that you're running from
It's your love that I'm waiting on 
(I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain);
It's me love that you're running from
