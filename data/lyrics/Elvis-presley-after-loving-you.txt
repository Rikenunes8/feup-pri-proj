[Verse 1]
But now after loving you
What else is there to do?
For honey, all the rest
Is just gonna have to be second best
I know I'll go through life
Comparing her to you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you
[Verse 2][x2]
Your precious love cannot be erased
By just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain
For it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along
They can't live up to you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you
I said I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you
I said I'm no good
I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
To anyone, to anyone, to anyone
After loving you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
