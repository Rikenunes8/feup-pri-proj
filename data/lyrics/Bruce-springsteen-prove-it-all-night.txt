[Verse 1]
I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean
We'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline
To buy you a gold and a pretty dress of blue
Baby, just one kiss will get these things for you
A kiss to seal our fate tonight
A kiss to
[Chorus]
Prove it all night, prove it all night
Girl, there's nothing else that we can do
Said prove it all night, prove it all night
And, girl, I'll prove it all night for you
[Verse 2]
Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this
But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice
But this ain't no dream we're living out through the night
And, girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price to
[Chorus]
Prove it all night, prove it all night
Prove it all night girl and call the bluff
We prove it all night, prove it all night
Girl, I prove it all night for your love
[Verse 3]
Baby, tie your hair back in a 
long white bow
Meet me in the fields 
behind the dynamo
You hear their voices telling you not to go
They made their choices and they'll never know
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie
What it's like to live and die to
[Chorus]
Prove it all night, prove it all night
There is nothing else that we can do
Say prove it all night, prove it all night
And, girl, I prove it all night for you[Outro]
I prove it all night, I prove it all night
I prove it all night, I prove it all night
I prove it all night, I prove it all night
I prove it all night, I prove it all night
