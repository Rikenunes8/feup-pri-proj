It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days
You sang beautifully just now
I sing for him and he isn't here
It's going down, man, word, man
 (
What's up, black?
)
Niggas just fuckin' robbed my gate, man
 (
Word?
)
[

It's raining, he's changing (
Fuckin'— Yo, I'ma murder somebody, man, for real, I ain't playing
, 
whatever, man, whatever
)
My man is going insane, insane (
The war is on, yo
)
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes the only pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mocs, socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Maxmil blast Pierre
That was Build Build, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, 
howdy, Jake, Starks is back
Niggas want work, nine brought back off a g-pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops, live in gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it
, 
the projects over-flooded with slow leaks
The fiends geek, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, 
like my old Earth
, bless the cheese line
Sipping on fine wines, the power of the blacks refined
(Rainy days) 
Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee
But that's ungodly, so, yo, God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dough flow like penmanship
Meatheads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit, nigga, what?[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane
It's raining (Past sunlight, more gunfight)
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
What brings rain, hail, snow, and earthquakes?
The beat breaks, 'cause all my niggas to break, son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once, though the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu, son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects infested with rats, cats, and crack, holmes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake, half real freedom-build
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 
1010 WINS
, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?[Chorus: Blue Raspberry & 
Raekwon
]
It's raining, he's changing (
Word up dun
)
It's raining he's⁠—, my man is going insane (
Peace to Philly, VA, these days, word up, y'all
)
My man is going insane (
Word up, the sun, moon and stars, fly cars, word up y'all
)
[Outro: Blue Raspberry]
No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life
Street life (I've lost him to the street life)
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know
Someone I don't know
Rainy Days
Getting through those rainy days
Getting through those rainy days
Getting through those rainy days
Getting through those rainy days
I lost him to the street life
The street life, woah
