The mid-twenty joys
Around a heart that's black and blue
Tattooed love boys
I tore my knees up getting to you
'Cause I needed
To find out what the thing was for
Been reading
Man, the time came to explore
I went apewire
'Cause I thought
Like I'd like it
Little tease
But I didn't mean it
But you mess with the goods, doll
Honey, you gotta pay
Yeah
A good time
Was guaranteed for one and all
The tattoos
Target practice in the hall
While waiting
For their number to get called out
I, I, I, I found out what the wait was about
I was a good time
Yeah, I got pretty good
At changing tires
Upstairs, bro
I shot my mouth off and you showed me what that hole was for
Now I see you
All impressed and half undressed
You got paint stick
All over the scars and lumps and bumps
Tattooed love boys
Have got you where I used to lay
Well, ha ha and too bad
But you know what they say
"Stop snivellin'
You're gonna make some plastic surgeon a rich man"
Oh, but the prestige and the glory
Another human interest story
You are that
