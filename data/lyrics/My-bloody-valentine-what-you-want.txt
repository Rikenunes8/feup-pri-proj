[Verse 1]
What I do I say but I can't get far away
Oh, I go back to a memory again
What you want but you know that I'm alive
Then I'll go back to you, don't you know how I feel inside?
[Chorus]
When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want, don't you know that I can smile?
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside
[Inaudible]
[Verse 2]
Turn around and smile
No, they can't see through your eye
Could I fall into the one who calms my mind?
Come back down, no, I can't believe my mind
Then it surrounds you, don't you know that I asked why
[Chorus]
When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to the one who calls my name out
What you want, let me know that I'm alive
Then I go back to you and then you make him go inside
[Incomprehensible]
