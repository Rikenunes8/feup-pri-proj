[Verse 1]
Memories and drinks don't mix too well
And jukebox records don't play those wedding bells
Looking at the world through the bottom of a glass
All I see is a man who's fading fast
Tonight I need that woman again
What I'd give for my baby to just walk in
Sit down beside me and say it's alright
Take me home and make sweet love to me tonight
[Chorus]
But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sitting with all my friends and talking to myself
I look like I'm having a good time, but any fool can tell
That this honky-tonk heaven really makes you feel like hell
[Verse 2]
I light a lonely woman's cigarette
And we start talking about what we want to forget
Her life story and mine are the same
We both lost someone and only have ourselves to blame
[Chorus]
But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sitting with all my friends and talking to myself
I look like I'm having a good time, but any fool can tell
That this honky-tonk heaven really makes you feel like hell
