So it gets to seven
And I think of nothing
But living in darkness
And the diamond lady
Well she's not telling
I don't even know her name
It's amazing
Times have changed
In days of old
Imagination'd leave you standing
Out in the cold
Dancing city
Now you're talking
But where's your soul
You've a thousand faces
I'll never know
True to life
True to life
There are complications
And compensations
If you know the game
Agitated in Xenon nightly
I'll take you home again
Travel way downtown
In search of nothing
But the sky at night
And the diamond lady
Well she's not talking
Yeah, that's alright
True to life
True to life
True to lifeSo I turn the pages
And tell the story
From town to town
People tell me
Be determined
Poor country boy
Too much luck
Means too much trouble
Much time alone
But arm in arm
With my seaside diamond
I'll soon be home
