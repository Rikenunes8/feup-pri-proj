[Verse 1]
Ayo, baby, I know why you're here
I know what you're doing
I can see it in your eyes, you're up to somethin'
I know what it is, but we're still cool
And we can socialize, I'm peepin' ya, baby
I'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go
'Cause a fool don't have a shoulder to cry on, so
Give me a kiss and you can sing this
Whether you like a mister or a miss

Baby, you're my dear

I know what you're thinkin', I know what you need
And that's what I've got, you think that I'm crazy
No, I'm not drinking, I know what you want
I made ya want it, take my hand
Listen to the man, you have a plan, don't even risk it
What do you want, a biscuit?

[Verse 3]
Honey, I know what you're up to, I know how you're livin'
I know where you go when you leave my house
I know what your dreams are, but I dream too
You're with a man, you're not with a mouse
I see how you stare, I see how you smile
I see right through, now act like you knew
I know all about where you been runnin'
Wipe your feet before you come in

Yeah, that's smooth
Let's just sit here and relax while my man plays the piano for us
Sip somethin' mellow
And discuss why you're here
But of course I ain't sayin' nothin'
[Verse 4]
Okay, now that you know
I know you know that I know you know
And that's the move, so sit right here
Whisper in my ear, caress my chest
And say somethin' smooth, but don't forget
I know what you'll say
Just what I thought, I know the routine
I know the routine, just what I thought
I know you tell the truth, I know you don't lie
Shh, close your eyes
