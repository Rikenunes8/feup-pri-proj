[Verse 1]
Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities
[Chorus]
They keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
[Verse 2]
Where figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the halls
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share
[Chorus]
They keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
[Bridge]
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
[Chorus]
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
They keep calling me
