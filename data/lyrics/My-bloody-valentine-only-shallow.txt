[Verse 1: Bilinda Butcher]
Sleep like a pillow, no one there
Where she won't care, anywhere
Soft as a pillow, touch her there
Where she won't dare, somewhere
[Verse 2: Bilinda Butcher]
Sweet like a mallow, softer, fair
Feel like you could swallow her
Sleep, going to tremble, she's not square
Soft like there's silk everywhere
[Verse 3: Bilinda Butcher]
Sleep as a pillow, comfort there
Where she won't dare, anywhere
Look in the mirror, she's not there
Where she won't care, somewhere
