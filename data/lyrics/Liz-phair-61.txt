[Verse 1]
I bet you fall in bed too easily
With the beautiful girls who are shyly brave
And you sell yourself as a man to save
But all the money in the world is not enough
[Verse 2]
I bet you've long since passed understanding
What it takes to be satisfied
You're like a vine that keeps climbing higher
But all the money in the world is not enough
And all the bridges blown away keep floating up
[Pre-Chorus]
It's cold
And rough
[Chorus]
And I kept standing six-feet-one
Instead of five-feet-two
And I loved my life
And I hated you
[Pre-Chorus]
It's cold out there
And rough
[Chorus]
And I kept standing six-feet-one
Instead of five-feet-two
And I loved my life
And I hated you
