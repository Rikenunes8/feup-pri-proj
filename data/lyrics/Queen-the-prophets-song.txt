[Intro]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man!
[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw, on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
[Pre-Chorus]
"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh-oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove
[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved, babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain
[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry![Chorus]
Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan
[Bridge]
Oh, oh
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you?
[Acapella Canon]
Ah, people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know, I know
I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
Death all around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know, now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Listen to the wise, listen to the wise
Listen to the wise, listen to the wise
Listen to the wise man

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Listen to the man, listen to the man
Listen to the man, listen to the madman[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
"Listen to the madman"
[Outro]
Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman
