The street lights are shining bright (tonite)
The billboards are shedding their light (tonite)
My crowds are hanging around tonite
There's a charge in the air (tonite)
It's kind of electric out here (tonite)
And we're all out on the town
Action, gonna track it down
Gonna turn some heads tonite
There's nothing, there's no one to stand in our way
Get dressed up and messed up, blow our cares away
Our minds set on seeing this night through 'til day
We rule the streets tonite, until the morning
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
The boulevard is crowded and loud (tonite)
It's time for excitement right now (tonite)
There's no better world to be found
If there was, we'd give it all for a lifetime like tonite
There's nothing, there's no one to stand in our way
Get dressed up and messed up, blow our cares away
Our minds set on seeing this night through 'til day
We rule the streets tonite, until the morning
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
There's nothing, there's no one to stand in our way
Get dressed up and messed up, blow our cares away
Our minds set on seeing this night through 'til day
We rule the streets tonite, until the morning light
