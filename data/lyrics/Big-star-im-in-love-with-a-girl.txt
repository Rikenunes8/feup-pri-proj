I'm in love with a girl
Finest girl in the world
I didn't know I could feel this way
Think about her all the time
Always on my mind
I didn't know about love
All that a man should do is true
All that a man should do is true
I'm in love with a girl
Finest girl in the world
I didn't know this could happen to me
