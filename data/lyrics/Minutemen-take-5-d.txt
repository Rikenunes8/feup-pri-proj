Hope we can rely on you not to use shower...
You're not keeping the tub caulked
Caused both downstairs bath ceilings and walls to be soggy
Tub has to be properly caulked prior to you showering
Walls are drenched -- both roofer and plumber here
Had to pay for two service calls
Water drips from all around
Kathy's ceiling, my ceiling
Don't use shower... don't use shower...
