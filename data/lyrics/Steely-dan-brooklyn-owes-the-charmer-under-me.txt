[Verse 1]
A race of angels bound with one another
A dish of dollars laid out for all to see
A tower room at Eden Rock
His golf at noon for free
[Chorus]
Brooklyn owes
 
the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
[Verse 2]
His lady's aching to bring a body down
She daily preaches on where she wants to be
An evening with a movie queen
A face we all have seen
[Chorus]
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
[Instrumental break 1:48-2:34]
[Verse 3]
A case of aces done up loose for dealing
A piece of island cooling in the sea
The whole of time we gain or lose
And power enough to choose
[Chorus]
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Yeah, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
[Instrumental outro 3:37-4:19]
