[Verse]
I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life searching for that four-leaf clover
Yet you ran with me, chasing my rainbows
Honey, I love you too and that's the way love goes
[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say "Honey, now don't worry"
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes
[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say "Honey, don't worry"
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes
