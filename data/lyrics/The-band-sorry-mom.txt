I've done a lot that I regret
Said things that I wish I'd never said
I'm trying, I'm human, I don't know what I'm doing
This is me just being real with you I guess

Sometimes I get drunk
Sometimes I say, "Fuck"
Sometimes I talk about things you don't like in my songs
I've gone home with girls a lot
I don't know if there's a God
Sometimes I try to act like I don't know right from wrong
I'm sorry Mom
I'm sorry Mom

I admit I don't call home enough
I've never been good at that kind of stuff
I'm selfish, I'm stubborn, a terrible big brother
But you still pray that one day I'll grow up

Sometimes I get drunk
Sometimes I say, "Fuck"
Sometimеs I talk about things you don't like in my songs
I've gone homе with girls a lot
I don't know if there's a God
Sometimes I try to act like I don't know right from wrong
I'm sorry Mom

I'm sorry Mom

I wish that I could find the words
To tell you how much that it hurts
That I'm not who you wanted me to be
But no matter what I've done
No matter how far I run
I just hope deep down you're proud of me
Sometimes I get drunk
Sometimes I mess up
I hope you know I love you, even if you hate this song
I'm sorry Mom
I'm sorry Mom
