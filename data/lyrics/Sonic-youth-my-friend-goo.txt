[Verse 1]
My friend Goo has a real tattoo
She always knows just what to do
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care
What she does best is stand and stare
[Chorus]
She can play the drumset too
And the boys say, "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo just says, "P-U"
My friend Goo just says, "P-U"
[Verse 2]
I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
She likes to wear green underwear
And lays down almost anywhere
[Chorus]
She doesn't have nothing to do
And the boys say, "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo goes, "P-U"
My friend Goo just goes, "P-U"
[Verse 3]
I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
I know a secret or two about Goo
I know a secret about Goo and you
[Chorus]
And she sticks just like glue
And the boys go, "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo just goes, "P-U"
My friend Goo just goes, "P-U"
[Bridge]
Goo, Goo, Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo[Outro]
Goo, Goo, Goo
My friend Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
Talkin' 'bout Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
My friend Goo
Goo, Goo, Goo
You would too
Goo
