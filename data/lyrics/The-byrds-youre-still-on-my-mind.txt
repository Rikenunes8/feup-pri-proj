The jukebox is playin' a honky-tonk song
"One more", I keep sayin', "and then I'll go home"
What good will it do me, I know what I'll find
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
The people are dancin' and havin' their fun
And I sit here thinkin' about what you have done
To try and forget you, I've turned to the wine
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
Alone and forsaken, so blue I could cry
I just sit here drinkin' till the bottle runs dry
What good will it do me, I know what I'll find
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
