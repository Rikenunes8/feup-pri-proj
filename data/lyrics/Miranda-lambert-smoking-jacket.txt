[Chorus 1]
I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts
[Verse 1]
He might be heavy on the pedal
But he knows how to take it slow
He might be quite continental
But he's sure gonna take me home
Yes, he is
[Chorus 2]
I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a car that's classic living bourgeoisie
I want a man whose heart is tragic
But he makes his magic every night on me
[Verse 2]
We go together just like nicotine and Chanel
And when he lights up I'm his Lucky Strike
Waiting for him to exhale
[Chorus 1]
I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts[Bridge]
Velvet and refined, he's designed to hold me
I don't need a diamond, I like wearing his smoke rings
I want a man, I want a man
I want a man
[Chorus 3]
I want a man with a smoking jacket
And he lights his matches with kerosene
[Outro]
I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacket
I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacket
