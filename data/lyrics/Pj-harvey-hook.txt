[Verse 1]
I was blind, I was lame
I was nothing till you came
And said, "Babe, make you sing
Make you feel like some queen"
[Chorus]
Said, "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Lord, he hooked me
Fish hook and line
[Verse 2]
And rode in barking mad
With a halo of deep black
Till my love made me gag
Call him Daddy, take my hand
[Chorus]
Said, "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Good Lord, he hooked me
Fish hook and line
[Bridge]
I'm hooked
Oh higher
Oh beautiful
Oh higher
Oh beautiful
Oh higher
[Verse 3]
Now I'm blind and I'm lame
Left with nothing but his stain
"Daddy, your maid, she can't sing
She can't feel, she's no queen!"[Chorus]
Said, "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line
[Outro]
Said, "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Good lord he hooked me
Clean out of time
