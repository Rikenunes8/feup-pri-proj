[Verse 1]
The reason why, oh, I can't say
I had to let you go, baby, and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
[Verse 2]
Baby, for a long time, you had me believe
That your love was all mine and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
[Verse 3]
Now I gotta say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games any more
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
[Outro]
Yeah, I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
