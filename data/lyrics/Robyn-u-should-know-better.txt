[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, wee (Ooh, wee)
[Verse 1: Robyn 
with Snoop Dogg
]
I've gone around the world and the seven seas
I'm cashing six-figure checks in all currencies
It's like when I be tearing it up in Paris
Motherfuckers parler on the M-I-C
It's all ooh-la-la and ahh-
oui-oui
Sipping vin blanc in our lingerie
Chopping heads off with madame guillotine
Even the French know better than to fuck with me
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & (Robyn)]
Comment allez-vous, Robyn, what it do
I'm in the UK (Why?), I've got a show to do (Uh-huh)
It's big Snoopy Dogg, check the catalog
I'm overseas, getting cheese with this dialogue
I missed my plane to Spain, so I'm stuck in Cologna
I'm sipping Saronno with this chick named Ramona
She wants me to take a flick on her phone-ah
(She) Then take her to my hotel room and then bone her
[Verse 3: Robyn & (Snoop Dogg), 
Both
]
You know when in Rome, I sat down with the Romans
Said, 
"We need a black pope and she better be a woman"
(She bangin') There'll be no more celibacy
Even the Vatican knows not to 
fuck with me
[Chorus: Robyn & 
Snoop Dogg
]
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better, you would do better
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better, you would do better
[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
We big-ballin' in Holland, Amsterdam, my man
I got a table at the 
coffee shop
Where we like to spark a lot
Hangin' in the parking lot, blowin' a bleezy
Easy fo' sheezy deezy[Verse 5: Robyn]
I crashed a party with the Czar
Threw a Molotov cocktail in the bar
And you know my style's revolutionary
Even the Russians know better than to fuck with me
[Verse 6: Snoop Dogg]
You try to ban me, you can't stand me
'Cause I'm an outlaw
Black president livin' in the White House
Mr. B, he wrote a letter to me
The FBI know better than to fuck with me
[Verse 7: Robyn & (Snoop Dogg)]
Yo, I was there at Watergate (Gate)
You know I rigged my gear, got the fuckers on tape
They put the mic in the hand of the wrong MC (MC)
Even the CIA knows not to fuck with me (What it is)
[Chorus: Robyn & 
Snoop Dogg
]
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better, you would do better
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me[Refrain: Robyn]
Tell 'em Snoop, tell 'em like it is
[Bridge: Snoop Dogg & 
Robyn
]
I been there, in there, out there like that
Right back to the hood, a hundred Euro stacks
Shoot motherfuckers just on GP
LAPD know better than to fuck with me
(You see) I danced with the devil in Kathmandu
I came hummin' and blastin' with the boogaloo too
Now I declare most solemnly
The prince of darkness know better than to fuck with me
[Verse 8: Snoop Dogg]
You know not what you know
Tell 'em what I'm in it for
The world been it
Then I run up in it slow
Really though, silly ho
Yeah, it's been a minute though
I blow an ounce and make you bounce just like a sixty-four
[Verse 9: Robyn & (Snoop Dogg)]
Now you know me, I'm a woman of peace (Hey)
I don't never take nothin' don't belong to me
I throw down and say, "Whatever's gonna be, gon' be"
The whole industry knows not to fuck with me
[Chorus: Robyn & 
Snoop Dogg
]
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better, you would do better
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better, you would do better
You should know better
 (Y-you should know better)
(Y-y-y-y-y-y) 
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better, you would do better
