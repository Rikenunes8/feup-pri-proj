[Chorus]
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
[Verse]
Quiet thoughts come floating down
And settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories
[Refrain]
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days, with you
[Chorus]
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories
[Refrain]
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilight trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days, with you
[Chorus]
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories, sweet memories
Memories
