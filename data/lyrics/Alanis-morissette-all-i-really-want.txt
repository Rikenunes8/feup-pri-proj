[Verse 1]
Do I stress you out?
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, "How appropriate!"
I don't wanna dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart, you see
But I can't help it
[Pre-Chorus]
And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with the splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter
[Chorus]
And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah
[Verse 2]
Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy
[Pre-Chorus]
And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I'm humbled by his humble nature, yeah
[Chorus]
And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah[Bridge]
Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses falling
All around, all around
[Verse 3]
Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here, can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer
[Chorus]
And all I really want is some peace, man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah[Outro]
It's all I really want, some patience
A way to calm me down
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is some justice
