Don't say the word
If you don't want it done
Don't tell me your name
If you don't want it sung
Don't come any closer
That's good enough
Don't go away
I can't stand the thought
It's too warm
Inside your hands
It's too hard
It's too good
It's just that when you touched me
I could not stand up
I fell into
I fell down
Why can't you tell me
Is it worth a fight
Do I sound crazy
Well I just might
Why do your words
Have to ring so false
Why do your eyes
Have to change so much
It's too warm
Inside your hands
It's too hard
It's too good
It's just that when you touched me
I could not stand up
I fell into
I fell down
Turn, turn it on, turn, turn it on
You can turn it on, turn it into my song
I want to turned on, turn it all night long
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Turn, turn it on, turn, turn it on
You can turn it on, turn it into my song
I want to turned on, turn it all night long
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it onTurn, turn it on, turn, turn
You can turn it on, turn it into my song
I want to turned on, turn it all night long
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Don't say the word
If you don't want it done
Don't tell me your name
If you don't want it sung
