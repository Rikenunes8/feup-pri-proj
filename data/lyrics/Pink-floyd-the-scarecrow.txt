[Verse 1]
The black and green scarecrow, as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn’t care
[Refrain]
He stood in a field where barley grows
[Verse 2]
His head did no thinking, his arms didn’t move
Except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground
[Refrain]
He stood in a field where barley grows
[Verse 3]
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he’s resigned to his fate
‘Cause life’s not unkind – he doesn’t mind
[Refrain]
He stood in a field where barley grows
[Outro]
