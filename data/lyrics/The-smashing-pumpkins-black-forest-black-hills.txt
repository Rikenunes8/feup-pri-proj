With the noise that brought you
Paladin and dare
To gouge, bellwether
That which can't be shared
Crow by crow
And stone by stone, we flowed
From hidden spring to cold
There ain't but cold
Unto which I've flown, sweet fold
Longing just to belong
Cape the wind and cape your kind
And cape the wynds that back
How you've held to chance
Delivered as forgiven
Cape the wind and cape your kind
And cape the wynds that back
How you've held to chance
Delivered as forgiven
Crow by crow (Crow by crow, crow by crow)
Stone by stone (Stone by stone, stone by stone)
(Stone by stone, stone by stone, stone by stone)
Wish me how I won't provide for you
Spell me how these tales ought to be
Side along, confound me
Side along, despair
The weight, precision
The odds by faith, unfair
Crow by crow
And stone by stone, we flowed
From hidden shoal to cold
And oh, that cold
Tell me where I'm told, to know
Darkness is forbidden
There ain't but cold
Unto which I've flown, sweet fold
Longing just to belongCape the wind and cape your kind
And cape the wynds that back
How you've held to chance
Delivered as forgiven
Crow by crow (Crow by crow, crow by crow)
Stone by stone (Stone by stone, stone by stone)
(Stone by stone, stone by stone, stone by stone)
Wish me how I won't provide for you
Spell me how these tales ought to be
