She can have, she, like her birthday, sooth
To sing swan song
She gave her cold hand to he, who'd been just
A drunken hot ghost
She's sucking up again, but happy
As the day is long
She can have she, like her birthday, sooth
To sing swan song
She can have, she, like her birthday, sooth
To sing swan song
She gave her cold hand to he, who'd been just
A drunken hot ghost
She's sucking up again, but happy
As the day is long
She can have she, like her birthday, sooth
To sing swan song
She can have, she, like her birthday, 
sooth
To sing
 
swan song
She gave her cold hand to he, who'd been just
A drunken hot ghost
She's sucking up again, but happy
As the day is long
She can have she, like her birthday, sooth
To sing swan song
