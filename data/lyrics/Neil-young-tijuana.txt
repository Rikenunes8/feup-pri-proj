In the crystal ball the gypsy sees the villa
The riders on the hill, the fire in the fields
She sees the mission bell swinging in the silence
Now the shooting starts, the bullets pierce the hearts
The senoritas crying at the well


Up in the Gold Hotel the money hits the table
The heavies all are there, that's why the deal's going down
Beautiful women all dressed in diamonds and sable
Down upon the street beside a garbage heap
A mariachi band begins to play

Somewhere a blues guitar plays echoes in the alleyway
The Tijuana dawn claims another day
The golden sun rises on the runway
The pilot understands, the money changes hands
Inside the jet, the briefcase snaps goodbye


In Eldorado town there lives a great bullfighter
His eyes are screaming blue, his hair is red as blood
And when the gate goes up, the crowd gets so excited
And he comes dancing out dressed in gold lam√©
He kills the bull and lives another day
