[Verse 1]
The Mississippi Delta
Was shining like a National guitar
I am following the river down the highway
Through the cradle of the Civil War
[Chorus]
I'm going to Graceland, Graceland
Memphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received in Graceland
[Verse 2]
She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
[Chorus]
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
And my traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received in Graceland[Verse 2]
There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
"Whoa, so this is what she means"
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Well, everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow
[Chorus]
Ooh
In Graceland, Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received in Graceland
[Break]
(Ooh)[Chorus]
Woah
In Graceland, Graceland, Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
