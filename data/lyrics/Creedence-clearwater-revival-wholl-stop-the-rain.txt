[Verse 1]
Long as I remember, the rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring, confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun
[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
[Verse 2]
I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Five year plans
 and 
new deals
, 
wrapped in golden chains
[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
[Verse 3]
Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring, falling on my ears
[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
