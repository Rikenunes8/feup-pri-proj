[Verse 1]
Last night, we were watching this game show
They were talking 'bout marriage and that stuff, you know
I found myself laughin' 'cause those couples weren't clear
And then here he comes with this bright idea, so I said to him
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you mean well
You're genuine, I can tell
Besides, you and me
I know that we would soar
But are you ready?
You gotta be sure, you gotta be sure
[Chorus]
Oh no, I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby, your price ain't right, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Hey, this is my life, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby, your price ain't right, I know
You feel like hitting the ceiling, hold on
Hey, this is my life
[Verse 2]
So we're arguing, talking about it back and forth (Back and forth)
And forth and back as if there is no source
And now I'm wondering, is this what he had in mind?
Cause if I thought we'd get through that door
Tell me what's gonna be my price, so I said to him
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you mean well
You're genuine (Genuine), I can tell
Besides, you and me
I know that we would soar
But are you ready?
You gotta be sure, you gotta be sure
(You gotta be sure)[Chorus]
Oh no, I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby, your price ain't right, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Hey, this is my life, hold on
I know you got the feeling, hold on
Baby, your price ain't right, I know
You feel like hitting the ceiling, hold on
Hey, this is my life
