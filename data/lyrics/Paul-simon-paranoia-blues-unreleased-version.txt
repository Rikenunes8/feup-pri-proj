I got some so-called friends
They'll smile right to my face
Oh, when my back is turned
They'd like to stick it to me
Yes they would
Oh no no, oh no no
There's only one thing I need to know
Whose side are you on?
I fly into J.F.K
My heart goes boom boom boom
I know that customs man
He's going to take me
To that little room
Oh no no. Oh no, no
There's only one thing I need to know
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on?
Paranoia blues
Down and out in New York City
Roll me for a nickel
Stick me for an extra dime
Anyway you choose
You're bound to lose in New York City
Oh, I just got out in the nick of time
I just got out in the nick of time
Oh, I'm loosening my tie
Taking off my shoes
I know before I die
I gott to shake these paranoia blues
Oh no no
Oh no no
There's only one thing I need to know
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on?
Paranoia blues
Down and out in New York City
Roll me for a nickel
Stick me for the extra dime
Anyway you choose
You're bound to lose in New York City
Oh, I just got out in the nick of time
I just got out in the nick of timeWhen I'm going to Chinatown
I want some good Chow Fon
Oh don't you bring me down
Don't you tell me my Chow Fon's gone
Oh no, no
Oh no, no
There's only one thing I need to know
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on?
Well, there's only one thing I need to know
Whose side are you on?
