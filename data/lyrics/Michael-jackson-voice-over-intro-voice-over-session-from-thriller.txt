[Narration]
And now a behind-the-scenes treat from the original voice-over session for "Thriller", with Michael and Vincent Price. You'll also hear the never-before-released second verse of Vincent's rap, written by Rod
[Bruce Swedien]
Okay, tape's rolling. Any--anytime you want
[Intro, take 1: Michael Jackson & 
Vincent Price

Hi, this is Michael Jackson
This is Vincent Price
Michael Jackson is...
The Thriller!

*Vincent laughs*
Do we both say it?
Say it together?
"Inviting you to."
I say "inviting you to"? All right. Yeah
Okay
Any time. Tape's rolling
[Intro, take 2: Michael Jackson, 
Vincent Price

Michael Jackson & Vincent Price

Hi, this is Michael Jackson
And this is Vincent Price, inviting you to...
The Thriller!
[Verse 1: Vincent Price]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
[Verse 2: Vincent Price]
The demons squeal in sheer delight
It's you they spy, so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip[Verse 3: Vincent Price]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller
[Outro: Vincent Price]
Can you dig it?
Hmmm-Hahahahaha...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahahahahahahah...
[Post-outro: Vincent Price & 
Bruce Swedien
]
Hmmph, that's great fun!
Great, thank you. Cut
Okay. All right!
