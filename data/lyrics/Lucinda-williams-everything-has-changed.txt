I can't feel my love anymore
I can't feel my love anymore
The mystery and the splendor
Don't thrill me like before
And I can't feel my love anymore
I don't want to talk to anyone
I don't want to talk to anyone
All the words that used to work
Have melted in the sun
And I don't want to talk to anyone
Faces look familiar, but they don't have names
Towns I used to live in have been rearranged
Highways I once traveled down don't look the same
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
I can't find my joy anywhere
I can't find my joy anywhere
All the magic vanished
Into the misty air
And I can't find my joy anywhere
Now I don't know where my faith has gone
Now I don't know where my faith has gone
From the wonder I had a sense of
To the brightest star that shone
And now I don't know where my faith has gone
Faces look familiar, but they don't have names
Towns I used to live in have been rearranged
Highways I once traveled down don't look the same
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
