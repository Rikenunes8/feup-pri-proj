[Verse 1]
To love her is to learn her
And see her at her worst
Dance with her when she's drinking
Hold her when she hurts
She'll be happy, you'll be sorry
Well, that's just how it works
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
[Verse 2]
You'll meet her mama, you'll love her daddy
You'll know how much she's worth
You'll have Thanksgiving dinners
And Sunday morning church
You'll be true and you'll be tried
But the tables always turn
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
[Verse 3]
It's a lesson, it's a blessing
You don't know everything
If you take her you might hate her
And be left with just a ring
To love her is to lose her
Hey, that's just how it works
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
Oh, to love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
