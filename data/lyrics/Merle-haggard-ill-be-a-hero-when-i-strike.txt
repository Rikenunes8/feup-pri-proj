All because I walk a different street
And not helloed by some I meet
That don't mean that what I do ain't right
Those that said that I was wrong
Now say thay knew it all along
'Cause I'll be a hero when I strike
I'll be a hero when I strike
Come up tight and out of sight
They'll say I'm dynamite
And they'd like to be there when I lite
'Cause I'll be a hero when I strike
I love God and the flag
And I ain't the kind to stand and brag
And I'm the kind to stand right up and fight
Don't need a uniform to wear
To make the people stop and stare
'Cause, Hoss, I'll be a hero when I strike
I'll be a hero when I strike
Come up tight and out of sight
They'll say I'm dynamite
And they'd like to be there when I lite
'Cause I'll be a hero when I strike
Won't shake hands until I'm sore
Wear medals hangin' to the floor
They'll throw rocks at Franklin and his kind
They'll say, boy, ain't that cowboy hot
There ain't nothin' he ain't got
But I'm gonna be a hero when I strike
I'll be a hero when I strike
Come up tight and out of sight
They'll say I'm dynamite
And they'd like to be there when I lite
'Cause I'll be a hero when I strike
