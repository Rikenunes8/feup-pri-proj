[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out-of-tune guitar
Ooh, she got a Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes
Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way
[Pre-Chorus]
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)
[Chorus]
I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
[Verse 2]
Oh, and it hurts like hell to see my girl messin' with a muscle boy
No Superman gonna ruin my plans
Playin' with my toys
Rich man sweatin' in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbin' in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washin' in a bucket of mud
Washin' in a bucket of mud[Pre-Chorus]
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)
[Chorus]
I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
[Guitar solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)
[Chorus]
But I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
(Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
