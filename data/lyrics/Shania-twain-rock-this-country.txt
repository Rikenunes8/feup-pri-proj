[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning with a buzz rollin' 'round in my brain
I haven't been drinkin', but it feels pretty good just the same
It must be contagious, looks like it's goin' around
It's cool once you catch it, you can't keep your feet on the ground
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh now, come on, come on, let's get something started
(Let's get something started now)
Come on, come on, let's start something now
(Let's start something now)
[Chorus]
We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right outta this world
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 2]
From Utah to Texas, Minnesota, Mississippi too (That's right)
Or Nevada, no matter where you live, this buzz is for you (That';s right)
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get something started
(Let's get something started now)
Oh yeah, come on, come on, let's start something now
(Let's start something now)
[Chorus]
We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right outta this world
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Let's go
Hey, hey, hey[Bridge]
We're pluggin' in the power
Crankin' up the sound
It's comin' your direction
It's headin' to your town
We're kickin' up dust
Blowin' off steam
Let's get nuts
Now everybody scream
[Chorus]
We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Got gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right outta this world
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ah-ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Outro]
Get ready, we're comin'
