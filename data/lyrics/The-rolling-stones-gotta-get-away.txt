[Verse 1]
Baby, the truth is out so don't deny
Baby to think I believed all your lies
Darlin' I can't stand to see your face
It's the truth, you understand
[Chorus]
I got to get away, got to get away
Got to, got to, got to get away
Got to get away
[Verse 2]
Baby, I don't want to live here no more
Baby, though I tore your pictures off my walls
Darling this old room is falling in on me
You understand the truth now
[Chorus]
I got to get away, got to get away
Got to, got to, got to get away
Got to get away
[Verse 3]
Baby, oh, how could you take away your clothes
Baby, don't screw up this old heart of gold
Darling, this will rule my social flair
You understand me now
[Chorus]
I got to get away, got to get away
Got to, got to, got to get away
Got to get away
