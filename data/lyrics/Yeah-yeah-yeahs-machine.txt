[Verse 1]
Savage things wash over me
A crime that leaves the heated green
[Hook]
Oh machine
Machine, I washed it for you
Oh machine
Machine, I wasted for you
[Verse 2]
And I walk, and I walk
The space left for two
And I wait, and I wait
To wake next to you
And I walk, and I walk
The space left for two
And I wait, and I wait
To wake next to you
[Hook]
[Outro]
Machine, machine
I washed it for you
