Starship, starship take me
Take me where I want to go
Out there among the planets
Let a billion suns cast my shadow
Starship, starship take me
Stretch our legs in time and space
Take a passage through the vacuum
Let me feel the stars burnin' on my face
Ten for the gravity, checkpoint
Nine for polarity, checkpoint
Eight for the (?)
Seven for the prismatic time warp
Six for the spirit of the captain, captain
Five for the power of the nucleus nebula
Four for the eyes, ears, nose, think, feel, speak
Three for the many levels
Two for the chromosome
One for the energy
One for the energy
One check
One check

LeavingIt's cold in sunfire glory
From this point I rise to infinity
There is a land whose beauty is almost
Unimaginable to the human mind
In a daze we stand there and look further
Than the ordinary eye can see
Children, far above the roof of this world
We can encompass vistas of the worlds
There is a land where the sun shines eternally
Eternally, eternally
Out in outer space
A living, blazing fire
So vital and alive
That it burns our eyes
To witness its splendor!
