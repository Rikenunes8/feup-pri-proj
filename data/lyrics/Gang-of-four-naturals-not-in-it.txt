[Verse 1]
The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses
Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest
Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine
The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
[Verse 2]
Coercion of the senses
We're not so gullible
Our 
great expectations
A future for the good
Fornication makes you happy
No escape from society
Natural is not in it
Your relations are of power
We all have good intentions
But all with strings attached
[Bridge]
Repackaged sex (keeps) your interest
Repackaged sex (keeps) your interest
Repackaged sex (keeps) your interest
Repackaged sex (keeps) your interest
Repackaged sex (keeps) your interest
Repackaged sex (keeps) your interest
