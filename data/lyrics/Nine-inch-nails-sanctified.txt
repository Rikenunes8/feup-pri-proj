[Verse 1]
It's still getting worse after everything I've tried
What if I found a way to wash it all aside?
What if she touches with those fingertips
As the words spill out like fire from her lips?
[Pre-Chorus]
If she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
If she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
[Chorus]
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
[Verse 2]
Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell (bitch)
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed
Well, she knows exactly what I can't resist
[Pre-Chorus]
And if she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
[Chorus]
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
[Interlude]
Dear mom and dad
This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write
I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never have to know about it, but that just isn't possible now
I don't know what's going to happen, but what can I say to you? Will "I'm sorry" make a difference? Will it ease the pain?
The shame you must be feeling, forgive me, please
[Verse 3]
I'm just caught up in another of her spells
Well, she's turning me into someone else
Everyday I hope and pray that this will end
But when I can, I do it all again[Pre-Chorus]
And if she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her
[Chorus]
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you
I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you

As surely as the blade's course is run
Maybe my kingdom's finally come
