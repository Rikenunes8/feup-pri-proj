[Intro]
High five
High five
High five
High five
Come on, hey, everybody
Come on, seven, come on now, six, five
Gimme five
Aw yeah, I like that shit
Gimme five
One more time, gimme five
[Verse 1]
When I rock it's like a high five
Want a slap in the face, I love the taste
All my days with my wheelchair ways
Watch me die in my suicide high
I don't mean it 'cause I only come on to you
When I step to the room with a powerful motion
Leopard skin let the records spin
'Round and round with the speed of sound
[Chorus]
High five, more dead than alive
(
Rocking the plastic
 like a man from the 
Catskills
)
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
[Verse 2]
Rocky Mountain low, we gotta go
Put that gadget in the random mode
Cripple candy rocking the candy
Rumba, brick shot, doing the foxtrot
In my car sweating like a dog
Beers and chairs, new frontiers
On my way from the 'Frisco bay
Dixieland, soda pop man[Chorus]
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
[Interlude]
Yeah, put that machine in random mode
Talking about popping juggler
Like, like the last century
Turn that shit off, man
What's wrong with you, man?
Get the other record
Damn
[Chorus]
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
High five, more dead than alive
(Rocking the plastic like a man from the Catskills)
[Outro]
Okay, now do like designer jeans
Everybody, designer jeans
Say, say, say, say, say ooh, la la
Sasoon, come on, come on, come on
Everybody
One more time, let me hear you say ooh, la la
Sasoon, just do it everybody, come on
Now I want the ladies
All the ladies, say Sergio Valente (Sing it, girl)
Let me hear you say Sergio Valente
And say Jordache said it, ah
