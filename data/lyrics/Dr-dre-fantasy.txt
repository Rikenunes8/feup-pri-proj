Welcome to the playground for the bosses
If you ever counted us out, bitch, you couldn't count
Motherfuckin' absurd amounts
The unthinkable (Go 'head, speak the truth)

I'm makin' pussy niggas push the panic button (Boss)
I'm watchin' all these niggas runnin' out of money
Waterfalls, foreign cars and Italian luggage
Man I'm just, just showing off my war scars and they all love it
I want it all, marble walls and my dawgs muddy (Chea)
Southside of Compton and did it all from nothin' (Huh)
Above the law, I get a call and we all comin' (Heh)
Once they know I push the button, niggas start runnin' (Bang)
Fuck 'em all, livin' large and we all gunners (Ay)
I'm still in charge, temper short with the tall numbers
Expensive cars, still extortin' all the frauds comin'
I could buy the Dodgers with my credit card money
It's a fantasy for niggas on the other side (I say)
I'll be damned if I don't put my family first in line (Family)
Such a tragedy what happened to them other guys (I pray)
Don't be mad at me, it's just the way this shit designed (Some way)

Fantasies for niggas that done fantasized (Fuck 'em)

In them funny pants, I had a gun in mine (Chea)
LeBron James numbers, go 'head, analyze 'em
Will Smith bitches in the summertime (Woop, woop)
It's still Cali love until they gun me down (Blaow)
I did a verse, he gave your boy a hundred pounds (Woo)
Rozay and Doc Dre, now how the fuck that sound? (Huh)
They love the candy paint, they wanna see it bounce (Yes)
Ayy, my nigga, I might let down the top and take the scenic route (Yes)
I just wanna mob and maybe steam an ounce
Bitch, it's Doc Dre, Impalas, bring 'em out (Huh)
