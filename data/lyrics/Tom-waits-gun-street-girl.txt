Falling James in the Tahoe mud
Stick around to tell us all the tale
Well, he fell in love with a Gun Street girl
And now he's dancing in the Birmingham jail
Dancing in the Birmingham jail
Took a 100 dollars off a Slaughterhouse Joe
Bought a brand new Michigan 20 gauge
Got all liquored up on that roadhouse corn
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow Corvette
A hole in the hood of a yellow Corvette
Bought a secondhand Nova from a Cuban Chinese
Dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past 4
He left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door
He left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door
I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
Sitting in a sycamore in St. John's Wood
Soakin' day-old bread in kerosene
He was blue as a robin's egg and brown as a hog
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired
Out of circulation till the dogs get tiredShadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone
He never got up in the morning on a Saturday
Sittin' by the Erie with a bull-whipped dog
Tellin' everyone he saw they went thatta way
Tellin' everyone he saw they went thatta way
Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof
And the Burlington Northern's pullin' out of the world
Now a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw
And a Gun Street girl was the cause of it all
A Gun Street girl was the cause of it all
Riding in the shadow by the 
St. Joe Ridge
He heard the click clack tappin' of a blind man's cane
He was pullin' into 
Baker
 on a New Year's Eve
With one eye on the pistol and the other on the door
One eye on the pistol and the other on the door
Miss Charlotte
 
took her satchel down to
 
King Fish Row
And she smuggled in a brand new pair of alligator shoes
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair
Well, they tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire
Tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire
I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming homeBangin' on a table with an old tin cup
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again
I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again
I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again
I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
