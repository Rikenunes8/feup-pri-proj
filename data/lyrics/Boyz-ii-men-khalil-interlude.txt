[Interlude]
To ease the pain
Of changing from Boys II Men
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from Boys II Men
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from Boys II Men
