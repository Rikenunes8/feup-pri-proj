[Verse 1]
Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?
[Verse 2]
Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, faith is down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back
[Pre-Chorus]
It's what I want (It's what I want)
It's what I want (Twine comes down)
It's what I want (It's what I want)
Don't you know? I could make it dry, make it dry, make it dry, make it dry
[Chorus]
I've been crowned the king of it
And it is all we have
, so wait
To hear my words and they're diamond-sharp
I could open it up and it's up and down
[Instrumental Post-Chorus]
[Pre-Chorus]
It's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg like a little dog (Ball and twine)
Don't you know that it's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg,
 and 
it makes you dry
Make me dry, make me dry, make me dry
[Chorus]
I've been down, the king of it
It's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait to hear the words
They're diamond-sharp today[Instrumental Post-Chorus]
