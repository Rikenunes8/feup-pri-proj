Everybody is a star
Who would rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Who'll come out on a cloudy day
'Til the sun that loves you proud
When the system tries to bring you down
Ever had to shine tonight
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right
Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel you need to be
Ever catch a falling star?
Ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle goin' round and round
Shine, shine, shine, shine
