My brightest star's my inner light let it guide me
Experience and innocence bleed inside me
Hallucinogens can open me or untie me
I drift in inner space, free of time
I find a higher state of grace, in my mind, I'm beautiful
I wasn't born to follow
I live just for today, don't care about tomorrow
What I've got in my head you can't buy, steal or borrow
I believe in live and let live, I believe you get what you give
I've glimpsed, I have tasted, fantastical places
My soul's an oasis, higher than the sun, ah
Higher than the sun, higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun, I'm higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun, I'm higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun, I'm higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun, I'm higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun, I'm higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun, I'm higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun
