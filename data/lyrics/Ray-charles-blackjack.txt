[Verse]
Let me tell you people about this blackjack game
It's caused me nothing but trouble and I've only myself to blame
Hey hey hey yeah, how unlucky can one man be?
Well every quarter I get, Lord, blackjack takes it away from me
[Verse]
My friends don't come around me 
because I've been so blind
I can't even borrow a nickel, now I've almost lost my mind
Hey hey hey yeah, ow unlucky can one man be?
Well every quarter I get, Lord, blackjack takes it away from me
[Verse]
I sat there with two tens, I thought I'd have some fun
The dealer hit sixteen with a five, just enough to make twenty-one
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, how unlucky can one man be?
Well every quarter I get, yeah, blackjack takes it away from me
