[Verse 1]
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna get my soul free
[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
[Verse 2]
Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning
[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
[Bridge]
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation[Chorus]
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
(To some semblance of a garden.)
