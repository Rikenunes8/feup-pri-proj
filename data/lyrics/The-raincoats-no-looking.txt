He put sugar in his coffee
He stirred coffee with a teaspoon
He poured milk into sweetened coffee
He lifted the cup up to his lips
He drank coffee 'til was empty
He put cup back onto saucer
Without looking at me
Without looking at me
He took cigarette from his packet
He lit cigarette with his matches and
He blew smoke rings with the smoke
Without looking at me
Without talking to me
He put his hat onto his head
He put raincoat 'cos it was raining and
Oh he did have no umbrella
And he left in the rain
Without looking at me
Without talking to me
Silently no looking
Talking to no one else
Leaving me without looking
Looking at me without leaving
Leaving me without looking
Silently without looking
You leaving me, leaving me
Looking at me without speaking
Speaking to me without looking
Looking at me without talking
Talking to me without leaving
Leaving me without looking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talkingNo looking at me, no looking at me
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking at me
