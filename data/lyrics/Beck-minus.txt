[Verse 1]
The last survivor of a boiled crown
Another casualty with the casual frown
The janitor vandals, they bark in your face
Juveniles with the piles and paste
[Chorus]
It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage glasses
With the crutches of frogs
[Verse 2]
Don't be confused when the fuse is up
And you're taking a leak into your brother's cup
When the cup is filled you can run and be killed
In the billion miles of the muscles that build
[Chorus]
Radiation
Feeling the force
Karaoke
Vomiting morons
[Verse 3]
The scalps of zero hear the call
Rubbing in a blind man's goddamn hall
With the 
canker sores
 and the robot pills
Throwing imbeciles on the window sills
[Chorus]
It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage glasses
With the crutches of frogs
Frogs
Frogs
