[Intro]
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?
[Verse]
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?
