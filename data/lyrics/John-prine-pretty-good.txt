[Verse 1]
I got a friend in Fremont, he sells used cars, ya know?
Well, he calls me up twice a year just to ask me. "How'd it go?"
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same"
[Verse 2]
I met a girl from Venus, her insides were lined in gold
Well, she did what she did, said "How was it, kid?", she was politely told
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same"
[Bridge]
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen
[Verse 3]
Molly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain
'Cause actually, all them dogs are just about the same
[Bridge]
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast
And up in the sky an Arabian rabbi fed Quaker oats to a priest
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain
'Cause actually, all them gods are just about the same[Outro]
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
'Cause actually, everything is just about the same
