[Verse 1]
Makes no difference now what kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along without you now, it's plain to see
I don't care what happens next, I'll forget somehow
And I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now
[Verse 2]
It was just a year ago when first I met you
And I learned to love you and I thought you loved me, too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
Well, I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now
[Verse 3]
Now that we have really parted, I can't believe it's true
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it did somehow
Woah, I just don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now
[Verse 4]
After all is said and done I'll forget you
Although I know that it will be hard to do
Let things happen as they will, I'll get along somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now
[Outro]
It makes no difference
Oh, no difference now
It makes no difference now
