Well you know there ain't no doubt
When the feeling finds you out
You know you can try to run
I tell you it still will come
When you feel your body shake
Trip and fall you can't walk straight
Baby then you know it's done
You can feel your heart is stung
You're the one that I saw
You're the one that I want
Well you can try to keep it down
Try not to let the words come out
But I tell you it's no use
In your eyes they see right through
If you're going way too hard
If you're feeling way too much
But inside you can't stop
Desire she eats you up
You're the one that I saw
You're the one that I want
