I would do anything, anything you say
If you would just be mine
What more, what more can I say?
I would give anything, anything I own
If you'd be my love
What more, what more can I say?
Anything I've got to give, it's not a lot to give
Baby if I'm giving it to you
Anything is nice to give
I don't have to think twice to give
That's how much I love you Daddy
That's how much I love you
I say that's how much I love you
That's how much I love you
I would go anywhere, anywhere you go
If you just say you wanted me too
What more can I say?
