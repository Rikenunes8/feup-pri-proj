[Verse 1]
Young velvet porcelain boy
Devour me when you're with me
Blue wish window seas
Speak delicious fires
[Chorus]
I'm your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
[Interlude]
Moist warm desire
Fly to me
[Chorus]
Your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
I'm your candy perfume girl
Candy, candy
[Verse 2]
Rush me ghost you see
Every center my home
Fever steam girl
Throb the oceans
[Chorus]
Your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
Candy perfume girl
[Bridge]
Did I lie to you?
Candy perfume girl
Did I lie to you?
Magic poison
You're a candy perfume boy
A candy perfume boy
You're a candy perfume boy
You're candy
Candy perfume girl
The sacred nerve is magic poison
Candy, it's candy[Outro]
I'm your candy perfume girl
I'm your candy perfume girl
Boy, girl, boy, girl, boy
Candy
