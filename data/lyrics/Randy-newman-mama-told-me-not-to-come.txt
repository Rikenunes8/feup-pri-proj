Will you have whiskey with your water
Sugar with your tea?
What are these crazy questions that they're asking me?
This is the wildest party
That there ever could be
Oh, don't turn on the light, 'cause I don't want to see
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
Mama said, That ain't no way to have fun
Open up the window, let some air into this room
I think I'm almost choking on the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smoking 'bout to scare me half to death
Open up the window, let me catch my breath
The radio is blasting
Someone's beating on the door
Our hostess is not lasting – she’s out on the floor
I seen so many things here I ain't never seen before
I don't know what it is, but I don't wanna see no more
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
Mama said, That ain't no way to have fun
