By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song
In a strange land?
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Requiring of us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song
In a strange land?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let the words of our mouth and the meditations of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
Let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down

There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion
