[Verse 1]
Daytime just makes me feel lonely
At night I can only dream about you
Girl you're on my mind nearly all of the time
[Chorus]
It's so hard being here without you
[Verse 2]
Words in my head keep repeating things that you said
When I was with you
And I wonder is it true do you feel the same way too
[Chorus]
It's so hard being here without you
Being here without you
[Bridge]
Though I know it won't last I'll see you some day
It seems as though that day will come never
But there's one thing I'll swear though you're far away
I'll be thinking about you forever
[Verse 3]
The streets that I walk on depress me
The ones that were happy when I was with you
Still with all the friends I know and with all the things I do[Chorus]
It's so hard being here without you
Being here without you
