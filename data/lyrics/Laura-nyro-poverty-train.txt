[Intro]
Last call for the poverty train
Last call for the poverty train
[Verse 1]
It looks good and dirty on shiny light strip
And if you don't get beat you got yourself a trip
You can see the walls roar, see your brains on the floor
Become God, become cripple, become funky and split
Why was I born
Whoa whoa no no no-no
Whoa whoa no no no-no
No no no no
[Verse 2]
Oh baby, I saw the devil and he's smiling at me
I heard my bones cry devil why's it got to be
Devil played with my brother, devil drove my mother
Now the tears in the gutter are floodin' the sea
Why was I born
Whoa whoa no no no-no
Whoa whoa no no no-no
No no no no-oh
[Verse 3]
Oh baby it looks good and dirty them shiny lights glow
A million night tramps tricks and tracks will come and go
You're starvin' today but who cares anyway
Baby it feels like i'm dying now
[Outro]
I swear there's something better than gettin' off on sweet cocaine
It feels so good
It feels so good
Getting off the poverty train
Mornin'
