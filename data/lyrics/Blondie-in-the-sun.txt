[Intro]
Hm
Surf's up
[Verse 1]
In the sun, I'm waiting for the day
Having fun, and you're far away
Moonlight nights, water seems so clear
Ooh, city lights while I'm still waiting here
[Chorus]
In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love
[Verse 2]
New York isle is covered by gray
Concrete piles, blues play my way
Tropic haze, pineapple sky
Perfect wave, hurricane eye
[Chorus]
In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love
[Chorus]
In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love
[Outro]
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
