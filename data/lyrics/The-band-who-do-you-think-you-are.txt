When you look at me in the mirror
You're gettin' hard to recognize
You cover growin' up with tattoos and new shoes
And girls who don't know you're just a guy

You try to play along, they tell you that you've made it
You try to turn it on, even when you hate it
You're talkin' to yourself 'cause no one else will listen
Why do I feel different? I'm not any different, no

Who do, who do you think you are?
How, how did you get so far away from everything
You thought you'd be at seventeen?
I miss the innocent kid from Memphis that you used to be
'Cause I knew who you were back at the start
Now who do you think you are?

They don't know you like I know you
They don't see the things I see
You smile and sing like you're supposed to
I guess that's who you're supposed to be
But I'm not any different, no
Who do, who do you think you are?
How, how did you get so far away from everything
You thought you'd be at seventeen?
I miss the innocent kid from Memphis that you used to be
'Cause I knew who you were back at the start
Now who do you think you are?


Yeah, who do, who do you think you are?
How, how did you get so far away from everything
You thought you'd be at seventeen?
I miss the innocent kid from Memphis that you used to be
'Cause I knew who you were back at the start
Now who do you think you are?
