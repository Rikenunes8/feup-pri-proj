[Verse 1]
Not a day goes by I don't think about you
You left your mark on me, it's permanent, a tattoo
Pierce the skin and the blood runs through
Oh my baby
[Chorus]
The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me
[Verse 2]
I stand over the stove in the kitchen
Watch the water boil and I listen
Turn off the television
Oh my baby
[Chorus]
The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me
[Verse 3]
I take off my watch and my earrings
My bracelets and everything
Lie on my back and moan at the ceiling
Oh my baby[Verse 4]
Think about you and that long ride
I bite my nails, I get weak inside
Reach over and turn off the light
Oh my baby
[Chorus]
The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me
The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me
