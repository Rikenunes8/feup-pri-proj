[Verse 1]
Let's go away for a while, you and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
[Chorus 1]
Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
[Verse 2]
Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
We won't need them where we're going
We're going where the wind is blowing
Not knowing where we're gonna stay
[Chorus 2]
Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
[Bridge]
We will write a postcard to our
Friends and family in free verse
We will write a postcard to our
Friends and family in free verse
(On the road with Kerouac)
We will write a postcard to our
(Sheltered in his bivouac)
Friends and family in free verse
(On this road, we'll never die)
[Post-Chorus]
Heartbeat, heartbeat[Verse 1]
Let's go away for a while
You and I, to a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
[Chorus 3]
Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holi—
[Outro]
Let's go away, let's go away
(—day, far away, to stay)
Let's go away, let's go away
(On a holiday, far away, to stay)
In a heartbeat
