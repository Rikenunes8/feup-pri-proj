Yeah..
Ahh, yeah…
Ahh, yeah, this one's dedicated to all the ladies in the front, the back
All the older ladies out there
Lookin' nice, you know who you are
Hoo...
I need you, boomin' granny
I said, I want you, boomin' granny
Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny
Boomin' granny, good and plenty
Well, it might sound odd, it might sound corny
But here's some sex rhymes for those that are horny
For your boomin' granny with the boomin' system
Said I love ya, won't leave ya, so you got to listen
See I’m talkin' about the way that I’m feeling
You're so lovely, lengthy, and so appealing
A sassy, sophisticated, sexy lady
Well I’m 26 and you're 80
The clock is ticking so you better not front
We can go to my place or we could smoke a blunt
Well 
you're a golden girl, just like Bea Arthur
Just turn down the lights so we can go farther
Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny
Boomin' granny, good and plentyBecause I saw you at the check out line
You dropped your coupons and you were looking fine
Sophisticated, and so mature
I couldn't really care if you're 50 or 74
Because I want ya, and I need ya
Hey boomin' granny, you could be my teacher
And I could be your pet, bet
Listen old lady, I’m gonna make ya sweat
I know I’m younger, and you're much older
You look so nice on my Chevy Nova
I’m gonna take her to the low rider show, and flaunt ya
I gotta tell ya, lady
I said I want you boomin' granny
Because I need you, boomin' granny
Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny
Boomin' granny, good and plenty
