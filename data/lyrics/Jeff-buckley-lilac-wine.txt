[Part I]
[Verse 1]
I lost myself on a cool, damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
[Verse 2]
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
[Bridge]
When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
[Part II]
[Verse 3]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me? Nearly here
[Verse 4]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?
[Outro]
Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love
