[Verse]
Do you like good boogie?
Like a real boogie woogie
Hear the juke box singing
A-get the dance hall swinging
A-won't you grab my shaker
I got to meet your maker
Oh, get out the lead, get out of bed, get the lead out
[Chorus 1]
(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)
[Chorus 2]
Um, hey good looking
A-what you got there cooking?
You a young spring chicken
A-make your feet start kicking
[Bridge]
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
[Chorus 1]
(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)
[Chorus 2]
Um, hey good looking
A-what you got there cooking?
[Chorus 2]
Hey good looking
A-what you got there cooking
You a young spring chicken
A-make your feet start kicking
Boot it out, dance without me[Outro]
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
No-no, no-no
