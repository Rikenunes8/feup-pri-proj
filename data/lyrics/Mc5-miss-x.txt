Oh now
Yeah Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
See you lyin' here
You're so close
You're so near
Causing sensations rollin' through me
Comes on strong, feels just like a spell
Sensations rollin', turnin' from me to you
Causing this aura of heat to swirl
Your lips
Your undulating hips
Squeeze me oh so tight
Fulfill me through the night
Causing sensations rollin' through me
Comes on strong, feels just like a spell
Sensations rollin', turnin' from me to you
Causing this aura of heat to swirl
Yeah! Comes on strong

Comes on strong
Don't you know my blood is raging
Comes on strong
Darling, darling, darling, darling
Comes on strong
I'm tired of all my failings
Bring me close and burn, burn, burn, ha!
Heat gives way to sweat
My body's soaking wet
We slide and slip
From hip to lip
Causing sensations rollin' through me
Comes on strong, feels just like a spell
Sensations rollin', turnin' from me to you
Causing this aura of heat to swirlYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
