[Intro]
Dearest darling, dearest darling
Dearest darling, aey ohh
[Verse 1]
Don't you know the Lord above created you
Just for me to love
Picked you out from all the rest
Because he knew, I loved you best
Dearest darling, dearest darling
Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand
I once had a heart so thrill and true
But now it's gone from me to you
Take care of it like I have done
For you have two hearts and I have none
[Chorus]
Dearest oh, oh, oh, oh, darling
Dearest darling
Dearest, yeah yeah, dearest, yeah yeah[x2]
Darling, yeah yeah, darling, yeah yeah
[Bridge]
If I get to Heaven before you do
I'll try to make a hole and pull you through
[Chorus]
Woh, dearest, dearest
Dearest, dearest, aah
[Verse 2]
If I go to Heaven and you not there
I'm going to write your name on the Heavenly stair
If you aren't there by turn of day
Then I know baby you went the wrong way
[Chorus]
Woh, dearest, dearest
Woh, dearest, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh oh sweet baby
O sweet baby
