[Chorus]
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
[Verse 1]
Loving you, somehow I feel cheated
I ask, is this the way to be treated?
You take what you want
Then you stroll out the door contented
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me
[Chorus]
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
[Verse 2]
When we first met, I thought we were gonna be
The greatest love of all time
Oh, what a fantasy
I put faith in you and you shattered my dreams completely
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me
[Chorus]
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
