Katie's been gone since the spring time
She wrote one time'n sent her love
Katie's been gone for such a long time now
I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of
Dear Katie, If you can hear me
I can't wait to have ya near me
Dear Katie, since ya caught that bus
Well, I just don't know how things are with us
I'm still here and you're out there (somewhere)
Katie laughed when I said I was lonely
She said, there's no need t'feel that way
Katie said that I was her only one
But then I wonder why she didn't wanna stay
Dear Katie, if I'm the only one
How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't ya tell me straight
How much longer do I have to wait?
I believe you, but please come through
I know it's wrong to be apart this long
You should be here near me
Katie's been gone and now her face is
Slowly fading from my mind
She's gone to find some newer places
And left the old life far behindDear katie, don't ya miss your home?
I don't see why you had to roam
Dear katie, since you've been away
I lose a little something every day
I need you here, but you're still out there
Dear Katie, please drop me a line
Just write, love, tell me you're fine
Oh, Katie, if you can hear me
I just can't wait to have you near me
I can only think
Where are you, what ya do
Maybe there's someone new
