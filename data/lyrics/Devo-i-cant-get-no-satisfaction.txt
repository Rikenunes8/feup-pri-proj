[Chorus]
I can't get no
Satisfaction
I can't get me no
Satisfaction
And I try, and I try
And I try, t-t-t-try, try, try
I can't get no
I can't get me no
[Verse 1]
When I'm ridin' in my car
And a man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
[Refrain]
I can't get no
Uh, no, no, no
Uh, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
[Chorus]
I can't get no
Satisfaction
I can't get me no
Girly action
And I try, and I try
And I try, t-t-t-try, try, try
I can't get no
I can't get me no
[Verse 2]
When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts could be
But he can't be a man 'cause he does not smoke
The same cigarettes as me
[Refrain]
I can't get no
Uh, no, no, no
Uh, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say[Verse 3]
And when I'm flyin' 'round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm tryin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Better come back later next week
'Cause, you see, I'm on a losin' streak
[Refrain]
I can't get no
Uh, no, no, no
Uh, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
[Outro]
I can't get no (Satisfaction)
I can't get me no (Satisfaction)
I can't get no (Satisfaction)
I can't get me no (Satisfaction)
Oh, no, no, no, I can't get no (Satisfaction)
Oh, no, no, no, I can't get me no (Satisfaction)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (Satisfaction)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (Satisfaction)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (Satisfaction)
Oh, no, no, no, I can't get me no (Satisfaction)
Well, I can't get no (Satisfaction)
