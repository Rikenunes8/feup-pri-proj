[Verse 1]
Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone
[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl
[Verse 2]
I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl
[Bridge]
We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my woody, I would take you
Everywhere I go
[Verse 3]
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl
[Outro]
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
