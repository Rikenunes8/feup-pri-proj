[Verse]
Now, look what you've done[x4]
You left me here, the lonely one
And all I could say, is look what you've done
A broken heart, a weary mind
And [?] few dollars, baby, all the time
I once had a dream, but now I have none
You've taken your love and see what it done
The night bird cries, the shadow falls
Blue memories, and I recall
Your love is my life as warm as the sun
And nine years gone but see what you've done
Saw you last night, I was moving around
With your new toys, paint the town
But it is ok, keep having your fun
Because someday, you'll pay for all you've done
