[Verse 1]
I'm your mama
I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga
In the alley
, I'm your doctor
When in need, want some coke?
Have some weed, you know me
I'm your friend—your main boy
Thick and thin
[Chorus]
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Hahaha
[Verse 2]
Ain't I clean?
Bad machine, super cool
Super mean, feelin' good
For the man, super fly
Here I stand, secret stash
Heavy bread, baddest bitches
In the bed
[Chorus]
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusher, man[Bridge]
Silent life
Of crime
A man of odd circumstance
A victim of ghetto demands
Feed me money for style
And I'll let you trip for a while
Insecure from the past
How long can a good thing last?
Woohoo, oh, no
Got to be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow now
Pusherman gettin' mellow, y'all
[Verse 3]
Heavy mind
Heavy sign, makin' money
All the time, 
my 'El D'
And just me, for all junkies
To see, ghetto prince
Is my thing, makin' love's
How I swing
[Chorus]
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Huh, ha[Bridge 2]
"Two bags, please"
For a generous fee
Make your world
What you want it to be
Got a woman
I love desperately
Wanna give her somethin'
Better than me
Been told I can't be nothin' else
Just a hustler in spite of myself
I know I can break it
This life just don't make it
Lord, Lord, yeah
Got to get mellow now
Got to be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow now
[Verse 1]
I'm your mama
I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga
In the alley
, I'm your doctor
When in need, want some coke?
Have some weed, you know me
I'm your friend—your main boy
Thick and thin[Chorus]
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Your pusherman
[Outro]
Lord, Lord
It's all messed up
