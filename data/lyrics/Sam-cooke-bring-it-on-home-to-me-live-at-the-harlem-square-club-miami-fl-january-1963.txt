[Intro]
I want you to listen to this song right here for me
Got to tell you how I feel right now
This song gon' tell you how I feel
I know you've been gone away from me a long time, but listen, baby
[Verse 1]
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
[Chorus]
Oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
I gotta tell you this, baby
[Verse 2]
Don't you know that laughed, ha-ha-ha, when you left?
Oh, but I know that I only hurt myself
[Chorus]
Oh, why don't you bring it to me?
Bring that good loving, baby
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Listen, I gotta be a man to tell you this
Honey, look
[Verse 3]
I'll give you jewelry, I'll give you some of that monеy too
But listen, oh, that ain't all, that ain't all Sam will do for you
[Chorus]
All you gotta do is bring it to me
Bring that good loving, baby
Bring it on home to mе[Post-Chorus]
I gotta tell you this 'cause this is important
Listen to me
[Verse 4]
Don't you know that I'll always, I'll always be your slave, ha-ha
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave?
[Chorus]
But while I'm living, bring it to me
Bring that good loving, baby
Bring it on home to me
[Post-Chorus]
One more thing I gotta tell you
Listen to me right now
[Verse 5]
You know that I tried to treat you right
What did you do?
Oh, you stayed out, you just stayed out late at night
[Chorus]
I don't care who you was with, bring it to me
Bring all that good loving, baby
Bring it on—[Post-Chorus]
Everybody's with me
Everybody's with me tonight
Look, listen
[Bridge]
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, bring it to me
Bring that good loving
[Post-Chorus]
That sound pretty good to me
I want you to do that for me one more time
You gotta do that for me one more time
[Bridge]
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, bring it to me
Ha-ha-ha, I gotta leave that alone
And bring it on home to me
[Outro]
Yeah, bring it to me
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
To me
Bring it on home to me, baby
I need you
I'm kind of lonesome without you, you understand?
It's been a long time since you've been in my arms, darling
I've never stopped loving you
So why should you let a little misunderstanding stop you from loving me?
But I want you to know that whether or not you bring it on home to me, baby
I want you to know that nothing can change that love I have for you
Spend all of my money if you wanna, baby
But listen to me, ha-ha
Nothing can change that love I have for you, baby
Make me cry sometime
Oh, but listen
But nothing can change love I—
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Let me hear you say, oh, yeah
Say, oh, yeah
Nothing can change the love I have for you, baby
