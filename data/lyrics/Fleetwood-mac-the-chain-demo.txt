Slipped into the fountains of my emptiness
I let teardrops fall, I let them go
Stepped into the canyons of my loneliness
And I went about as far as I could go
Even as I searched for you, I knew
Even if I found you you'd be so cold
Even when I found you now baby I knew
That I'd gone about as far as I could go
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
I can still hear you saying
That if you don't love me now
You won't love me again
I don't mean to beg
But I don't know what else to say
If you meant what you said
You'd have been here yesterday
I won't watch you go
I won't even try
There you go down the road
But don't look to me to say goodbye
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You won't love me again
You won't love me again
Why don't you love me?
I'm down on my knees
Begging you to please...
Baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Baby please
Baby please
Baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
