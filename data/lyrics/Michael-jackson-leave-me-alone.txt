[Intro]
Aaow!
Hoo-hoo!
[Verse 1]
I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care, anyway
Time after time, I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby
All is goin' my way
[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?
[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around (Just stop doggin' me)
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
[Verse 2]
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ainâ€™t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?
[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Aaow!

('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know, girl

(And this choice you will take) (Stop it, baby)
Who's laughin', baby?
[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (Hee!) (Leave me alone, leave me alone)

[Outro]
Don't come beggin' me
Don't come beggin'
Don't come lovin' me
Don't come beggin'

I don't want it
I don't, I don't, I don't, I, aaow!
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Don't come beggin' me
Don't come beggin'
Don't come lovin' me
Don't come beggin'
I love you
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't love ya
