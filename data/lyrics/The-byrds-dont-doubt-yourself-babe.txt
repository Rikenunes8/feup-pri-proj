Don't doubt yourself, babe
Let your feet stand up for your beliefs, babe
I know what's running through your mind
Think you ought to capture time
Make love, walk the straight and narrow, aah aah
Don't doubt yourself, gal
Let what's inside be your guide, you know darn well
For all the wrong that's been done to you
It's making you prettier
So don't be blue
Life your living what you've been through, you're lucky, aah
Don't doubt yourself when
Daylight fades and darkness begins
It's only come to show you that you're the one
Who knows where it's at
The rest who think they've got it pat know nothing, aah
Don't doubt yourself cause
At the end of your words no one applaudes
The truth is proven to be found
Hard to take the first time around
So don't you worry, it's gonna be alright, aah, aah
