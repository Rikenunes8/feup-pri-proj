When I saw you that's when I knew
I'd lose my mind over you
When I held you that's when I knew
I'd lose my mind over you
When I saw you I realized somethin'
I didn't realize
You got somethin', you got somethin'
That makes me say child child child
When I saw you that's when I knew
I'd lose my mind, lose my mind
I'd lose my mind over you
