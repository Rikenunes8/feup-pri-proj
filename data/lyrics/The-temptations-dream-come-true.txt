[Verse 1]
I don't care where you came from
Oh no, I don't care where you've been
All I know is that I love you
And I'm going to love you 'til the end
(Gonna love you until the end)
[Chorus]
'Cause you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
[Verse 2]
For every hand there's a glove
For every, for every heart there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)
[Chorus]
'Cause you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
[Outro]
Yes, you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
(Better than anyone, better than anyone)
I love you (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before (Better than anyone before)
A-do me right because I love you (Better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before (Better than anyone before)
Baby (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before (Better than anyone before)
Oh (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
Do me right because I love you (Better than anyone)
