[Verse 1]
Do I, do I
Belong to the night?
Only, only
Only tonight
All the ladies
Stay inside
Time may freeze
A world could cry
All this night
Running loud
I hear the whispers
And I hear the shouts
And though they never
Cry for help
[Verse 2]
Tell me who sends these
Infamous gifts
To make such a promise
And make such a slip
Oh, no
Can't pull a trick
Never the rose
Without the prick
Oh, but tell me
How do I say?
I woke up
And it's yesterday
Do I again
Face this night?[Chorus]
Guiding light, guiding light
Guiding through these nights
[Verse 3]
Darling, darling
Do we part like the seas?
The roaring shells
The drifting of the leaves
But all intent
Remains unknown
It's time to sit up
Sit up in the throne
You've seen before
But it's always new
So look close
And see who's come through
Never again
To face this night
[Chorus]
Guiding light, guiding light
Guiding through these nights
