It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Yes, a long, long, long, long time before the dawn

Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say
You know that somethin' is goin' on around here
It surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day, no
And it appears to be a long (Yes it does)
Appears to be a long (Mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long time before the dawn

Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness
You got to speak your mind, if you dare
But don't—no, don't no—try to get yourself elected
If you do you had better cut your hair, mm

And it appears to be a long (Yes it does)
Appears to be a long (Mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn, yeah

It's been a (Long) long (Time) time (Comin') comin'
It's going to be (Long) a long (Time) time (Gone) gone
But you know the darkest hour
Is always, always just before the dawn

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn
