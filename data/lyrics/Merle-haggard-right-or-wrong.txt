[Verse]
Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same old regret
[Verse]
All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart, please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you
[Verse]
Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same old regret
[Verse]
All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true, oh Lord
In your heart, please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you
