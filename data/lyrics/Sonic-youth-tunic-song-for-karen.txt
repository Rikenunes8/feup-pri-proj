[Verse 1]
Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me
Hey, what are you waiting for? Feeding, feeding me?
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in the mirror and I'm bigger in every way
[Chorus]
She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
[Post-Chorus 1]
I'm in heaven now, I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye Downey,
 
hello Janis
Hello Dennis, Elvis, and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end
[Verse 2]
Dreaming, dreaming of how it was supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way
[Chorus]
She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
[Post-Chorus 2]
Hey mom, look I'm up here, I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad, the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said "Honey, you look so under-fed"
[Instrumental Bridge][Verse 3]
Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes and I'm bigger in every way
[Chorus]
She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
[Verse 4]
Goodbye Richard, gotta go now
I'm finally on my own, but Dan's got a gig
Keep the love lights glowing,
 
little girl's got the blues
I can still hear mama say
"Honey, don't let it go to your head"
