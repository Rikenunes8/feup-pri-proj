[Verse 1]
Well, early in the morning
'Til late at night
I got a poison headache
But I feel alright
[Refrain]
I’m pledgin' my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too
[Verse 2]
Well, the hobo got too high
And he came to me naturally
He stole my baby
Then he wanted to steal me
[Refrain]
And I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too
[Verse 3]
Won’t you come with me, baby?
I’ll take you where you want to go
And if it don’t work out
You’ll be the first to know[Refrain]
I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too
[Verse 4]
Well, the room is so stuffy
I can hardly breathe
Everybody's gone, but me and you
And I can’t be the last to leave
[Refrain]
I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too
[Verse 5]
Well they sent for the ambulance
And one was sent
Somebody got lucky
But it was an accident
[Refrain]
I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too
