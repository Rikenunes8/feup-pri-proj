I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
Never found anything else to do
But waiting for you
I've been calling your name
I've been calling your name
Never found anything else to say
Nothing to say
You can kill a lot of time if you really want put your mind do it
Leave it all behind if you never wanna go through it
I keep hearing your name
I keep hearing your name
Nothing else sounds the same
As hearing your name
You can kill a lot of time if you really put your mind to it
Or leave it all behind and never ever go through it
I've been hoping for you
Keep hoping for you
What else can I do
But keep hoping for you?
You can kill a lot of time if you really want put your mind to it
Or leave it all behind and never ever go through it
We can kill a lot of time and never really have to go through it
What else can I do
But keep hoping for you?
