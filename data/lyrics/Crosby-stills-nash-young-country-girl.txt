Winding paths through tables and glass
First fall was new
Now watch the summer pass
So close to you

Too late to keep the change
Too late to pay
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave
No pass out sign on the
Door set me thinking
Are waitresses paying the
Price of their winking
While stars sit at bars and
Decide what they're drinking
They drop by to die 'cause
It's faster than sinking

Too late to keep the change
Too late to pay
No time to stay the same
Too late to keep the change
Too late to pay
No time to stay the same
Too young to leave

Find out that now was the
Answer to answers
That you gave later
She did the things that we
Both did before now
But who forgave her?
If I could stand to see her crying
I would tell her not to care
When she learns of all your lyin'
Will she join you there?

Country girl I think you're pretty
Got to make you understand
Have no lovers in the city
Let me be your country man
Got to make you understand
Got to make you understand
Country girl
