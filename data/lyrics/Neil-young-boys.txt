We used to be so calm
Now I think of you all night long
'Cause you've been with another man
There you are and here I am

And I know we should be free
But freedom's a prison to me
'Cause I lied to keep it kind
When I left you far behind
And love became removed
As I wrote that guilty note
And it drove you far away
L.A. girls and ocean boys
How did we come to share our joys
With L.A. girls and ocean boys

It's a special kind of love
That it takes to rise above
Like this love I have for you
And I still believe it's true
Yes, I still believe it's true
I still believe it's true
