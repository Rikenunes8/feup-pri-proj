It might cost you a little cash
A little time, a tank of gas
To drive right past your hometown
Find that house you first fell in love in
It might take you a couple weeks
To save for a trip down to the Keys
With all your friends from way back when
That's a tab I don't mind paying

Some might say that money makes the world go 'round
But they ain't here with you and me right now
Underneath this burning skyline
Waiting for the day to turn to stars
All the gold in California
Ain't close to what I got in my arms
Lord knows land and luck
And pick-up trucks
And diamonds don't come cheap
Thank God, love and sunsets are free

Just like an old tree
I carved our names in this guitar
That we picked up at a pawn shop
On a snowy day in Denver
We slеpt out in a million stars
What you got ain't who you are
It's things like thesе that pay the most
That's all you got to give 'em

I don't believe that money makes the world go 'round
'Cause you can't buy the way I feel right now

Underneath this burning skyline
Waiting for the day to turn to stars
All the gold in Dahlonega
Ain't what I got in my arms
Lord knows land and luck
And pick-up trucks
And diamonds don't come cheap
Thank God, love and sunsets are free
There's a freedom in your eyes right now
That makes up for everything I've lost
Like every hero's price they pay
To be safe right here, don't worry
Like the colors of Old Glory, we won't fade

Underneath this burning skyline
Waiting for the day to turn to stars
All the gold in Dahlonega
Ain't what I got in my arms
Lord knows land and luck
And pick-up trucks
And diamonds don't come cheap
Thank God, for faith and family
Thank God, what they mean to me
Thank God, love and sunsets are free
