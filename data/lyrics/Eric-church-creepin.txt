[Intro]
Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
[Verse 1]
Like a honeybee beating on my screen door
I got a little buzz and my head is sore
And from my bed I can feel the sun
Lord I hear the morning come
[Pre-Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Verse 2]
You shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun
A flip of a switch
A thief on the run
And since the day you left me baby
I can feel the lonely
I can hear the crazy
[Pre-Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Chorus]
Head for the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December
[Pre-Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Verse 3]
[Album version:] Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love
[Music video version:] Your caffeine kiss and nicotine love
Got under my skin and into my blood
That need you back comes over me
Like ivy crawling up a hickory tree[Pre-Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Chorus]
Head to the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December
[Chorus]
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
[Outro]
Break it down, down, down, down
Just last night I saw the light
At the end of that tunnel on the other side
Thought I found my way outta this pain
Only to find your memory train
Creeping, creeping, creeping, creeping
[Outro]
Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
