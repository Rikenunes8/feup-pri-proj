[Verse 1]
I will try not to breathe
I can hold my head still with my hands at my knees
These eyes are the eyes of the old
Shivering and fold
I will try not to breathe
This decision is mine
I have lived a full life
And these are the eyes that I want you to remember
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I need something to fly over my grave again
I need something to breathe
[Verse 2]
I will try not to burden you
I can hold these inside
I will hold my breath
 until all these shivers subside
Just look in my eyes
I will try not to worry you
I have seen things that you will never see
Leave it to memory me
I shudder to breathe
[Chorus]
I want you to remember
Oh (You'll never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (You'll never see)
I need something to breathe (Something to breathe)
Baby, don't shiver now
Why do you shiver now? (I have seen things you will never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (I have seen things you will never see)
I need something to breathe
[Verse 3]
I will try not to worry you
I have seen things that you will never see
Leave it to memory me
Don't dare me to breathe[Chorus]
I want you to remember
Oh (You'll never see)
I need something to fly (Something to fly)
Over my grave again (You'll never see)
I need something to breathe (Something to breathe)
Baby, don't shiver now
Why do you shiver? (I have seen things you will never see)
I need something to breathe (Something to breathe)
(I have seen things you will never see)
I want you to remember
