[Chorus]
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?
[Verse 1]
Hear the sea spray give
I was with her
We’re under the ship so get me over
Now that was me
Listen
Now she fishes
Now listen
There was no-one out there we used
It's the news for me
Useless
Now so much waste
How we’ll be teased
[Chorus]
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?[Verse 2]
Won’t you just ask me
You’re an imbecile
What’s the matter, for everyone I feel
Pain
Blues singer
He’s playing just a guitar
From the top
I wake, I still look I feel loose
We’re all here now
Who’s the first ease into my heart
He must be one of us
[Chorus]
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?
