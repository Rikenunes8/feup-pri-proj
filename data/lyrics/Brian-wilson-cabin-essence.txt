[Verse 1]
Light the lamp and fire mellow

Welcomes the time for a change

Lost and found, you still remain there
You'll find a meadow filled with grain there
I'll give you a home on the range

[Verse 3]
I want to watch you windblown facing
Waves of wheat for your embracing
Folks sing a song of the grange

Nestle in a kiss below there
The constellations ebb and flow there
And witness our home on the range
