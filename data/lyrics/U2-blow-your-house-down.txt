(One, two, three, four)
[Verse 1]
You’ve been along this road so many times
Nothing should be a surprise to you
Seen every premeditated crime
From every possible point of view
Why, why
If it’s so wrong does it feel so right?
Why, why
Though I’m glad you’re gone do I want you tonight?
[Chorus]
She, she’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna turn your head around
She’s gonna blow your house down
[Verse 2]
What of chaos is the thing you crave
Is it the taste of self-inflicted pain?
And what of losing is your drug of choice
Is it what gets you coming back again?
Why, why
If it’s so wrong does it feel so right?
[Chorus]
She, she’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna turn your head around
She’s gonna blow your house down
She…blow your house down
She’s gonna turn your head around
She’s gonna blow your house down
[Interlude]
Run fast, fast as you can
Run as fast as fast as you can
Run as fast as fast as you can
Run as fast as fast as you can
Fast as you can
Run as fast, fast as you can[Bridge]
You’re raving, is she worth saving
What makes you think you can?
You're left making deals for breaking
WIth your own devil’s hand
[Chorus]
She, she’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna turn your head around
She’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna turn your head around
She’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna blow your house down
She’s gonna turn your head around
She’s gonna blow your house down
