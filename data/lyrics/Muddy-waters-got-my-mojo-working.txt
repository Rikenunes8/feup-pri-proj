[Verse 1]
Got my 
mojo
 working but it just won't work on you
Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you
I want to love you so bad, I don't know what to do
[Verse 2]
Going down to Louisiana to get me a 
mojo hand
Going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm going to have all you women, 
getcha under my command
[Chorus]
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
I got a gypsy woman giving me advice
I got a gypsy woman giving me advice
I got a whole lot of tricks keeping here on ice
