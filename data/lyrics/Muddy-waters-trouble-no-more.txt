[Verse]
Can't tell how long you're gone, can't tell how long you stay
It's good country fun, it's your home some day
Someday baby, isn't no trouble for me, anymore
Ah keep on dancing baby, let me dance one dance
Well I know when I go, I'm living too fast. Someday
I'll tell him about it, in my neighborhood
Going to tell that little woman, that she don't do me no good. Someday
I know you're leaving, and your coming back home
Oh, without my loving lady, I can't stay long. Someday
Good Bye baby, ah take my hand
Don't want no woman no, which doesn't have no man
Someday baby, you ain't going t trouble poor me, anymore
