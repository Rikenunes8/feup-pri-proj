[High Vocal Loop]
Every time I see your face
I get all wet between my legs
Every time you pass me by
I heave a sigh of pain
[Verse 1]
Every time I see your face
I think of things unpure unchaste
I want to fuck you like a dog
I'll take you home and make you like it
[Verse 2]
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you ever thought of
Is everything I'll do to you
I'll fuck you and your minions too
[Verse 3]
Your face reminds me of a flower
Kind of like you're underwater
Hair's too long and in your eyes
Your lips a perfect suck me size
[Verse 4]
You act like you're fourteen years old
Everything you say is so
Obnoxious, funny, true, and mean
I want to be your blowjob queen
[Verse 5]
You're probably shy and introspective
That's not part of my objective
I just want your fresh young jimmy
Jamming, slamming, ramming in me
[Verse 1]
Every time I see your face
I think of things unpure unchaste
I want to fuck you like a dog
I'll take you home and make you like it[Verse 2 Modified]
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you ever thought of
Is everything I'll do to you
I'll fuck you 'til your dick is blue
