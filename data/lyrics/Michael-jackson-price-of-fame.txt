[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain
[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain
[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
[Verse 2]
I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move
[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
And I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain
[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' this way, boy[Instrumental Break]
Hee-hee
Aow!
Do it, ooh!
[Verse 3]
I like to take some time and get away, then they say
Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really start takin' pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Well then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues
[Chorus]
Itâ€™s the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' no pain, boy
