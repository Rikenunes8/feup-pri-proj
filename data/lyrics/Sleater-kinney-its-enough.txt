Baby got a record
Taking me home
Play it loud
When you're all alone
Hear me singin
Hear this song
Hear my voice
In your favorite song
Enough it's enough
If you want it that much
It's enough
Can't hear nothin
But that sound
It is what you want
Are you ready
Let's go
Hit the floor
Shake it baby
A little more
I make
Rock and roll
