Let's burn down the cornfield
Let's burn down the cornfield
And we can listen to it burn
You hide behind the oak tree
You hide behind the oak tree
Stay out of danger 'till I return
Oh, it's so good
On a cold night
To have a fire
Burnin' warm and bright
You hide behind the oak tree
You hide behind the oak tree
Stay out of danger 'till I return
Let's burn down the cornfield
Let's burn down the cornfield
And I'll make love to you while it's burning
