[Verse 1]
Out on some borderline
Some mark of in between
I lay down golden in time and woke up vanishing
[Verse 2]
Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time you must be laughing
[Verse 3]
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change, you must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing
[Verse 4]
Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power, ideals and beauty fading in everyone's hands
[Verse 5]
Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning and the sky forever rushing
[Verse 6]
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
[Outro]
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
