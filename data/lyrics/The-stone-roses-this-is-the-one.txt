[Verse 1]
A girl consumed by fire
We all know her desire
From the plans that she has made
I have her on a promise
Immerse me in your splendor
All the plans that I have made
[Chorus]
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
She's waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one she's waited for
[Verse 2]
I'd like to leave the country
For a month of Sundays
Burn the town where I was born
If only she'd believe me
Bellona, belladonna
Burn me out or bring me home
[Chorus]
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one she's waited for
And this is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one I've waited for
[Bridge]
Oh, this is the one (Oh, this is the one)
This is the one
This is the one I've waited for
[Chorus]
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one I've waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one I've waited for[Bridge 2]
It may go right
But it might go wrong
This is the one
This is the one she's waited for
[Chorus]
And this is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one I've waited for
[Outro]
And this is the one
Oh, this is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one I've waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
