[Verse 1]
There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them, life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours, you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him, He'll give you peace of mind
[Chorus]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
[Verse 2]
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to Him anytime, He's always around
[Chorus]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
[Verse 3]
Well, He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls
[Chorus]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God, He cares (I know he does)
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
[Outro]
