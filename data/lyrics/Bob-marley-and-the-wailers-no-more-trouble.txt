Make love and not war! 'Cause we don't need no trouble

To guide and protect us on (on)
If you hope good down from above (love)
Help the weak if you are strong now (strong)

Lord knows, we don't need no trouble!

We don't need, no more trouble, we don't need no more trouble!
Troubles, we don't need (we don't need), Lord, knows!
We don't need no more war (no more trouble)!
No more trouble, we don't need no more, more trouble!
