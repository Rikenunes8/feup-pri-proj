Help the poor, won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby listen to my plead
I need you so much, I need your care
Need all the loving baby you can spare
Help the poor, oh baby, won't you help poor me
Say you will, say you'll help me on
I can't make it no further in this world alone
Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes
For your loving don't you realize
I need help, oh baby, help poor me
You are my inspiration
You could make me be a king
But if you don't come to my rescue
I couldn't ever be anything
Help the poor, won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby listen to my plead
Well I lost my courage till I found you
You got what it takes baby to pull me through
Help the poor, oh baby, won't you help poor me
I'm in trouble don't you see
Only your love can save me
Help the poor, help the poor
Help the poor
Help the poor
Help the poor
