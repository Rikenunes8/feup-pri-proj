[Chorus]
I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drowning me out
I want to sing that rock and roll
[Verse 1]
I want to reach that glory land
I want to shake my savior's hand
[Chorus]
And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drowning me out
I want to sing that rock and roll
[Verse 2]
I been a-traveling near and far
But I want to lay down my old guitar
[Chorus]
And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drowning me out
I want to sing that rock and roll
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I been a-traveling near and far
But I want to lay down my old guitar
[Chorus]
And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drowning me out
I want to sing that rock and roll[Outro]
I want to sing that rock and roll
