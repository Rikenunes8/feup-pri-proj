[Verse 1]
The streets are lined with 
camera crews
Everywhere he goes is news
Today is different, today is not the same
Today 
I make the action
, 
take snapshot
 
into the light
Snapshot
 into the light, 
I'm shooting
 into the light
[Verse 2]
Four miles down the 
cavalcade
 moves on
Driving into the sun
If I worked it out right, 
they won't see me or the gun
Two miles to go, they're clearing the road
And the cheering has really begun
I've got my radio
, I can hear what's going on
[Bridge]
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
All you people in TV land
I will wake up your 
empty shells
Peak-time viewing 
blown in a flash
As I burn into your memory cells
'Cause I'm alive
[Verse 3]
They're coming around the corner with the bikers at the front
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes
It's a matter of time, a matter of will
And the governor's car is not far behind, he's not the one I've got in mind
'Cause there he is, the man of the hour, standing in the limousine
[Bridge]
I don't really hate you, I don't care what you do
We were made for each other, me and you
I want to be somebody, you were like that too
If you don't get given you learn to take
And I will take you
Holding my breath
Release the catch
And I let the bullet fly[Outro]
All turned quiet, I have been here before
A lonely boy hiding behind the front door
Friends have all gone home
There's my toy gun on the floor
Come back, Mum and Dad
You're growing apart, you know that I'm growing up sad
I need some attention
I shoot into the light
