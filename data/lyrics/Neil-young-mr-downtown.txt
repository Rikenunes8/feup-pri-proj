On the hill where Custer was making his last stand
With the Indians all around him and his gun in his hand
Such a wind was blowing that day through the battleground
I could feel it in my hair as I turned towards downtown
Weaving through the buildings, cutting though the streets
Slicing through the culture, piling on the weeks

Goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home, I'm goin' home

Dropping in on you, my friend, is just like old times
Said the fool who signed the paper to assorted slimes
It's hard to get blood from a stone but for you I'll give it a try
To provide your accommodations and leave you satisfied
You'd think it was easy to give your life away
To not have to live up to the promises you made

Goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home


Elusively she cut the phone and went from cell to cell
Really looking remarkable and obviously doing well
She made a turn on a wooden bridge into the battleground
With a thousand warriors on the ridge, she tried to turn her radio down
Battle drums were pounding all around her car
She saw her clothes were changing into sky and stars

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home, I'm goin' home

Goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home, I'm goin' home
Goin' home, I'm goin' home
