[Intro]
Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
[Verse 1]
From the early, early morning
To the early, early night
When you caught Miss Molly
Rocking at the House of Blue Lights
[Chorus]
Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
[Verse 2]
Momma, Papa told me
"Son, you better watch your step"
If they knew about Miss Molly
I'd have to watch my pa myself
[Chorus]
Good Golly Miss Molly
 sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
Ahhhhh!
[Saxophone Solo]
[Chorus]
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
[Verse 3]
Going to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you hug me and kiss me
Make me ting-a-ling-a-ling[Chorus]
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
