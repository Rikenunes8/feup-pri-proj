[Verse 1]
Sitting in my car outside your house
(Sitting in my car outside your house)
Remember when you spilled coke all over you blouse
T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs
(T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs)
We've been having fun all summer long
(All summer long you've been with me)
I can't see enough of you
(All summer long we've both been free)
[Chorus]
Won't be long until summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now
[Verse 2]
Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
(Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills)
When we rode the horse we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
[Chorus]
Won't be long until summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now
[Outro]
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
