When I'm getting home to you
I gotta show you what I can do
But everything connects, and that ain't nowhere
Well, but maybe they're just giving you all you've ever wanted
And maybe you never ever know what that was
And maybe you're just finding it out now
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Technology satellite, well
What's wrong today and why was
Everyone so busy they've forgotten why they're playing
That he said, what's wrong today is what wrong with you
You're so solid, busy solid, that's all you do
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Your pretty little mind
Catch me your slaves, shot at
Every riffle on the way and I gotta
Show you more mustard gas
 than any girl ever seen
Since I been blasted, I've been blown, I've been backing away
You've got to back it away
You've got to take a search of values, yeah
But I've got a concert out to play
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Your pretty little mind
Your pretty little mind
When I'm getting home to you
I've got to show you what I can do
But everything connects, and that ain't nowhere
No no no, baby, no nowhere
It just won't give a no
I'm talking about your overture
Talking 'bout your overture
Got to shout about your overture
Now that it's over, now that it's over
Now that it's over, what ya gonna do?
