[Verse 1]
Go, go, go, go, now
Out of the nest
, it's time
Go, go, go, now
Circus girl without a safety net
Here, here, now, don't cry
You raised your hand for the assignment
Tuck those ribbons under
Your helmet
, be a good soldier
[Pre-Chorus]
First my left foot
Then my right behind the other
Pantyhose running in the cold
[Chorus]
Mother, the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Green limousine for the 
redhead
Dancing, dancing girl
And when I dance for him
Somebody leave the light on
Just in, just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come from
[Verse 2]
I walked into your dream
And now I've forgotten
How to dream my own dream
You are the clever one, aren't you?
Brides in veils for you
We told you all of our secrets
All but one, now don't you even try
The phone has been disconnected
[Pre-Chorus]
Dripping with blood
And with time and with your advice
Poison me against the moon
[Chorus]
Mother, the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Black Chariot for the 
redhead
Dancing, dancing girl
He's gonna change my name
Maybe he'll leave the light on
Just in, just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come from[Bridge]
I escape into, your escape into
Our very favorite fearscape
It's across the sky
And across my heart
And I cross my legs
Oh my God
[Pre-Chorus]
First my left foot
Then my right behind the other
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow
[Chorus]
Mother
Mother, the car is here
Here, maybe, maybe he'll leave the light on
For the, for the, for the dancing girl
He's gonna change my name
Maybe he'll leave the light
Just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come, come from
[Outro]
Mother, mother, mother
