One, two
Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song
Out to my main homey, Mike D
A'ight, let's kick it
Ready... go
Get on the mic, get-get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!
Let's be real, and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are 
rope
, an emcee you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic, and let's show them like we used to
Well, you say fuck that, yo, Holmes, fuck this
I'm the King AdWhammy 
and you're Dick Butkus
One half science and another half soul
Nicknamed Mike D, not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got busy in 'Frisco, fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girlie 'cause you know she never says no
So just get on the mic, just get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!
Well, Mike D is a special individual
Pullin' out knots 
and pullin' in residuals
Go to the movies, get the Rolos
The cholos ridin' slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo
Mike, my stromy, don't be so selfish
Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish
{At the fever}
