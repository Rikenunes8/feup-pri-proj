[Verse 1]
Do you remember the last time I said
If I ever thought of lying
I'd rather think of dying instead?
And maybe you remember the last time you called me
To say we were through
How it took a million tears
Just to prove they all were for you
But those days are through
[Chorus]
'Cause it wouldn't have made any difference
If you loved me, how could you love me?
When it wouldn't really make any difference
If you really loved me, you just didn't love me
[Verse 2]
'Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be
In the most unfaithful arms that you always picture me
And maybe you remember that
Though I can't always show proof I was true
No one else could change my mind
Or stop me coming home to you
But those days are through
[Chorus]
'Cause it wouldn't have made any difference
If you loved me, how could you love me?
When it wouldn't really make any difference
If you really loved me, you just didn't love me
[Bridge]
Enough to believe me (enough to believe me)
Enough not to leave me (enough not to leave me)
Enough not to look for a reason to be unhappy with me
And make me regret ever wanting you
But those days are through
[Chorus]
'Cause it wouldn't have made any difference
If you loved me, how could you love me?
When it wouldn't really make any difference
If you really loved me, you just didn't love me[Outro]
'Cause it wouldn't have made any difference
If you loved me, how could you love me?
When it wouldn't really make any difference...
