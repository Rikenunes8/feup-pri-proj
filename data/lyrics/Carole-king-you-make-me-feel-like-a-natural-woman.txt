[Verse 1]
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
[Verse 2]
Oh when my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
[Chorus]
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
[Bridge]
Oh, baby, what you've done to me (What you've done to me)
You make me feel so good inside (Good inside)
And I just wanna be (Wanna be)
Close to you
You make me feel so alive
[Chorus]
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural, natural woman
You make me feel
You know you make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
You know you, you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
Natural woman
