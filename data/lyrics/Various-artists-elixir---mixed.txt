(I see the way you watch...)

Better hold your
Breath (Breath)
Don't say a prayer for me
Leave me to rest (Leave me to rest)
Drink half an OE then fill it with OJ and drink up the rest (Drink up the rest)
I am alone
I, I, I, I want a place to call home (Place to call home)
Ayy
You're not alone
I weep a lot more than I like to show
Sick of givin' a fuck about the number of times somebody click a bunch of words in blue on top of a line
I never wanted to be a slave to vanity but now look at me I'ma piece of daddy I never wanted to be and I'm
Tryna find my way to the top of a mountain
But I cannot escape here alive
Maybe I'ma die all alone in the fountain
Although you cut me and left me to die
Blackmage
Tat on my face
Black balaclava it cover my face
Burn sage
All in this place
Cleansin' and washin' away all the hate
John Dee
Reincarnated
I'm Aleister Crowley on his worst of days
Stay away
All of you bitches that want me to slay you but can't take the pain
(I don't worship Satan I'm just sayin' that we get along)
When I was a lil jit I used to think that I was never gonna ever be shit (Gonna ever be shit)
Now I'm grown
And I still don't know which way I'm goin'
Life's a bitch, ayy
When I am gone (Gone)
Summon my soul
Tie me to the floor
Don't let me go (Go)
Do what you want
I'm one with my ghost
(Fuck! Fuck!)
I don't got a thing that I wouldn't leave to be 6 feet deep
Find me a top of a mountain and let me just conjure up something to help me
"Every minute that passes us by is an eternity of wasted time
By the light that takes but a million years to reach the terrestrial surface from some distant star
I will behold the Philosopher's stone"
