[Chorus]
He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't do the wild things that he did before
[Verse 1]
(Oh)
He used to act bad
Used to, but he quit it
It makes me so sad, because I know that he did it for me (and I can see)
And I can see (still in the street) his heart, his heart is out in the street
[Chorus]
He don't comb his hair like he did before
He don't wear those dirty old black boots no more
[Verse 2]
(Oh)
But he's not the same
There's something about his kisses that tells me he's changed
I know there's something missing inside
(Tell me more)
Something died
(Still in the street)
His heart, his heart is out in the streets
He grew up on the sidewalk, streetlights shining above
He grew up with no one to love
He grew up on the sidewalk, he grew up running free
He grew up and then he met me
[Chorus]
He don't hang around with the gang no more
Gee, he doesn't smile like he did before
[Break
(Oh)
I wish I didn't care
I wish I'd never met him[Verse 3]
They're waiting out there, so I got to set him free
(Send him back)
He's got to be
(out in the street)
His heart, his heart is out in the street
[Outro]
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(He's out in the street)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(He's out in the street)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(He's out in the street)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(He's out in the street)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
