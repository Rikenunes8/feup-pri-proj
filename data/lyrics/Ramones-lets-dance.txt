[Verse 1]
Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance?
[Chorus]
Well let's dance; let's dance
We'll do the Twist, the stomp, the Mashed Potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
But let's dance, well let's dance
[Verse 2]
Hey baby, yeah, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't you let me go
[Chorus]
Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the Twist, the stomp, the Mashed Potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance, well let's dance
(Okay, wait a minute)
[Verse 3]
Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home
[Chorus]
Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the Twist, the stomp, the Mashed Potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance, well let's dance
[Verse 4]
Hey, baby, things are swingin' right
Yes, I know that tonight'a the night
[Chorus]
Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the Twist, the stomp, the Mashed Potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance, well let's dance[Outro]
Well let's dance
Well let's dance
Well let's dance
