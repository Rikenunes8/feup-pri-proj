[Verse 1]
Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
Roaming suburban boys
Mother's got her hairdo to be done
She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
In this suburban Hell
And in the distance a police car
To break the suburban spell
[Chorus]
Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
[Verse 2]
Break the window by the town hall
Listen, a siren screams
There in the distance like a roll call
Of all the suburban dreams
[Chorus]
Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
[Bridge]
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
It's on the front page of the papers:
"This Is Their Hour of Need"
Where's a policeman when you need one
To blame the colour TV?[Chorus]
Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
[Chorus]
Take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
[Outro]
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia
