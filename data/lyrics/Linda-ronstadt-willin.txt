[Verse 1]
I been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know, but I'm still willin'
Out on the road late last night
I'd see my pretty Alice in every headlight, Alice, Dallas Alice
[Chorus]
And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites and wine
And you show me a sign
And I'll be willin' to be movin'
[Verse 2]
And I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
Had my head stove in, but I'm still on my feet and I'm still willin'
And I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico, ah, but I'm still
[Chorus]
And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites and wine
And you show me a sign
And I'll be willin' to be movin'
