[Verse 1]
You might think I'm crazy, but I'm serious
It's better you know now
What I thought was happiness was only part time bliss
You can take a bow
It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right and I said wrong which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing
[Chorus]
Oh, my meters running, so I've got to go now
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-oh
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
It's true you want to build your life on guarantees
Hey, take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I'm not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me
This has become an all too familiar scene
It's not the first time I paid the fare
Where'd you get the idea of material possession?
Thank you for the ride, nowhere
[Chorus]
And oh, my meters running, so I've really got to go
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-hoo
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-oh, ah
It's the pleasure principle oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, ah-ah
[Bridge]
I know, what you mean to me
Baby, this is nowhere
You know, what became between you and me
Human differential
Di-da, di, da-da
It's the principle of pleasure
(Oh-oh-ah) It's the pleasure principle, principle (Oh-oh-ah)
[Bridge 2]
You might say, that I'm no good for you
I wouldn't trust your looks, baby, if I could
I got so many, things I wanna do, before I'm through
Hey, yay, di-da, di, da-da
It's the pleasure principle, it's the pleasure principle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's the pleasure principle[Outro]
Baby, you can't hold me down
Baby, you can't hold me down
After all the love that we've been through
After all you've put me through
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah (Oh-oh)
Love me, hey, yeah, love me, ooh-ooh
It's the pleasure principle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
