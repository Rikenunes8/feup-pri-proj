[Verse]
Oh, true fine mama, she's really on the ball
Yes, true fine mama, she's really on the ball
She hears my every plea, comes to my beck and call
Oh, come back, baby, don't leave me here
Whoo, come back, baby, don't leave me here
You know that I love you, don't disappear
[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
You know that I love you, every night and day
[Chorus]
Well, singing, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
(Honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, true fine mama, don't go away
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
You know that I love you, every night and day
[Chorus]
Well, I'm singing, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
