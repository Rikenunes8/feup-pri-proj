[Chorus]
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me, baby, I'm your lover man, oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night, oh baby, do you wanna dance?
[Post-Chorus]
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance ?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
[Chorus]
Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night, oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night, oh baby, do you wanna dance?
[Post-Chorus]
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance ?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance ?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance ?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance ?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
