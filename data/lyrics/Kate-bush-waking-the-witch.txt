I question your innocence
She's a witch!
This blackbird!
There's a stone around my leg
Ha! Damn you, woman
Help this blackbird!
There's a stone around my leg
What say you, good people?!
"Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!"
Well, are you responsible for your actions?
This blackbird!
"Not guilty!"
Help this blackbird!
Wake the witch[Outro]
"Get out of the waves!"
"Get out of the water!"
