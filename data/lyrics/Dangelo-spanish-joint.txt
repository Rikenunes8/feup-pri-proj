[Verse 1]
Whenever it rains, I feel this way
A little somethin' to get me through this day, yeah
Give me a little that, no time flat, yeah
Gonna be a good thing, yeah, yeah
Serene but in need of feelin' free
Lettin' go and landin' on my feet, yeah
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat, yeah (Oh, oh)
Gonna be a good thing, yeah (Oh)
[Chorus]
Well, people believe this sayin' is true (Oh, do you believe the sayin' is true?)
Whatever will be, will forever do (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full (Oh)
I ain't got nothin' (Got nothin') to do with you[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Check it out
[Verse 2]
Gotta get out, gotta get out of here
I'm in the dark and the light looks sincere, yeah
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat, yeah
Gonna be a good thing, oh-woah
All you do is complain about your pain, yeah
And the cloud that follows you won't cease to rain, yeah
Don't look back, handle that, yeah
Make it into a good thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Somethin' in me's gotta be (Mm)
Sole controller in control of me (Oh-oh, oh, yeah)
A link in your chain just won't do (Just won't do, oh, yeah)
I don't want nothin' to do with you (Oh-woah)
[Guitar Interlude]

Oh-oh-oh
Huh, uh

Mm, mm-mm

Yeah, yeah[Verse 4]
Somethin' stirrin' inside of me's (Oh me's) gotta be (Oh, yeah)
Sole controller in control of me (Sole controller, yes, I)
A link in your chain just won't do (Just won't do)
I don't want nothin' (I got nothin') to do with you
Oh-oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Well, people believe this sayin' is true (Ooh, sayin' is true)
Whatever will be, will forever do (And that's the price I say to pay)
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full (Woah, yeah)
I ain't got nothin' (Yeah) to do with you
[Post-Chorus]
(I ain't got nothin' to do with you)
I don't want nothin' to do with you
(Nothin', oh)
I don't want nothin', nothin' to do with you

I don't want nothin' (No, girl) to do with you (Nothin' to do with you)
I don't want nothin' (No, girl) to do with you (Oh)

With you, with you
