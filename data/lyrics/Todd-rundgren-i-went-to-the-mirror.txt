I went to the mirror this morning
I looked in the mirror instead
The first thing to come into focus
The first thing to come into focus
Was a face wrapped all around my head
There's something sticking out of the middle
I guess it's my nose, I suppose
I just don't recognize those eyes
All these years I've been watching from the other side
Uh oh, here I go thinking them crazy thoughts again
Who is that there?
You mean I been walking around in that all these years?
What's it all about?
Where's it all at?
I don't want to get heavy but uh, what am I doing here?
My lip has a dark spot upon it
My teeth look like plastic in chips
And there on my chin I discover
And there on my chin I discover
One lonely red and arrogant zit
I went about my business this morning
You got to get out of bed and make that bread
But try as I may to get away
I won't forget what I seen in the mirror today
I won't forget what I seen in the mirror today
I won't forget what I seen in the mirror today
I seen my eyes, I, I seen my nose
I seen my, my lips, my teeth
My, my gums, I seen my gums
I looked all the way down my throat
Listen I looked at my ears, I looked real hard at my ears
I looked at my hair, I think I'm going bald
I had hair all over the sink or something
