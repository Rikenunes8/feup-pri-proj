[Verse 1]
Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I wouldn't wanna stay here all night
The cars crawl past, all stuffed with eyes
Street lights share their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go
[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
[Verse 2]
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
[Verse 3]
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Learn to forget[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
