[Verse 1]
I've always come to the conclusion that "but" is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on one's head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside, I think you should know
[Chorus]
And baby, that's you, you, you
Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears
[Verse 2]
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, it's you, you, you
Made life's history (Oh, baby)
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
(Yeah, yeah)
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
Hey, you brought some joy inside my tears
Got to tell you
You, you, you made life's history (Hey)
You brought some joy inside my tears (You brought some joy inside my tears)
Baby, baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah, you made it, baby)
You, you, you made life's history (Made life's history)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You have done what no one thought could be (Nobody ever thought it would be)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You, you, you made life's history (Oh, oh)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You, you, you made life's history (Yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears (You, you)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Baby)
You brought some joy inside my
Tears
