Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

You better come on in my kitchen
Hey, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
[Verse 1]
Ah, the woman I love, took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky, stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen
Hey, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
[Verse 2]
Ah ah, she's gone, I know she won't come back
I've taken the last nickel out of her 
nation sack
You better come on in my kitchen
Hey, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
[Bridge]
(Oh, can't you hear that wind howl?)
Oh, can't you hear that wind howl?
You better come on in my kitchen
Hey, it's going to be rainin' outdoors
[Verse 3]
When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down
Looking for her good friend, none can be found
You better come on in my kitchen
Hey, it's going to be rainin' outdoors
[Verse 4]
Winter time's comin', it's gon' be slow
You can't make the winter, babe, that's 
dry long so
You better come on in my kitchen
'Cause it's going to be rainin' outdoors
