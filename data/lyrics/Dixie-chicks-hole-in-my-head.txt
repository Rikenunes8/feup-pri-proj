[Chorus 1]
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
Let's just say we will and then don't instead
[Chorus 2]
Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
You're going to take me boy on a wild goose chase
You're going to take me boy on a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place
[Verse 1]
You took my imagination and stomped it into ground
Now I can only think about you
Chasing the tracks that you left around
[Chorus 1]
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
You make me feel so bad that I wish I was dead
[Chorus 3]
Let the games begin
I'm never going to win
[Verse 2]
It must have knocked me crazy
It must have hit me hard
People must think I'm lazy
Like my shuffle's short
Of playing a card
[Chorus 2]
Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
I need a boy like you like a wild goose chase
I need a boy like you like a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place[Chorus 3]
Let the games begin
Yeah here I go again
[Outro]
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you
Like a hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
