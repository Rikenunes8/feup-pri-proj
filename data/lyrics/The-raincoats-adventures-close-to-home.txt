Passion that shouts
And red with anger
I lost myself
Through alleys of mysteries
I went up and down
Like a demented train
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Searching for something
That makes makes hearts move
I found myself
But my best possession
Walked in to the shade
And threaten to drift away
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Full of myself
I left you behind
As if I could, possessed by Quixote's dream
Went to fight dragons in the land of concrete
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hateDon't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
