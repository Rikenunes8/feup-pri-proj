[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
[Verse 1]
She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff and says "It's a crazy scene"
That red is green and she's a tangerine
[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high, I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down
[Verse 2]
She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
, she wasn't very nice
[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high, I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die
[Verse 3]
She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
And did you hear the news about the girl today?
She passed away
, what did her friend say?
[Outro]
They said she's too high, too high
Can't hang around anyway...
