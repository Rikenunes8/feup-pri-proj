[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there, so was I
In the park, Fourth of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen
[Pre-Chorus]
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on, so I am
[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gon' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relation-ships
[Pre-Chorus]
I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
[Bridge: Chilli (T-Boz)]
Oh why do I feel the way I do? (Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you?
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?
Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you
And I am diggin' the scene
[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
