The time is too short, But never too long
To reach ahead, to project the image
Which will in time become a concrete dream
Another cigarette, another day
From A to B, again avoiding C, D, and E
'Cause E's where you play the blues
Avoiding a death is to win the game
To avoid delegation, the big E
Drowning in the big swim, rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown
That's the lowdown
Drowning in the big swim, rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown
