[Intro]
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
[Verse]
We sat on the wall of happiness
We sat on the wall of love
We sat on the wall of security so high above
With his arms all around me
It was like a fairy tale
Two people so in love
Tell me, how could it fail?
[Pre-Chorus]
Walls started shakin' her love right out
Happiness is given away, security is coming down
He fell, I fell, all there is left to tell
[Chorus]
Is all the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
[Pre-Chorus]
Walls started shakin', I heard love crying out
Happiness is given away, security is coming down
He fell, I fell, and all there is left to tell
[Chorus]
Is all the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together
