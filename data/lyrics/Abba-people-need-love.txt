[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
[Verse 1: Björn & Benny 
and
 
Agnetha & Frida
]
Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down wants some female sympathy
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love till eternity
[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
[Post-Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
La la la la, la la la la-la
La la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la
La la la la la la la-la la la
[Verse 2: Björn & Benny 
and
 
Agnetha & Frida
]
Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon then he'll take it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares, isn't that what you call a friend?
Gotta have love to carry on living
Isn't it easy to understand?
[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
[Post-Chorus: Björn, Benny, 
Agnetha & Frida
]

People need hope, people need loving
(People need loving, yeah)
People need trust from a fellow man
(People need love)
People need love to make a good living
(People need loving, yeah)
People need faith in a helping hand
[Post-Chorus: Björn, Benny,
