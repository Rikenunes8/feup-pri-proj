A lot's been changin' lately and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's everybody else
But I'm done wastin' my time on the woe is me bull****
That's keepin' me from being myself
So look around and tell me what you want me to see
Maybe you're the person that you always wanted to be
Why you wanna be a sad boy, waste your time?
Lookin' for something that was right here all along

I think we're gettin' it wrong
It's too bad
When did it get cool to be so sad?
We're spinnin' backwards, did we all go mad?
Yeah, we're only human but wе've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smеll the **** roses

I said that I would never get what I want (Nope)
But I was only lookin' for a reason to flaunt
Think I'm over tryna break down everything that comes out
Maybe it's impossible to know what it means
What's it like to be a loser, happiness abuser?
Smilin' at the thought of never livin' it down
Does it matter if it's uphill, downhill?
I'm lettin' it go, I'm lettin' it out

It's too bad
When did it get cool to be so sad?
We're spinnin' backwards, did we all go mad?
Yeah, we're only human but we've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smell the **** roses
