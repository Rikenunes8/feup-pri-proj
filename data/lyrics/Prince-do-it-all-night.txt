[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I want to talk to you
I may be kind of shy
But I just got to tell you
What I'm going through
Someone over there says
He wants to get to know you
I don't care because
I really want to hold you
And I'm so scared
[Girl], he might do something
To you that you like
Now I've been waiting
Such a bloody long time
Just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I want to do
[Chorus]
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
[Verse 2]
Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy
When it comes to loving you
Can't you understand that I want
To hug and kiss you
I'll do anything I can just
To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, come on baby
Can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I want to mention
[Chorus]
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
