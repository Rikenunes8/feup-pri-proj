Almost heaven, West Jamaica
True ridge mountains
Shining Minko River
All my friends there
Older than those ridge
Younger than the mountains
Blowin' like a breeze
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads
I heard her voice
In the mornin' hour she calls me
Said son you remind me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road I feel a sickness, I sure did
Oh yesterday, yesterday
All my memories, oh, gathered 'round her
My old lady stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Tears gone from my eyes
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my my momma
Won't you take me go home country roads
