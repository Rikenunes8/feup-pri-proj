[Verse 1]
You may be sweet and nice
But that won't keep you warm at night
'Cause I'm the one who showed you how
To do the things you're doing now
[Verse 2]
He may feel all your charms
He may hold you in his arms
But I'm the one who let you in
I was right beside you then
[Bridge]
Once upon a time
You let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew, nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried?
[Verse 3]
I'm your toy
, I'm your old boy
But I don't want no one but you to love me
No, I wouldn't lie
You know I'm not that kind of guy
