[Intro]
"
Attention, attention.
..
Trente-neuf, quarante"
[Verse 1]
Imagine a war which everyone won
Permanent holiday in endless sun
Peace without wisdom, one steals to achieve
Relentlessly pretending to believe
Attitudes are materialistic
Positive or frankly realistic
Which is terribly old-fashioned, isn't it?
Or isn't it?
[Chorus]
(DJ culture)
Dance with me
(DJ culture)
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
Waiting for the night to end
(DJ, D...)
[Verse 2]
Let's pretend we won a war
Like a football match, ten-nil the score
Anything's possible, we're on the same side
Or otherwise on trial for our lives
I've been around the world for a number of reasons
I've seen it all, the change of seasons
And I, my lord, may I say nothing?
[Chorus]
(DJ culture)
Dance with me
(DJ culture)
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
Waiting for the night to end
(DJ culture)[Chorus]
(DJ culture)
Dance with me
(DJ culture)
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
Wondering who's your friend
(DJ culture)
[Bridge]
Now, as a matter of pride
Indulge yourself, your every mood
No feast days or fast days or days of abstinence intrude
[Verse 3]
Consider for a minute
Who you are, what you'd like to change
Never mind the scars
Bury the past, empty the shelf
Decide it's time to reinvent yourself
Like Liz before Betty, she after Sean
Suddenly you're missing, then you're reborn
And I, my lord, may I say nothing?
[Chorus]
(DJ culture)
"Une fois!"
(DJ culture)
"Deux fois!"
Living in a satellite fantasy
Waiting for the night to end
(DJ culture)[Chorus]
(DJ culture)
Dance with me
(DJ culture)
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
Wondering who's your friend
(DJ culture)
[Outro]
(DJ culture, DJ culture)
And I, my lord, may I say nothing?
Living in a satellite fantasy
Waiting for the night to end
(DJ culture)
