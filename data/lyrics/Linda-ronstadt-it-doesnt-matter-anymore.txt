[Verse 1]
There you go, baby, here am I
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
Golly gee, what have you done to me?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore
[Verse 2]
Do you remember, baby, last September
How you held me tight each and every night?
Oh, baby, how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore
[Chorus]
There's no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you
[Post-Chorus]
Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new, and baby, we'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
There's no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you
[Post-Chorus]
Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, 'til the end of time
And I'll find somebody new, baby, we'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore (You won't matter anymore)[Outro]
No, you won't matter anymore (You won't matter anymore)
You won't matter anymore
