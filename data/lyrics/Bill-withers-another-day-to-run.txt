If you don't look into your mind and find out what you're running from
Tomorrow might be just another day to run
If you just sit and waste your time
You'll be going where you're coming from (think about that)
Tomorrow might be just another day to run
Someone must control your mind
You're the one
Dark confusion's what you find when you run
I don't want to waste your time but I'm talking to you like a son
Tomorrow might be just another day to run
Walking down the road of life looking for direction
Sometimes my mind gets so mixed up I can't tell lust from affection
Gonna stop in to a roadside church and get my mind a rest
And Lord Jesus, help me get my soul together in the process
Pretty ladies stand in line waiting for inspection
Ragged old men drinking wine trying to drown rejection
I've been wasting too much time, I'm going to lose my mind unless, Lord Jesus
You help me get my soul together in the process
Oh now, Tony Jr. filled up his arm with dope
And he dreams about a valley
But the poor boy lives in an alley
Filled with papers that's thrown away
Lord, Lord, Lord, oh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Tell me Tony, tell me Tony, tell me Tony, tell me Tony
Tell me why, he wanna get high enough to die
Well, he's long on dreams and short on hope
Sometimes he goes to rallies, stops by to see young Sally
Lord, just to pass the time away
Lord, Lord, oh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Tell me Tony, tell me Tony, tell me Tony
Tell me why, he wanna get high enough to die
