Your gentle body lying here so close to me
As you move your hand slowly across my face
Your touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
What a love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, oh such beauty
Like the love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, oh such beauty
What a love in the way I see you
