[Verse 1]
There's something in the way she moves
Or looks my way or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
And if I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind
[Chorus]
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now almost all the time
And if I'm well, you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now
Quite a long, long time and I feel fine
[Verse 2]
Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
And to silently remind me
Of the happiness and good times that I know
[Verse 3]
Just got to know them, it isn't what she's got to say
Or how she thinks and where she's been
To me the words are nice the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
She says them mostly just to calm me down
[Chorus]
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now almost all the time
And if I'm well, you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now
Quite a long, long time and I feel fine
