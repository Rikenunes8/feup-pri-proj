[Verse 1]
I heard church bells ringing
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger, he placed a ring
Ohh-oh
[Verse 2]
I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise
"Till death do us part"
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
[Chorus]
All I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
[Verse 2]
And now the wedding is over
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them, life has just begun
But mine is ending
[Chorus]
Ohh
All I could do, all I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry
(Cry, cry, cry)
