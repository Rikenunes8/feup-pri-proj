That uninterested face of yours, the bored tip of your toes
Please, look at me now
Put your phone down, don't even think of turning your head away
Let me know your type
You can pick and choose me, yeah

Oh, I cover your eyes with my hands
Oh, get closer to the secret
I'll take you to a whole new world
Yeah, open your eyes now, go
Mix the colors in the palette, pick your filter
Which me do you want?
The one to change your world, I'm your filter
Overlay me in your heart

(Okay) Can you feel it now? Is it still not enough?
(Yes) Girl, you have your chance
I can be your Genie
How ‘bout Aladdin?
I'll be anything
You can pick and choose me, yeah

Oh, I will embrace you like in your dreams
Oh, it's a secret spec
For you, every day I'll be new
It's not fun to stay the same all the time

Mix the colors in the palette, pick your filter
Which me do you want?
To change your world, I'm your filter
Overlay me in your heart
Look at me who has suddenly turned into a child
The more you look, the cuter I am, like crazy
Overcoming different tastes and standards
You'll be wanting only me
Yeah, because you are the one who made me

I'm a brand new filter that you've never seen before
Entrust yourself to me
To see more thrilling things, pick your filter
Contain only me

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Pick your filter, contain only me
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I’m your filter, entrust yourself to me

We'll become a new us
Ayy, overlay me in your heart
