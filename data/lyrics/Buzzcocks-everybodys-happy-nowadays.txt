[Verse 1]
I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion, 
love is a dream
But I don't know what it is
[Hook]
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
[Verse 2]
I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion, love is a dream
But I don't know what it is
[Hook]
'cause everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
[Verse 3]
Life's an illusion, love is the dream
But I don't know what it is
Everyone's sayin' things to me
But I know it's okay, okay[Hook]
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
[Bridge]
Life's an illusion, love is a dream
Life's an illusion, love is the dream
Life's the illusion, love is a dream
Life's the illusion, love is the dream
[Hook]
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays, days, oh
[Verse 4]
Well, bet you're tired of being upset
Always wanting something you never could get
Life's no illusion, love's not a dream
Now I know just what it is
[Hook]
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
