I'm drifting
I'm drifting
Like a ship out on the sea
I'm drifting
I'm drifting
I'm drifting
Like a ship out on the sea
No, I ain't got nobody
In the world to care for me
If my baby would only take me back again, back again
If my baby would only take me back again, back again
I know I'm a good for nothing
And I haven't got no friends
Listen to me, honey
I gave you all my money
Tell me tell me tell me tell me
What more can I do
Didn't I give to u all my money?
Now tell me what more can I do!
I'll realize you're a good little girl
But it seems that you won't be true
Seems like I got to tell you
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Listen to me
I know you gonna miss me
This time you gonna be
The one to cry
