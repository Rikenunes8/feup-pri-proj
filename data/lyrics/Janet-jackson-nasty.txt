[Intro]
Gimme a beat
[Verse 1]
Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, ha
Better be a gentleman or you'll turn me off
That's right, let me tell it
[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys don't mean a thing (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys don't ever change (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
[Verse 2]
I don't like no nasty car, I don't like nasty food
Ooh, ooh yeah
The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove (Ha)
Will this one do? Uh-huh, I know, sing
[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys don't mean a thing (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys don't ever change (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, give me a nasty groove (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, let me see your nasty body move (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
[Post-Chorus]
I could learn to like this
Listen up
[Bridge]
I'm not a prude (No)
I just want some respect (That's right)
So close the door if you want me to respond (Ooh, ooh yeah)
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is control
No, my first name ain't baby
It's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys don't ever change (Huh)
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me (Uh)
Nasty, don't mean a thing (Uh)
Oh, you nasty boys (Uh)
[Post-Chorus]
I love this part
[Breakdown]
Hey, who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts? (Nasty boys)
Who's that in that nasty car? (Nasty boys)
Who's that eatin' that nasty food? (Nasty boys)
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove? (Nasty boys)
Ladies?
[Outro]
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
