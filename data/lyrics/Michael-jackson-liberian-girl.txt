Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl
You came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true
[Chorus]
Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"
[Post-Chorus]

Your love's so complete
Liberian girl
You kiss me then, ooh, the world
You do this to me

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
I wait for the day
When you have to say, "I do"
And I'll smile and say it, too
And forever will be true[Outro]
