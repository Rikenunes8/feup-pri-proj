[Verse 1]
Excuse me, but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
Yeah, I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say, you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that
[Chorus]
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these years
[Verse 2]
So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?
[Chorus]
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these
[Bridge]
Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy[Verse 3]
Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, 
here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them
[Chorus]
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years
[Outro]
I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years
