I was having this discussion
In a taxi heading downtown
Rearranging my position
On this friend of mine who had a little bit of a breakdown
I said, "Hey, you know, breakdowns come and breakdowns go, so
What are you going to do about it? That's what I'd like to know"
[Chorus]
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
It was in the early morning hours
When I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers
I slammed into a brick wall
I said, "Hey, is this my problem? Is this my fault?
If that's the way it's going to be I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt"
[Chorus 2x]
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
I was walking down the street
When I thought I heard this voice say
"Say, ain't we walking down the same street together
On the very same day?"
I said, "Hey, senorita, that's astute" I said
"Why don't we get together and call ourselves an institute?"
[Chorus 2x]
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
