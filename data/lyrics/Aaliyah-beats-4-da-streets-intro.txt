[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Aaliyah, Aaliyah, wake up
You just now entered into the next level (Yes)
The new world of funk, as we do it one time
Creepin' through the fog, who that y'all?
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
Creepin' through the fog, who that y'all?
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
[Verse 1: Aaliyah & 
Missy Elliott
]
I got the beats for the streets (
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
)
Everything I make is so unique, hey (
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
)
Say, "Hey," if you down with me (
Hey, A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
)
If you step to me, there's no need (
A-A-L-I-Y-A-H
)
[Outro: Missy Elliott]
Creepin' through the fog, who that y'all?
Damn, she be the bomb (Say what?), dang
Creepin' through the fog, who that y'all?
Dang, damn, she be the bomb
Wake up, goodnight
