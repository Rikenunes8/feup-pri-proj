[Verse 1]
Well, Iâ€™ve already had two beers I'm ready for the broom
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
I'm a good ole' boy but I've been sniffing' too many eggs
Talking to too many people, drinking too many kegs
[Chorus]
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
And I ain't got a dime
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm groaning' in a hallway pretty soon I'll be mad
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake
[Chorus]
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
And I ain't got a dime
[Verse 3]
Now, don't crowd me, lady or I'll fill up your shoe
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue
I'm a thousand years old and I'm a generous bomb
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm
[Chorus]
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
And I ain't got a dime
[Verse 4]
Now, I'm starting' to drain, my stool's gonna squeak
If I walk too much farther my crane's gonna leak
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?[Chorus]
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
And I ain't got a dime
