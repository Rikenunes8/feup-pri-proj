[Intro]
I can remember when
We had, we had it all (Reminisce on the love we had)
You and I, you and I (Reminisce on the love we had)
Yeah
Ooh, you know we had it all
You and I (Reminisce on the love we had)
Yeah
[Chorus]
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
[Verse 1]
I know that we've been here before
The candlelight and you, walking softly through my door
Come on in my sweet, how have you been?
You're so nice, but tonight, we're gonna be more than just friends
[Pre-Chorus]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane with the love we shared
[Chorus]
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
(Reminisce, reminisce, reminisce)
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had[Verse 2]
I can see you standing there alone, like an angel
Tryin' to find his way home
I don't remember, how we fell apart
Here we are again, come on, ride into my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane with the love we shared
[Chorus]
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
(Reminisce, reminisce)
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
[Bridge]
Make the time tonight
The feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Make the time tonight
The feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Make the time tonight
The feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had

Oh boy, ooh reminisce, reminisce on the love we had
