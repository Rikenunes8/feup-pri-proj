[Intro: D.M.C. & 
Run
]
Everyone out there ready?
It goes a-one, two, three, and
[Verse 1: D.M.C. & 
Run
]
Perfection to D
 
is quite essential
He has to live up to his potential
I work real hard all day and night
I get to it and do it 'cause I want it right
I got bass, 
tone
, I use 
cologne
And then I rock 
the funky
 rhyme 
on
 the 
microphone
I got a funky fresh 
car
 with the funky fresh 
bar
I'm a funky fresh 
star
 and I'm up to 
par
My name is D.M.
C.
 down with Run and 
Jay
Is everything copacetic, y'all? 
Kind of a-okay
[Chorus]
Perfection (Yo, yo, yo, what we talkin 'bout, what we talkin 'bout?)
Perfection (Most definitely)
[Verse 2: D.M.C. & 
Run
]
I got prescription glasses and my eyes are correct
Two times every year I go to have them checked
Perfection's my selection, and I will select
And if it's not (Perfect) I will perfect[Chorus]
Perfection (What we got?)
Perfection (Who me? Iâ€” talkin' 'bout me?)
[Verse 3: Run & 
D.M.C.
]
I got a credit 
card
 made out of 
gold
I get 
cash
 in a 
flash
 and the story's told
I got D.M.
C.
, I got JM
J
I got Jeff, 
he's def
, and Runny-Ray
I got a dog, 
a cat
, a mouse, 
a rat
A fly, 
he won't die
, and a little gnat
My name is DJ 
Run
 and he's 
Darryl 
Mack
Run-
D.M.C.
, 
right and exact
[Chorus]
Perfection
Perfection (C'mon, let's get 'em, tell 'em, D)
[Verse 4: D.M.C. & 
Run
]
I won't fail, I won't flop
Stall or stutter, yes, I won't stop
It takes hard work to be like this
You should know
 'cause I'm a perfectionist
[Chorus]
Perfection
Perfection
Perfection (Yo, DJ Run, what is it?)
Perfection (Perfectly speaking)
Perfection
Perfection (P-P-P-P)
Perfection (P-P-P-Perfect)
Perfection (Perfectly speaking)
Perfection (P-P-P-P, 100 percent)
Perfection (Roll, roll, roll, c'mon, c'mon c'mon)
Perfection (Word, there it is)
