[Chorus]
You've got her in your pocket
And there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home
[Verse 1]
Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do?
Well you know
[Chorus]
You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home
[Verse 2]
The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
And she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want
[Chorus]
To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home
[Verse 3]
And in your own mind, you know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her
But now you're scared, you think she's running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say;
"Don't go away"
'Cause I want[Chorus]
To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home
[Outro]
Home sweet home
