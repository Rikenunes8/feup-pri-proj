Walking down the road with your pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad (Woah woah woii!)
Walking down the road with your ratchet in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad (Woah woah woii!)

You're just robbing and you're stabbing
And you're looting and you're shooting
Boy, you're too bad (Too bad)
You're just robbing and you're stabbing
And you're looting and you're shooting
Boy, you're too bad (Too bad)
One of these days when you hear a voice say "come"
Where you gonna run to? (Woah woah woii!)
One of these days when you hear a voice say "come"
Where you gonna run to? (Woah woah woii!)

You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock (No rock)
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock (Nowhere)
