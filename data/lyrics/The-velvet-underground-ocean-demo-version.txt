Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the shore
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea
Earth is a hollow hair, bought of a bigger head
It nearly drives me crazy
I am a lazy son
I never get things done
[Incomprehensible]
But here comes the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea, down by the sea
Down by the sea
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the shore
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea
[Incomprehensible] for evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
It nearly drives me crazy
I am a lazy son
I never get things done
[Incomprehensible]
But here comes the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
