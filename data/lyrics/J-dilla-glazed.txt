Childhood in my life wasn’t very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
People moving out, people moving in
The only one talking about love is the preacher
Where only the strong survive
It’s a dog eat dog world
Wake up world, wake up world, wake up world, wake up world
Give peace a chance
Are you afraid?
Time is running out
Give peace a chance
Are you afraid?
Time is running out
Sure it's strange
Sure it's strange
