Relax and settle down
Let your mind go 'round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band
Hold my hand

Relax, don't wonder why
We'll float up in the sky
We'll love right where we lie
You like a horse, I'll ride
O'er the land
Through the sand
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems

Relax and settle down
Let your mind go 'round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band
Hold my hand

Relax, don't wonder why
Wе'll float up in the sky
We'll love right whеre we lie
You like a horse, I'll ride
O'er the land
Through the sand

Relax
Relax
Relax
