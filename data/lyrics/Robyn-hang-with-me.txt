[Verse 1]
Will you tell me once again
How we're gonna be just friends?
If you're for real and not pretend?
Then I guess you can hang with me
When my patience's wearing thin
When I'm ready to give in
Will you pick me up again?
Then I guess you can hang with me
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you do me right, I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight, I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind, there will be time for that too
If you hang with me
[Chorus]
Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me
'Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree
Oh-whoa, you can hang with me
[Verse 2]
When you see me drift astray
Out of touch and out of place
Will you tell me to my face?
Then I guess you can hang with me
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you do me right, I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight, I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind, there will be time for that too
If you hang with me
[Chorus]
Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me
'Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree
Oh-whoa, you can hang with me[Verse 3]
Will you tell me once again
How we're gonna be just friends?
If you're for real and not pretend?
Then I guess you can hang with me
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you do me right, I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight, I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind, there will be time for that too
If you hang with me
[Chorus]
Just don't (Don't) fall (Fall) recklessly, headlessly in love with me
'Cause it's gonna be (It's gonna be)
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity (Baby)
If we agree (You can hang with me)
Don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me
'Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree (We can do whatever)
Ooh-whoa (If you hang with me)
Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me
'Cause it's gonna be (It's gonna be)
All heartbreak (All heartbreak), blissfully painful and insanity (Oh, yeah)
If we agree (Yeah)
Oh-whoa, you can hang with me
