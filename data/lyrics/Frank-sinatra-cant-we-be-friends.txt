[Intro]
I took each word she said as gospel truth
The way a silly little child would
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood
She didn't mean it, I should have seen it
But now it's too late
[Verse 1]
I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams
Now it seems this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"
[Verse 2]
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long I can see the way this ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"
[Bridge]
Why should I care though she gave me the air?
Why should I cry, heave a sigh and wonder why?
And wonder why
[Verse 3]
I thought I'd found the gal I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be just friends?"
