[Intro]
(One, two)
[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue-twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey, not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams
[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself
[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, 
we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed
, 
we're The Spiders From Mars
[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself
[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on
[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself
[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
