[Verse 1]
A letter came today from the draft board
With trembling hands I read the questionnaire
It asked me questions about my mama and papa
Now that ain't what I call exactly fair
[Chorus]
So I'm heading for the nearest foreign border
Vancouver might be just my kind of town
Cause they don't need the kind of law and order
That tends to keep a good man underground
[Verse 2]
A sad old soldier once told me a story
About a battlefield that he was on
He said a man should never fight for glory
He must know what is right and what is wrong
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Now, I don't know how much I owe my uncle
But I suspect it's more than I can pay
He's asking me to sign a three-year contract
I guess I'll catch the first bus out today
[Chorus]
