[Verse]
Do you know how it feels to be lonesome?
When there's just no one left who really cares
Did you ever try to smile at some people?
And all they ever seem to do is stare
[Bridge]
And you remember how it feels to be cold again
When the happiness of love has gone away
And you never want to go out on the street again
And you only seem to live from day to day
[Verse]
Do you know how it feels to be lonesome?
When there's just no one left who really cares
Did you ever try to smile at some people?
Yes and all they ever seem to do is stare
Yes and all they ever seem to do is stare
