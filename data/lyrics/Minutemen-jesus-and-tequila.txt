[Verse 1]
I had a girl
She loved what she saw
She loved me so good
She made her daddy mad
But my woman cried
She's dead to me now
My woman ran off
And I can't deny it
[Chorus]
My life
Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
Can't deny it
[Verse 2]
I had a job
It paid me good
I could have my fun
And tip the preacher too
My boss yelled
He's dead to me now
My boss kicked me out
And I can't deny it[Chorus]
My life
Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
You better listen to me
'Cause I'm gonna tell you, son
Don't give away your love
And don't give away your sweat
Because a girl can't know you
And a boss can't afford you
[Chorus]
Remember
Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
Remember
Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
