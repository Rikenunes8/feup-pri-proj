One, two, three, four!

Well, she was just seventeen, and you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Oh)
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woah)
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went “boom” when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woah)
Since I saw her standing there

Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
