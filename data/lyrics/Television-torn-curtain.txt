[Verse 1]
Torn curtain reveals another play
Torn curtain, such an exposÃ©
!
I'm uncertain when beauty meets abuse
Torn curtain loves all ridicule
[Chorus]
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Flowing by like tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before
[Verse 2]
Torn curtain giving me the glance
Torn curtain is bringing on the trance
But I'm not hurting, holding to the thread
Torn curtain lifts me on the tread
[Chorus]
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling by like years
(Years, years) The tears I never shed
[Verse 3]
Torn curtain, feels more like a rake
Torn curtain, how much does it take?
Burn it down
[Chorus]
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before
[Outro]
(Tears, tears)
(Years, years)
(Tears, tears)
(Years, years)
