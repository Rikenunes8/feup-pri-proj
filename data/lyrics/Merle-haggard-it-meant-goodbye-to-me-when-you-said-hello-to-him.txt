[Verse]
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
I made a big mistake when I introduced her to my friend
And gave him a chance to dance with her
As I watched them in the crowd, I could hear my heart beat loud
'Cause it meant goodbye to me when she said hello to him
[Verse]
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
She just held on to his hand when it was break time for the band
And it was plain to see that I'd lost out
So I slipped away to cry, felt so low I could die
'Cause it meant goodbye to me when she said hello to him
[Verse]
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Is there anywhere to go where a broken heart won't show?
Everyone must know what's wrong with me
They can tell about my ways, I go round lost in a daze
'Cause it meant goodbye to me when she said hello to him
[Outro]
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
