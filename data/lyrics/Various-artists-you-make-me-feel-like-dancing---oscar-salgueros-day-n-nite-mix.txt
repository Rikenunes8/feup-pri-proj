You've got a cute way of talkin'
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walkin'
Like a dog hangin' on your lead
I'm in a spin, you know
Shakin' on string, you know
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancin'
I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away
I feel like dancin', dancin', ah
Quarter to four in the mornin'
I ain't feeling tired no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home
You put a spell on me
I'm right where you want me to be
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancin'
I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away (yeah)
I feel like dancin' (woo), dancin'
You take me higher
Allowed to catch your fire claws
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I feel like dancin'
Dancin' (woo), dance the night away (yeah)
I feel like dancing (woo)
Dancin' (woo), dance the night away
I feel like dancing (woo)
Dancin' (woo), dance the night away (yeah)
I feel like dancin' (woo), dancin' (woo)
You really slip me a portion
I can't get of the floor
All this perfect your emotion
You got to give me some more
You got to give me some more
And if you let me stay
There's a lot to wait
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make feel like dancin'
II wanna dance my life away
You make feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away (I feel)
