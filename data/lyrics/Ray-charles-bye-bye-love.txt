[Intro]
Yep
[Chorus]
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna die
[Verse 1]
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure look happy and I'm so blue
She was my baby 'til he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Oh, woah, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Bye-bye love
 (Well)
Bye-bye happiness
 (What you say?)
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And that's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me
Woah
[Chorus]
Bye-bye love
 (Mhm)
Bye-bye sweet caress
 (Mhm)
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna die[Outro]
Yeah (
I think I'm gonna die
)
Well (
I think I'm gonna die
)
Well (
I think I'm gonna die
)
What you say? (
I think I'm gonna die
)
One more time (
I think I'm gonna die
)
Yeah (
I think I'm gonna die
)
Repeat that please (
I think I'm gonna die
)
