[Verse 1]
I'd like to be somebody else
And not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself
A house out of plasticine
[Chorus 1]
Ahh, shake along with me
Ahh, shake along with me
[Verse 2]
I've been driving in my car
With my friend Mister Soft
Mister Clean
 
and Mister Benn
Are living in my loft
[Chorus 1]
Ahh, shake along with me
Ahh, shake along with me
[Bridge]
I'm sorry but I just don't know
I know you said I told you so
When you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know that it's the right time
Then you'll know that it's the right time
[Chorus 2]
To shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
[Verse 3]
Mister Sifter sold me songs
When I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
But only when they're green
[Chorus 3]
Ahh, shake along with me
Ahh, shake along with me
Ahh, shake along with me[Outro]
Ahh, shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
