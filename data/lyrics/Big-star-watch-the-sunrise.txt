[Verse 1]
I can feel it, now it's time
Open your eyes
Fears be gone, it won't be long
There's a light in the sky
[Chorus]
It's okay to look outside
The day it will abide
And watch the sunrise
[Verse 2]
Sun, it shines on all of us
We are one in its hands
Come inside and light my room
Like the heart of every man
[Chorus]
It's okay to look outside
The day it will abide
And watch the sunrise
[Verse 1]
I can feel it, now it's time
Open your eyes
Fears be gone, it won't be long
There's a light in the sky
[Chorus]
It's okay to look outside
Your love it will abide
And watch the sunrise
