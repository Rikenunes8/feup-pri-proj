[Verse 1]
My baby loves me, I'm so happy
Happy makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a TV
TV brings me closer to the world
[Chorus]
My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day
[Verse 2]
My baby loves me, 
I'm so hungry
Hunger makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a donut
The hole's the size of this entire world
[Chorus]
My whole life
Looks like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Looked like a picture of a sunny day
[Verse 3]
My baby loves me, I'm so angry
Anger makes me a modern girl
Took my money, I couldn't buy nothin'
I'm sick of this brave new world
[Outro]
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
