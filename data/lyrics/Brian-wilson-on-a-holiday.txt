[Verse 1]
A pirate with a tune on a holiday
A lazy Mr. Moon on a getaway
And isn't that a mood for a milky way
A ukelele lady around a lei
[Hook]
Rock, rock, roll (Child!)
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
For a holiday
[Bridge]
Abash and forth a starboard course
With north abeam, sherry of course
The men will share some sport and now me hearty
Not the rum of Carib' scum
It's port tonight, drink up and come
Un-weigh the anchor Yank and we will party!
[Verse 2]
A shanty town, a shanty in Waikiki
And juxtapose a man with a mystery
A blue Hawaiian captures his melody
Pauahi O Kalani
 is what he sings to me
[Hook]
Rock, rock, roll (Child!)
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
For a holiday
[Outro]
Long, long ago, long ago
Whisperin' wind sent my wind chimes a-tinklin'
Whisperin' wind sent my wind chimes a-tinklin'
Whisperin' wind sent my wind chimes a-tinklin'
