When the temperature is down to four below
How my knees get to knockin'
I need to find some heat, you know this cold really gets to me
Drives me out of my mind
But when the wind begins to blow
Like a duck that flies south for the winter
I'm a warm blooded girl who likes to feel
The sunshine against my skin
But on a warm summer day you can hear the children play
We were doing things just for the sake of having fun
Sometimes I get a craving to do a little sun bathing'
But when spring is here I know it won't be long
Till the time comes that I waited for all year, I like it
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like, that's what I like
People having fun
Groovin' in the sun
Red-breasted robins sing a song while the bees are makin' honey
Kids who need love, never fell in love, fall in love for the very first time
And on a day that's good and warm I want the keys to the Maserati
I just ride around actin' a clown, swingin' with the top down
Rock bodies really hoppin', kids are really rockin'
And people gettin' down with the rhythm of the day
But when it's really hot the beach is my spot
Or coolin' out with the fire hydrant on
All the games that we play, that's what I really enjoy
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', smooth summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like, that's what I like
People having fun
Groovin' in the sunSummertime lovin', summertime livin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like
Summertime livin', summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
That's what I like, that's what I like
Summertime livin', sweet summertime lovin'
