[Verse 1]
If you lose your money
Great God, don't lose your mind
If you lose your money
Great God, don't lose your mind
And if you lose your woman
Please don't fool with mine
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog
Watch my lady whilst I sleep
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog
Watch my lady whilst I sleep
'Cause women these days
They're so doggone crooked
That they might make off 'fore day creep
[Chorus]
Well, you can't watch your wife
And your outside woman too
You know you can't watch your wife
And your outside women's too
'Cause when you're out with your woman
Your wife will be at home
Cooking your food, doing your dirt
Buddy, what're you trying to do?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You can't watch your wife
And your outside women's too
You know you can't watch your wife
And your outside women, too
When you're out with your woman
Your wife will be at home
Doing your dirt, cooking your food
Buddy, what're you trying to do?
