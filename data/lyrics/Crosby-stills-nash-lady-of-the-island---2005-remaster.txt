Holding you close undisturbed before a fire
The pressure in my chest when you breathe in my ear
We both knew this would happen when you first appeared
My lady of the island

The brownness of your body in the fire glow
Except the places where the sun refused to go
Our bodies were a perfect fit, in afterglow we lay
My lady of the island
Letting myself wander through the world inside your eyes
You know I'd like to stay here until every tear runs dry
My lady of the island

Wrapped around each other in the peepin' sun
Beams of sunshine light the stage, the red light's on
I never want to finish what I've just begun with you
My lady of the island
