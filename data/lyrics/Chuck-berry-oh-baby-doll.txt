[Chorus]
Oh, Baby Doll
When bells ring out the summer free
Oh, baby doll
Will it end for you and me
We'll sing our old Alma Mater
And think of things that used to be
[Verse 1]
I remember it so well
Back when the weather was cool
We used to have so much fun
When we were walking to school
If we stopped off to hear
The latest songs they sing
And we just make it in
Before the bells would ring
[Chorus]
Oh, Baby Doll
When bells ring out the summer free
Oh, baby doll
Will it end for you and me
We'll sing our old Alma Mater
And think of things that used to be
[Verse 2]
When the teacher was gone
That's when we'd have a ball
We use to dance and play
All up and down the hall
We had a portable radio
We was balling the jack
We'd be all back in order
When the teacher got back
[Chorus]
Oh, Baby Doll
When bells ring out the summer free
Oh, baby doll
Will it end for you and me
We'll sing our old Alma Mater
And think of things that used to be
