[Verse 1]
I've gotta broken heart again
Because my only supposed-to-be friend
You see, he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
[Verse 2]
I've gotta broken heart again
Because I ain't got no money to spend
You see, I spent it all on a long distance phone call
Begging her to please come home, yeah, yeah
[Ad lib]
Ah, yeah
[Verse 3]
It doesn't matter what I do
I can't stop, ah, thinking bout you
The little things you said
The things you do to me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you out to my head
Oh, oh, gotta broken heart again, yeah
This time it's serious
It feels just like the end
Because once your love has gone away
There ain't nothing, nothing left to say
