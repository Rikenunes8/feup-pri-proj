Child, don't you know
I don't want to let you go
Child, don't you know
That I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you
Styles come and go
But I'm not going to let you go
Styles, they come and go
But I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you
