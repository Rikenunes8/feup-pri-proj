You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
So you traveled on a steamer to the violence of the sun
And the colors of the sea blind your eye with trembling
Mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave
Ulysses:
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly
Singing
And the sparkling waves are calling you to touch the
White-lace lips
And you see your girl's brown body dancing through the
Turquoise
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the
Sea
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind
The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the
Winter
Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the
Distant sands
With the tales of brave Ulysses: how his naked ears were
Tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the
Winter
