Congratulations
Seems like you've done It again
And I ain't had such misery
Since I don't know when
I notice so many people
Slipping away
And many more waiting in the lines
In the courtrooms today
In the courtrooms today
Love is not a game
Love Is not a toy
Love's no romance
Love will do you in
And love will wash you out
And needless to say
You won't stand a chance, you won't stand a chance
I'm hungry for learning
Won't you answer me please
Can a man a woman
Live together in peace
Oh, live together in peace
