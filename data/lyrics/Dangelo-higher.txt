Feels like Heaven, yeah, when I think about you
Sparkin' that love, oh yeah, within my soul, oh
And when I touch you, yeah, I can't describe it
Sending chills, yeah, yeah, down to my bones, ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
God as my witness (Hey) and watching over (And watching over)
We'll write our love (We'll write our love, yeah)
Write our love (We'll write our love, yeah) in the stone
Please give us strength, Lord, to fight our battles
And we can walk on, yeah, the streets of gold
Hey
[Chorus]
'Cause you take me higher (Oh, yeah) than I've ever, ever known (Yeah)
Give me good feeling (Ah, oh, yeah), like a king and queen on a throne (Like a king and queen on a throne)
'Cause you take me higher (Yeah, yeah), further than the stars above (Oh-oh)
Send me in ecstasy, baby (Yeah), with your love (With your love, oh-oh)[Verse 2]
Tell me what you're thinking of (Tell me what you're thinking of)
Must be thinking 'bout love, yeah (Must be thinking 'bout love)
Put your hands into mine, love
And then we'll take off to the skies above (Ooh-ooh)
Soft like an angel (Oh, yes), ooh
Like the feathers laying on a dove
Touch me with your soul, love, 'til I lose control
Ooh
[Bridge]
Just like an angel (Yeah) watching over me
(You protect me from my fears)
I once was blind (Yeah), but now I see
(Ever since the day you appeared)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life
'Til the day I die, baby (Yeah, yeah)
(I just wanna tell you that I love you)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life (Yeah)
'Til the day I die, baby (Yeah, yeah)
(I just wanna show you how I want you in my life)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life (Oh-oh)
