[Verse 1]
Sittin' in the kitchen, a 
house in Macon
Loretta's
 singing on the radio
Smell of coffee, eggs, and bacon
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Verse 2]
Pull the curtains back and look outside
Somebody somewhere don't know
Come on now, child, we're gonna go for a ride
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Chorus]
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Verse 3]
Can't find a damn thing in this place
Nothing's where I left it before
Set of keys and a dusty suitcase
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Verse 4]
There goes the screen door slamming shut
You better do what you're told
When I get back this room better be picked-up
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Chorus]
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Verse 5]
Low hum of voices in the front seat
Stories nobody knows
Got folks in Jackson we're going to meet
Car wheels on a gravel road[Verse 6]
Cotton fields stretching miles and miles
Hank's
 voice on the radio
The telephone poles, trees, and wires fly on by
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Chorus]
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Verse 7]
Broken down shacks, engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin' in the yard
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Verse 8]
Child in the backseat about four or five years
Lookin' out the window
Little bit of dirt mixed with tears
Car wheels on a gravel road
[Chorus]
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
