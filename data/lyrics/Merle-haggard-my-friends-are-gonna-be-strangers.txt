[Verse 1]
Oh, the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone
[Chorus]
From now on, all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone
[Verse 2]
It amazes me not knowing any better
Than to think I had a love that would be true
Why, I should be taken out and tarred and feathered
To have let myself be taken in by you
[Chorus]
From now on, all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone
