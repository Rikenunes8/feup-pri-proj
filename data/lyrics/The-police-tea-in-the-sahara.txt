[Verse 1]
My sisters and I
Have one wish before we die
And it may sound strange
As if our minds are deranged
Please don't ask us why
Beneath the sheltering sky
We have this strange obsession
You have the means in your possession
[Chorus]
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
[Verse 2]
The young man agreed
He would satisfy their need
So they danced for his pleasure
With a joy you could not measure
They wait for him here
The same place every year
Beneath the sheltering sky
Across the desert he would fly
[Chorus]
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
[Verse 3]
The sky turned to black
Would he ever come back?
They would climb a high dune
They would pray to the moon
But he'd never return
So the sisters would burn
As their eyes searched the land
With their cups still full of sand[Chorus]
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
[Outro]
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
