[Verse 1]
She takes the sweet outside
She takes the sweet outside
The sooner I fight, the sooner I mind, the sooner I mind
A cradle to the tears
The sooner I fight, the sooner I mind, the sooner I mind
She takes the sweet outside
To part our grand demise
[Pre-Chorus]
If they say it's not suicide
If they say it's not suicide
[Chorus]
Then I will bet on your life
From sodden vale and hell's divide
That wind says rain
As blossoms fell for live TV
The ghosts we slay come ours to reap
Upending what's land's end
If they say it's not suicide, then what is
At the bottom of a boot black sea?
[Verse 2]
She cools at the flame
She cools at the flame
The sooner I mind, the sooner I fight, the sooner I fight
Chanting our device
The sooner I mind, the sooner I fight, the sooner I fight
[Chorus]
Where nothin' real settles in
As televised, a covenant
The bereft are blown cathodes
And the blame strafes every zone
In fever dreams, in blood shot odes
The skies never seemed so far
[Bridge]
If they say it's not suicide
If they say it's not suicide
If they say it's not suicide
To the full of gods at peace
If I'd leave here, you're first at least
You're why I fought
And I will bet on your life
From sodden vale and hell's divide
You're why I fought[Outro]
If they say it's not suicide
And what is?
