And she’s going to burn, if she stays there
The flames rise up to heaven to die
There’s no one else around there
There’s no one else, sitting and clapping
And she’s going to burn, if she stays there
The flames rise to heaven to die
There’s no one else around there
There’s no one else, there’s no one else

At night, the exit of Bagdad
Black hair, dark eyes
Beautiful but sad
Sitting, head down and clapping
Meanwhile around her
They passed, looked at her
They looked at her without seeing anything
Alone at hell
In hell she's trapped
Sitting, joining her hands
To the beat of bulerias
It seems like she was praying
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them

From the lights
Comes out an angel that fell down
He has a mark on his soul
But she did not see it
Sitting, to heaven you gotta pray
Fallen in love with her evils
That God will have to collect

And she’s going to burn, if she stays there
The flames rise up to heaven to die
There’s no one else around there
There’s no one else, sitting and clapping
And she’s going to burn, if she stays there
The flames rise to heaven to die
There’s no one else around there
There’s no one else, there’s no one else
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
(She joins the palms of her hands and separates them)
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
She joins the palms of her hands and separates them
