[Verse 1]
Ask me why
I say it's most unusual
How can I even try to explain
Why today I feel like dancing
Singing like lovers sing
[Refrain]
When I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
[Verse 2]
Ask me when (
Ta-ra-ra-ra
)
I say it started when I met you (
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ra
)
And ever since then I knew that the past couldn't last
For right now, I think I'm running
A race that I know I'm gonna win
[Refrain]
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
[Bridge]
If people say I'm crazy, I tell 'em that it's true
Let them watch with amazement
Say it won't last beyond breakfast
It's a phase he's going through
Denigrate or speculate on what I'm going through
Because it isn't the sort of thing I would normally do
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Ask me what (
Ta-ra-ra-ra
)
I say I think it's good for you (
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ra
)
Believe it or not, I know where it's all leading to
I feel like taking all my clothes off
Dancing to the Rite of Spring[Refrain]
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of
This kind of thing
