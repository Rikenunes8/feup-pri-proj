[Verse 1]
Lady, you know I heard the neighbors say
Baby, you might be leavin' me today
Oh yeah, (mmm), someone's come along and shared your time
Don't care, no I don't, no
But you can't be his and still be mine, so
[Chorus]
Ooh, got to choose, who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, oh sometimes
I know you need a change of pace
Oh yeah, but I ain't gonna run no race
Baby, you've got to tell me yes or no
Alright, alright, come on and tell me
Tell me if you're gonna go, come on!
[Chorus]
Ooh, got to choose, who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose, who's your baby
[Chorus]
Ooh, got to choose, who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose, got to choose
[Outro]
Who's your baby, who's your baby
Who's your baby, who's your baby
