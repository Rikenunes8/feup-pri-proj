- Beginning of the Second Movement -
[Verse 1]
She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the one-one-one-wonderful
[Verse 2]
She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket
Quite young and loving her mother and father
[Verse 3]
Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess, the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her one-one-one-wonderful
[Verse 4]
All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer
And all that's left is a girl
Who's loved by her mother and father
[Verse 5]
She'll return in love with her liberty
Chased away from the non believer
She'll sigh and thank God for one- one- one- wonderful
