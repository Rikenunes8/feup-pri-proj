[Intro]
Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
I nearly went out of my mind
I miss your loving when you left, baby you did
[Verse 1]
Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby your letters told me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt a long time ago
Ah come, baby, and get to this
[Verse 2]
Ooh, remember, baby, how you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I can’t wait, baby
I'm ready for you to start doing the things
I’m trying to blow your mind
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I can’t wait
Come here, come here, baby, get to this
[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
To have you back, everything else will have to, to get back
Oh, nothing's changed, you're still sweet as morning rain
And I'm standing ready to
Love you, baby, make it good to you
[Bridge]
Ohhh, I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh, I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this
[Outro]
Girl, I know you've been gone a real long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, babe, so glad that you’re home, oh baby
