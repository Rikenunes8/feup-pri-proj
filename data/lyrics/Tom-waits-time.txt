[Verse 1]
Well the 
smart money
's on Harlow
And the moon is in the street
The shadow boys are breaking all the laws
And you're east of East St. Louis
And the wind is making speeches
And the rain sounds like a round of applause
Napoleon
 is weeping in the Carnival saloon
His invisible fiance is in the mirror
And the band is going home
It's raining hammers
It's raining nails
Yes, it's true, there's nothin' left for him down here
[Chorus]
Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time
[Verse 2]
And they all pretend they're orphans
And their memory's like a train
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
And the things you can't remember
Tell the things you can't forget that
History puts a saint in every dream
Well she said she'd stick around
Until the bandages came off
But these mama's boys just don't know when to quit
And 
Matilda asks the sailors
Are those dreams or are those prayers?
So close your eyes, son
And this won't hurt a bit
[Chorus]
Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time[Verse 3]
Well, things are pretty lousy for a 
calendar girl
The boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street
And 
when they're on a roll
She pulls a razor from her boot
And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet
So put a candle in the window
 and a kiss upon his lips
As the dish outside the window fills with rain
Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
And pay the fiddler off till I come back again
[Chorus]
Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time
