[Verse 1]
Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
It's a big, black sky over my town
I know where you at, I bet she's around
[Refrain]
Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself
[Chorus]
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own (I keep dancing on my own)
[Verse 2]
I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line
Stilettos on broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles
[Chorus]
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own (I keep dancing on my own)
[Bridge]
So far away, but still so near
The lights go on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
[Chorus]
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own, oh, yeah (I keep dancing on my own)
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own (I keep dancing on my own)[Outro]
I keep dancing on my own
