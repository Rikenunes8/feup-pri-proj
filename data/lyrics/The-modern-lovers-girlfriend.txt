If I were to walk to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
Well, first I'd go to the room where they keep the CÃ©zanne
But if I had by my side a girlfriend
Then I could look through the paintings
I could look right through them
Because I'd have found something that I understand
I understand a girlfriend
That's a girl friend
Said G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N
That's a girlfriend, baby
That's something that I understand
Alright
I walk through the Fenway
I have my heart in my hands
I understand a girlfriend
That's a girl friend
Oh that's a G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N
Well that's a girlfriend, baby
That's something that I understand
Four o'clock in the afternoon in the Fenway
I have my heart in my hands
I undertand a girlfriend
That's a girlfriend
That's G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N
That's a girlfriend, baby
Well that's something that I understand
