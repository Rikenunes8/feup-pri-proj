[Intro: Rev Run & 
DMC

This speech is my recital
, I think it's very vital
To rock 
a rhyme
 that's right 
on time
, "It's Tricky" is the title (Here we go)
[Chorus: Rev Run, 
DMC
, & 
Both

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
It's tricky, 
tricky
, tricky, 
tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tricky, 
tricky
, tricky
[Verse 1: DMC & 
Rev Run

I met this little girlie, her hair was kind of curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is, "Please me"
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said, "It's not that easy"
[Chorus: DMC, 
Rev Run
, & 
Both

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky

How is it D?
)
It's tricky, 
tricky
, tricky, 
tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky

In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really 
hawk
, but we just 
walk
 because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
[Chorus: DMC, 
Rev Run
, & 
Both
]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
 (
How is it D?
)
Tricky, 
tricky
, tricky, 
tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, 
tricky
, tricky, 
tricky
, 
huh
[Verse 3: DMC & 
Rev Run

When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me[Chorus: DMC, 
Rev Run

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky

How is it?
)
Tricky, 
tricky
, tricky, 
tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky, tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tr

We are not thugs, 
we don't use drugs
, but you assume 
on your own
They offer coke 
and lots of dope
, but we just leave it alone
It's like that, y'all
, y'all, 
but we don't quit
You keep on 
rock
 shock 
'cause this is it
