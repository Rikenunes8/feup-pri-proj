[Verse 1]
Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby, with you
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you
[Chorus]
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
(Lonely avenue) Yes sir
[Verse 2]
Now my covers, they feel like lead
And my pillow, it feels like stone
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you[Chorus]
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Yes sir (lonely avenue)
Lonely avenue
Lonely avenue
[Verse 3]
Now I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be highway bound
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you
[Chorus]
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die) Oh ooh, yeah
I live on a lonely avenue
Lonely avenue
