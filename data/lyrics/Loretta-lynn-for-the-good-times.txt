[Verse]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and loving body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
[Verse]
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here, if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and loving body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
