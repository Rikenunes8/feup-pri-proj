[Verse 1]
It's automatic when I talk with old friends
The conversation turns to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go
[Verse 2]
With suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine
The 
California girls
 and a beautiful coastline
And warmed-up weather, let's
Get together and do it again
[Chorus]
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-de-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
[Bridge]
With a girl, the lonely sea looks good
With moonlight
Makes your night times warm
And out of sight (Been so long)
Do, do, do-do-do (Been so long)
Do, do, do-do-do (So long, been so long)
Been so long
[Guitar Solo]
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
[Verse 3]
Well, I've been thinking 'bout all the places
We surfed and danced and all the faces
We miss, so let's get
Back together and do it again
(Come and do it)[Outro]
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-de-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-doâ€¦
