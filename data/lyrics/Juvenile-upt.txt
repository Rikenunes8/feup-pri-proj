[Intro: B.G. & Baby]
Cash Money slangin' iron, nigga
(Off top, playboy)
H.B's and The B.G.'s
(What's happenin' little B. Geezy, bring it to these niggas)
[Verse 1: B.G.]
When I got that iron in my hand, I'ma slang it
When I got that drama on my mind, I'ma bring it
I ain't backin' down from no nigga, that's nathan'
If the nigga say I ain't bout my business, look here he hatin'
[Verse 2: Baby]
Coming uptown playboy, we gon' slang it
I catch you down bad nigga, we gon' leave ya stankin'
Fucking wit my H.B's nigga, I'm gon' bring it
Rollin' uptown, stay strapped and keep thinkin'
[Verse 3: B.G.]
Cause a nigga get stolen
Better yet get taken
K bullets burn
They come fast, ya can't shake it
Picture this my brother, Cash Money done went nation
But that comes from seven hard years of dedication
[Verse 4: Baby]
Fuckin' with my B.G. nigga
I'm puttin' it on your face and I'm a kill me a nigga
Best believe we worth six figures we call hard hitters
We uptown riders and we real with this nigga, nigga
[Verse 5: B.G.]
Police could investigate but they ain't gon' find shit
But a hundred bullet shells without a fucking fingerprint
This Hot Boy click laid back and spy on niggas
We see they workin' with somethin', look we ride on niggas
Ain't like rookie niggas
Any block we abuse it
That goes for the boss too
We ain't got no picks to choose it
We'll getcha if you got it
We'll split 'cha if we gotta
I know you done got word that B. Geezy is a rider
So keep it on the D.L
If you got keys, don't serve nobody off V.L
Cause they play for keeps
A one way ticket to hizell
Six feet deep
It's a filthy dirty wiz-erld
On the U.P.T
I was raised in the streets
But I put it on my mind
By the time I was nine
I was pushin' nigga
I was slangin' that iron[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Na, Na, Na, Na
Now them them don't want us
They know me and Turk gon' bust, spinnin' corners
They already know we brothers, blood
Or whatever you wan' call it
Click up wit my dog, we get crazy like alcoholics
Plus we ballers
So whatever we spin the bend in, Lex or Benz
It's gon' be on twenty, twen, twens
[Verse 7: Turk]
Get off the block when we come nigga (nigga)
To the lane
Shots that close shop when the bullets start spraying
Run your mouth too much, better watch what cha sayin'
Like a nigga on the sideline, nigga we ain't playin'
[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Na, Na, Na, Na
Now why, oh why Lord
Did the nigga wanna try and die hard?
Buh bye bye bye
[Interlude: Turk]
Niggas wanna learn hard way
Give it to 'em like that
Make 'em suffer, chop his hands
And hit the bitch wit a bat[Verse 8: Juvenile]
I guess you probably standin' there sayin, "Who's the muthafucka?"
Nigga Juv's the muthafucka, that'll bruise a muthafucka
Lately there's been a lot of cross-firin' in the bricks
And I'm gonna kill me a nigga
If they put me in that shit
Look, I'm gonna tell ya like I tell my folks
Play with me if you want, Cash Money goin' broke
Even if it means creepin' up slow
Bustin' out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no hoes
She could have had a girl for that
I been realized, I'm all in
Surrounded by the camouflage, in ballin'
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin'
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin', stop callin'
Cause ain't no peace treaties, whodie
You better not leave that forty-five at your house cause you gonna need it, whodie
I told you boy, I'm a solja boy
U.T.P up on my stomach, from the 'Nolia boy
I'm slangin' iron
[Outro: B.G.]
Fo sho nigga
That's how we layin' it down for the ninety-eight all the way to the ninety-nine
Worldwide
Slangin' iron
All you busta ass niggas better recognize
[Outro: Juvenile]
This one here bezzeled out, ya heard me?
Ask my nigga Prime, nigga
Ask my nigga Lac, nigga
Ask my nigga B Dog, nigga
Ask Mannie
Ask Rusty
Ask my thug Corey
Ask B. Geezy, nigga

[Outro: B.G.]
You ain't got no muthafuckin' heart
Got the butcher knife killin' in the back, ya heard me?
Slicing throats, we doin' it like that, nigga
Uh-huh, Uh-huh
How you love that, nigga?
What's up now nigga?
Talk that shit now
What, What's up
I thought we was what kind of boys
Nigga what, nigga who what, nigga ha
[Outro: Juvenile]
I know y'all gonna hear me all over the nation
So this is for the East Coast, the South Coast, the West Coast, over the world
Nigga it ain't no beef, nigga
It's bout money
Nigga if you ain't making no money, I can't talk
[Outro: B.G.]
Shut the fuck up
Nigga ain't got no words for ya
