They closed down all the bars
Clubs and theatres
Where am I 'posed to sing my song
Where the only place that I belong
Is amongst the madding throng
They closed down all the bars
Academies and festivals
So how am I 'posed to sing my song
Where the only place that I belong
Amongst the madding throng
You kicked me in the head
And when you kicked me in the head
How am I supposed to sing my song
When the only place that I belong
Amongst the madding throng
They locked up all the bars
Closed down the theatres
Where can I play my song?
The only place that I belong
Is amongst the madding throng
You kicked me in the head
Yeah, when you kicked me in the head
I just can't play my songs
The only place that I belong
Amongst the madding throng
Yeah, you kicked me in the head
If you kick me in the head
I just can't sing my songs
Only place that I belong
Is amongst the madding throng
