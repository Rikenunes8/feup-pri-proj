[Verse 1]
Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You've stripped my heart, ripped it apart
In the name of fun
Oh, Lillian
I'm a poor man's son
And precious jewels weren't found in schools
Where I came from
[Refrain]
Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got
[Verse 2]
Oh, Lillian
I should have run
I should have known each dress you own
Is a loaded gun
[Chorus]
Oh, Lillian
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Oh, Lillian
I need protection
I hear your voice and any choice
I had is gone
Oh, Lillian
Once I began
I couldn't stop till every drop
Of blood was sung
[Refrain]
Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got
[Verse 4]
Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You stripped my heart, ripped it apart
In the name of fun[Chorus]
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
