[Intro]
Stop it!
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Darling, don't you go and cut your hair
Do you think it's gonna make him change?
I'm just a boy with a new haircut
And that's a pretty nice haircut
Charts are like a puzzle, hitmen wearing muzzles
Hesitate, you die
Look around, around
The second drummer drowned
His telephone is found
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Music scene is crazy, bands start up
Each and every day
I saw another one just the other day
A special new band
I don't remember lying, I don't remember a line
I don't remember a word
But I don't care, I care, I really don't care
Did you see the drummer's hair?
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
"Advertiser looks and chops a must
No big hair!"
Songs mean a lot when songs are bought
And so are you
Face right down to the practice room
Attention and fame's a career
Career, career, career
Career, career[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
