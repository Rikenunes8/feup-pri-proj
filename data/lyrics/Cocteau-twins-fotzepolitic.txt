My dreams are alone and sick and must be addressed
They’re a young girl’s dreams
True, some do, it is true
Like the barely-lit stars
But I was just cute
Like the scary hairs on my singing hoof
Like the scary hairs on our singing hoofs
They cough
A family fool, well it’s you
I can ladle inside me
You’ll accept my feint
A Kalends start, but I feel strung up
And bound, no way to
But I’m empty-headed
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
Will you?
My dreams are alone and sick and must be addressed
They’re a young girl’s dreams
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
Will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
Will you?
