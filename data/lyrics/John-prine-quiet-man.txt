[Verse 1]
Strolling down the highway with my shoes in my hand
I don't talk much, I'm a quiet man
Beauty and silence both run deep
And I'm running like crazy while you are asleep
[Chorus]
You got news for me
I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to
[Verse 2]
Last Monday night, I saw a fight
Between Wednesday and Thursday over Saturday night
Tuesday asked me what was going on
I said, "Sunday's in the meadow and Friday's in the corn"
[Chorus]
You got news for me
I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to
[Verse 3]
Hocus-pocus, maladjusted
Don't you think my tears get rusted?
Steady losing means you ain't using
What you really think is right
[Chorus]
You got news for me
I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to
[Instrumental Break][Verse 4]
Oodles of light, what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man
Oodles of light, what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man
Oodles of light, what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man
