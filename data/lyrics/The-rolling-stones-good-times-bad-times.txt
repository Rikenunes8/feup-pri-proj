[Verse 1]
There've been good times
There've been bad times
I have my share of hard times too
But I lost my faith in the world
Honey, when I lost you
[Verse 2]
Remember the good times
We've had together?
Don't you want them back again?
Though these hard times are bugging me now
Honey now it's a sin
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 3]
There's gotta be trust in this world
Or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone
Or there's gonna be war
