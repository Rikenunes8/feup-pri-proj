[Verse 1]
I don't remember when the liquor started kicking in
It's been a while since I been off the stuff
I really hate to say I'm turning into a clich√©
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up
I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive of shame
And last night's clothes, they smell like smoke
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head'll hurt all day
[Chorus]
But I still go and stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeos and Juliets
Have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on
[Verse 2]
Well, everybody's got a spark
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings
I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The married men, the exit door
The beginning of another matchbook fling
And I don't try to justify
The reason I'm not living right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir
I drink too much to fall apart
That's how I fight this broken heart
So what if I feel comfortable in here?
[Chorus]
'Cause I still go and stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeos and Juliets
Have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on
Hey
