Kid, what changed your mood?
You got all sad, so I feel sad too
I think I know
Some things you never outgrow
You think it's wrong
I can tell you do
How can I explain
When you don't want me to?
Kid, my only kid
You look so small, you've gone so quiet
I know you know
What I'm about, I won't deny it
But you forget
You don't understand
You've turned your head
You've dropped my hand
All my sorrows
All my blues
All my sorrows
Shut the light
Go away
Full of grace
You cover your face
Kid, precious kid
Your eyes are blue, but you won't cry, I know
Angry tears are too dear
You won't let them go
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
