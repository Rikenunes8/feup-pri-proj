If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the nightbird song
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees that worship the wind
And if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room filled with empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes, that I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
The good's gone from goodbye
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
