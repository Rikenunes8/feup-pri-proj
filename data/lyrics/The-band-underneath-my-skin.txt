You tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me you want me
But I know you'll do anything to get a little attention
And lately, I've been doing everything to forget our history
'Cause you push me and you pull my heart in every direction

When you call me up in the dead of night, saying
"Wish that we had never said goodbye"
And you're beggin' me to go and call a cab
So we can take another stab at it
Every time you say
You wanna do it again
I'm fallin' right back in
I don't know how you
Always find a way
To get stuck in my head
I hate how long you've been
Underneath my skin

Now I'm sleeping over, waking up inside your apartment
We've been down this road a thousand times, I'm not tryin' to start shit
I'm so sick of all the promises you make when you're wasted
But I fall for it every time that I see you naked

When you call me up in the dead of night, saying
"Wish that we had never said goodbye"
And you're beggin' me to go and call a cab
So we can take another stab at it

Every time you say
You wanna do it again
I'm fallin' right back in
I don't know how you
Always find a way
To get stuck in my head
I hate how long you've been
Underneath my skin
When you pull me close
I hope you know

Every time you say
You wanna do it again
I'm fallin' right back in
Every time you say
You wanna do it again
I'm fallin' right back in
I don't know how you
Always find a way
To get stuck in my head
I hate how long you've been
Every time you say
You wanna do it again
I'm fallin' right back in (Underneath my skin)
I don't know how you
Always find a way
To get stuck in my head
I hate how long you've been
Underneath my skin
