[Verse 1]
Every day I try so hard to know your mind
And find out what's inside you
Time goes on and I don't know just where you are
Or how I'm going to find you
You can do whatever you please (Do you always)
The world's waiting to be seized (Want to really love)
You can collect all the neglect
Or all the self-respect you need (What you need)
[Chorus]
And I know
And I know
And I know
Your mind's guaranteed
It's all you'll ever need
So what do you want with me?
[Verse 2]
We live but once but good things can be found around
In spite of all the sorrow
If you see black you can't look back
You can't look front you cannot face tomorrow
Some have it nice (Fat and round)
Flash paradise
They're very wise to their disguise (They may be wise, but)
Trying to revolutionize tomorrow
[Chorus]
And I know
And I know
And I know
Your mind's guaranteed
It's all you'll ever need
So what do you want with me?
