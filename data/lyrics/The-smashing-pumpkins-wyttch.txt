[Verse 1]
Samhain, Samhain
Through this harvest, tread nigh
All hallows' eve
Samhain, Samhain
Under mask, I am stars
Love, lie with thee
All hallows' eve
[Verse 2]
Samhain, Samhain
Take my hand, vex moonlight
Midheaven
 wanes
All hallows' eve
[Chorus]
Black turns forever turns to sleep
Black turns confessor turns to reap
[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Come call, Autumnus
Start the wheels of Helios
Strike up the lantern
Singe forth darkest peace
We'll follow under
[Verse 3]
Samhain, Samhain
Awaken spirits in thy breath
Love, lie with thee
Samhain, Samhain
Gifting apples that I'd spoilt
To Hallowmass
Love, lie with thee
[Chorus]
Black turns forever turns to sleep
Black turns confеssor turns to reap
[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Hey
Comе call, Autumnus
Start the wheels of Helios
Strike up the lantern[Chorus]
Black turns forever turns to sleep
Black turns confessor turns to reap
Black turns sinless turns to seed
Black turns protectress turns to reap
[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Come call, Autumnus
