I'm gonna sail away from sorrow
Gonna leave first thing tomorrow
Since I met you my life is not worth while
I'm gonna sail away from sadness
Into a land of gladness
Why was I so disillusioned by your smile
I'm gonna sail away tomorrow
Get away from all my sorrow
I may live on an island in the sea
I may find joy in some green valley
Be a bum, live in an alley
But I'll be happy
Long as you're not there with me
I'm gonna sail away from sorrow
Into a bright tomorrow
Maybe there I'll find somebody new
You made our love a thing of sadness
My heart a heart of madness
Oh, I pray that I will never think of you
I'm gonna sail away from sorrow
Gonna leave first thing tomorrow
I'm leaving you and everything I own
So, go on out and have the fun you love
What I have paid is small enough
To get away from the sadness that I've known
So, go on out and have the fun you love
What I have paid is small enough
To get away from the sadness that I've known
