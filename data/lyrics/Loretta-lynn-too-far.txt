[Verse]
I gave you everything
I thought I'd wear your ring someday on my finger
In love so blind, I stepped across the line
Now just memories of you linger
[Chorus]
Just like a child, I wished upon a star
Sometimes a girl in love will go too far
[Verse]
I was a crazy fool, let my heart overrule
Each decision my mind was makin'
The harm is done, there is no place to run
You can't give me back what you've taken
[Chorus]
I gave my all, now I don't know where you are
Sometimes a girl in love will go too far
[Bridge]
Too far, oh yes, too far
Sometimes a girl in love will go too far
[Verse]
But I know I was smart
For in a little while, I'll be holdin' somebody new
A little girl, a tiny baby girl
And I know she will look like you[Chorus]
And she'll be loved just the same way that you are
Sometimes a girl in love will go too far
