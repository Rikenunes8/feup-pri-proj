[Verse 1]
They tell us that we lost our tails
Evolving up from little snails
I say it's all just wind in sails
[Chorus]
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? D-E-V-O!
[Verse 2]
We're pinheads now, we are not whole
We're pinheads all
 
Jocko Homo
[Chorus]
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? D-E-V-O!
Are we not pins? We are Devo!
[Verse 3]
Monkey men all in business suits
Teachers and critics all dance the poot
[Chorus]
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? D-E-V-O!
Are we not pins? We are Devo!
Are we not men? D-E-V-O!
[Bridge]
All together now: God made man
But he used the monkey to do it
Apes in the plan
We're all here to prove it
I can walk like an ape, talk like an ape
I can do what monkey do
God made man
But a monkey supplied the glue
[Breakdown]
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo!
Are we not men? We are Devo![Outro]
