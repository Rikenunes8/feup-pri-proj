[Chorus]
Hey, good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe?
[Verse 1]
I got a brand new car and a two dollar bill
Yeah, know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin' free
So if you wanna have fun, come along with me
[Chorus]
So, hey, good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
[Verse 2]
I got a brand new Ford and a two dollar bill, alright
I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin' free
So if you wanna have fun, come along with me
[Chorus]
So, hey, good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
[Outro]
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
