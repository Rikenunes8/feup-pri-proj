[Verse 1]
You took the car, it was my favorite one
Little white Dart, and drove it to Idaho
You took the horse, it was a thoroughbred
Saddled it up out on the interstate
[Verse 2]
You killed the cat, burned it in antifreeze
Dumped in the trunk with the rest of the cattle-feed
You took the house, you went and changed the locks
Now I am stuck living out of a box
[Verse 1]
You took the car, it was my favorite one (
I think I've been taken
)
Little white Dart, and drove it to Idaho
You took the horse, it was a thoroughbred (
For everything I own
)
Saddled it up out on the interstate
[Verse 2]
You killed the cat, burned it in antifreeze (
I've been hurt so badly
)
Dumped in the trunk with the rest of the cattle-feed
You took the house, you went and changed the locks (
I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
)
Now I am stuck living out of a box
[Chorus]
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing (
I think I've been taken
)
You left me nothing (
For everything I own
)
Johnny Sunshine (
I've been hurt so badly
)
You left me nothing (
I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
)
You left me nothing (
I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
)
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing
You
