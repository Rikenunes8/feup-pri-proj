[Verse 1]
I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I never lie
And if you're evil, I'll forgive you by and by
, 'cause...
[Chorus]
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you
[Verse 2]
I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah, and you're the reason why, 'cause...
[Chorus]
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you, woo!
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
You're just a sinner, I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human
I'm a dove
I'm your conscience
I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe[Chorus]
Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you
Yeah, say one more time
You, I would die for you
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you
Two, three, four, you!
[Outro]
I would die for you
I would die for you
You, I would die for you
You, I would die for you
