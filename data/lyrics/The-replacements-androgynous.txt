[Verse 1]
Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain
Same hair, revolution
Same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?
[Chorus]
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous
[Verse 2]
Don't get him wrong and don't get him mad
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
And she don't need advice that'll center her
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
[Chorus]
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous
[Bridge]
Mirror image, see no damage
See no evil at all
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at
The way you're laughed at now
[Verse 3]
Now, something meets Boy, and something meets Girl
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
Same hair, revolution
Unisex, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
And tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today, the people dress the way that they please
The way they tried to do in the last centuries[Chorus]
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous
[Ending]
