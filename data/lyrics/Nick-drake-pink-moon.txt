[Verse]
I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get ye all
And it's a pink moon
Yes, a pink moon
Pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon
A pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon
[Verse]
I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get ye all
It's a pink moon
Yes, a pink moon
