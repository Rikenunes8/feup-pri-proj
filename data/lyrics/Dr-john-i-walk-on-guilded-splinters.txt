Some people think they jive me
But I know they must be crazy
Don't see dey misfortune
Guess they just too lazy
J'suis le Grand Zombie
My yellow belt of choison
Ain't afraid of no tom cat
Fill my brains with poison
Walk thru the fire
Fly thru the smoke
See my enemy
At the end of dey rope
Walk on pins and needles
See what they can do
Walk on guilded splinters
King of the Zulu
Come Get It, Get It, Come, Come
Walk on guilded splinters
'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up, 'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up
I rolled out my coffin
Drink poison in my chalice
Pride begins to fade
And y'all feel my malice
Put 
gris-gris
 on your doorstep
Soon you'll be in the gutter
Melt your heart like butter
A-a-and I can make you stutter
Come Get It, Get It, Come, Come
Walk on guilded splinters
Come Get It, Get It, Come, Come
Walk on guilded splinters
'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up, 'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn UpCome Get It, Get It, Come, Come
Walk on guilded splinters
Coco Robichaux

With your Coco Robichaux
With your Coco Robichaux
'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up, 'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up
'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up, 'Til I Burn Up ,'Til I Burn Up
