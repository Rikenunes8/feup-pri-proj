When tomorrow comes, I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of the things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found, lost hope that I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark, but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes
Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark, but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
'Cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, you're my flashlight, oh

I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not afraid when the rain won't stop
'Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way

I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark, but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes
Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark, but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Light, light, light, you're my flashlight
Light, light, you're my flashlight, light, light, light, light, oh
You're my flashlight, oh-ohh

I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see the sweet life (You and I)
I'm stuck in the dark, but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes (Shine it in my eyes)
Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life (Sweet life)
I'm stuck in the dark but, you're my flashlight (You're my flashlight)
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night

'Cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, you're my flashlight
Oh-ohh oh-ohhh ohhhh ohh
You're my flashlight, light, light
You're my flashlight, light, light, yeah
(Light, light, light, you're my flashlight, light, light)
You're my flashlight
