[Verse 1]
Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ahh-ah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
[Chorus 1]
And I can't tell you why
[Verse 2]
When we get crazy, it just ain't right
(Try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
[Chorus 2]
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
[Chorus 3]
And I can't tell you why
No, no baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why[Outro Guitar Solo]
