[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing
By myself, gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (Solo), solo (Solo)
S-solo (Solo), s-solo (Solo)
[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo
[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw, though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smoking big, rolling solo[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo
Solo
Solo (By myself)
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo
