[Intro]
Yeah! Alright!
[Chorus]
Sitting down by my window
Honey, looking out at the rain
Lord, Lord, Lord, sitting down by my window
Baby, looking out at the rain
Something came along, grabbed a hold of me
And it felt just like a ball and chain
Honey, that's exactly what it felt like
Honey, just dragging me down
[Verse]
And I say, oh, whoa, whoa, now hun, tell me why
Why does every single little tiny thing I hold on goes wrong?
Yeah it all goes wrong, yeah
And I say, oh, whoa, whoa, now babe, tell me why
Why does every thing, every thing
Hey, here you gone today, I wanted to love you
Honey, I just wanted to hold you, I said, for so long
Yeah! Alright! Hey!
Love's got a hold on me, baby
Feels just like a ball and chain
Now, love's just dragging me down, baby, yeah
Feels like a ball and chain
I hope there's someone out there who could tell me
Why the man I love wants to leave me in so much pain
Yeah, maybe, maybe you could help me, come on, help me!
And I say, oh, whoa, whoa, now hun, tell me why
Now tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me why, yeah
And I say, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, when I ask you
When I need to know why, come on tell me why, hey hey hey
Here you've gone today
I wanted to love you and hold you
Until the day I die
I said whoa, whoa, whoa!!And I say oh, whoa, whoa, no honey
It isn't fair, daddy it isn't fair what you do
I see what you're doing to me and you know it isn't fair
And I say oh, whoa whoa now baby
It isn't fair, now, now, now, what you do
I said hun it isn't fair what, hun it isn't fair what you do
Oh, here you gone today and all I ever wanted to do
Was to love you
Honey and I think there can be nothing wrong with that
Only it isn't wrong, no, no, no, no, no
[Chorus]
[Outro]
And I say oh, whoa whoa, now baby
This can't be, no this can't be in vain
And I say no no no no no no no no, whoa!
And I say whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Now now now now now now now now now, no no, not in vain
Hey, hope there is someone that could tell me
Hun, tell me why
Hun, tell me why love is like
Just like a ball
Just like a ball
Ball
Oh daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy
And a chain
Yeah!
