[Intro]
Do, do doot
Do do, do doot
[Chorus]
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
[Verse 1]
Girl really wants you then
Don't you see you got to
Give her all the loving that she needs
Have a try
Try it one more time
Have a try
Try it one more time
[Chorus]
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Give her lovin' that's a little stronger
Give her loving that's a little stronger
[Verse 2]
If you with your baby when the day turns to night
You got to give her loving
Make her feel all right, it's all right
It's all right
Try one more time
It's all right[Chorus]
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Say goodnight and stay a little longer
Say goodnight but stay a little longer
[Verse 3]
Have to keep her from crying
Then you got to try to work pretty hard
To keep her satisfied
Just try, try it one more time
Try it one more time
Have a try
[Outro]
Try a little bit harder
Try a little bit harder
Try a little bit harder
Try a little harder
Try a little harder
If you're with your baby when the day turns to night
You got to give her loving
Make her feel all right
Got to try
