There was a day, now dig this
There was a dance they call The Jerk
Everybody, relax, and watch me work, OH!
In my hometown where I used to stay
The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together, any type of weather
Then we do the Camel Walk, OH!
Looka here, dig this
Now there was a dance that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
You’ll never hear me holler
I'll do the best that I can do, OH!
Looka here, feeling good
There was a time, sometimes I dance, looka here
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet
Until you see me do the James Brown, OH!
Dig this, do you feel alright?
Said do you feel alright?
Feel pretty good myself
Looka here, now I got a little groovemaker
Something I like to do
Since we’re here, we might as well get the best out of it
If it's all night, it's all right
Looka here
You ready, band?
Dancers, you ready?
You ready, audience?
Alright, you ready, Flames?
You ready again?
