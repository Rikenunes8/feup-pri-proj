I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if I'm old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind, and I don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, way' from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, fraid' ,ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't even care, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
We could have it all, we could have all three
