[Part I: "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)"]
[Verse 1]
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have-not's
Money, we make it
Before we see it, you take it
[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
(Yeah) Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't living, this ain't living
No, no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no, no
[Verse 2]
Inflation, no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life (He-ey-ey)
Yeah, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Oh, baby[Verse 3]
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh, honey that I can't pay my taxes
[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Yeah, it make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands (Ow!)
[Verse 4]
Crime is (Woo!) increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading
[Outro]
Oh, baby
Make me wanna holler, they don’t understand
Yeah, make me wanna holler, they don’t understand
[Part II: "What's Going On" Reprise]
Mother, mother (Mother, mother)
Everybody thinks we're wrong (Mother, mother)
Who are they to judge us? (Mother, mother)
Simply 'cause we wear our hair long (Mother, mother)
Ooh
Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Oh
