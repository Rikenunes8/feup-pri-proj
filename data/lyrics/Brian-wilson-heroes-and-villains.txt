- Beginning of the First Movement -
[Verse 1]
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains
[Verse 2]
Once at night cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain
Of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains
[Hook]
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Na, na, na, na, na[Verse 3]
La, la, la, la, la, la
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains
(Wordless vocals)
[Bridge]
In the cantina
Margarita keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and 'round in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance
Dance Margarita, don't you know that I love you?
Dance
You're under arrest
[Verse 4]
My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and wise
[Verse 5]
I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff, I'm alright
By the heroes and[Hook]
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
