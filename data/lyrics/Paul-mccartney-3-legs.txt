[Verse 1]
Well, when I walk, when I walk
Walk my horse up on the hill (When I walk my horse upon a hill)
Well, when I walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk my horse up on the hill (When I walk my horse upon a hill)
When I lay me down
Will my lover love me still?
[Chorus 1]
A dog is here (A dog is here)
A dog is there (A dog is there)
My dog, he got three legs
But he can't run
[Verse 2]
Well, when I thought, well, I thought
When I thought you was my friend
(When I thought that I could call you my friend)
When I thought, well, I thought
When I thought you was my friend
(When I thought that I could call you my friend)
But you let me down (hoo!)
Put my heart around the bend
[Chorus 2]
A fly flies in (A fly flies in)
A fly flies out (A fly flies out)
Most flies they got three legs
But mine got one
[Verse 3]
Well, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly
When I fly above the clouds
(When I fly above the maddening crowd)
Oh, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly
When I fly above the clouds
(When I fly above the maddening crowd)
You can knock me down with a feather, yes, you could
But you know it's not allowed (But you know it's not allowed)[Chorus 1]
A dog is here (A dog is here)
A dog is there (A dog is there)
My dog, he got three legs
But he can't run
[Outro]
My dog he got three legs
Your dog he got none
My dog he got three legs
Your dog he got none
My dog he got three legs
Your dog he got none
