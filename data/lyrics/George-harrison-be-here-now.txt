[Verse 1]
Remember now, be here now
As it's not like it was before
The past was, be here now
As it's not what it was before it was
[Bridge]
Why try to live a life
That isn't real
No how
A mind that wants to wander
'Round a corner
Is an unwise mind
[Verse 2]
Now is, be here now
And it's not what it was before
Remember now, be here now
As it's not like it was before it was
