[Verse 1]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with m
e
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off
[Verse 2]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical words
[Chorus]
Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable
[Verse 3]
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff
[Chorus]
Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandableCheer up, honey, I hope you can
