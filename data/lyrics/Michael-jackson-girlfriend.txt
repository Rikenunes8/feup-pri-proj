Girlfriend
I'm gonna tell your boyfriend (Yeah)
Tell him (Woohoo)
Exactly what we're doin' (Yeah)
Tell him what you do to me
Late at night when the wind is free
[Verse 2]
Girlfriend
I'm gonna show your boyfriend (Yeah)
Show him (Woohoo)
The letters I've been savin' (Yeah)
Show him how you feel inside
And how love could not be denied (Oh no)

We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Huh, do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do-do (Hoo)

You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Exactly what we're doin' (Yeah)
Tell him what he needs to know
Or he may never let you go, yeah

You'll only be a girlfriend of mine
