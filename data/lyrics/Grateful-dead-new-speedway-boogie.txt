Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Heard some say: 
Better run away
Others say: 
You better stand still
Now I don't know but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead
Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?
Spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Do we keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late?
You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
Spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
I don't know but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too longOne way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
