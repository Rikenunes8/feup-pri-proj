[Verse 1]
Let me in here
I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
Let me know you
Let me show you
Let me roll it to you
[Chorus]
All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms
I'd have you anytime
[Verse 2]
Let me say it
Let me play it
Let me lay it on you
Let me know you
Let me show you
Let me grow upon you
[Chorus]
All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms
I'd have you anytime[Outro]
Let me in here
I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
