Come a little closer
Rest your head on my shoulder
Let me reassure you
That I'm here to stay
Always

'Cause we are living in a world
Where hearts change just like the weather
But I'll never take my heart away
Bringing you a never changing love
Endless and everlasting
Strong enough to stand
'Til the end of time
It will stay this way forever
Nothing will ever change
This never changing love
Oh, no

When you got a love that's built on solid emotion
Baby, it's a love that stands on solid ground
It will be around forever
Nothing in the world will change my love for you, baby
Nothing's ever gonna tear it down

You can change the world
You can change your name
You can change your mind
But you'll never change
(No, never change)

Never changing love (Never, ever change)
Endless and everlasting (Ooh, oh)
Strong enough to stand
'Til the end of time (Ooh)
It will stay this way forever
Nothing will ever change
This never changing love
We gonna rock these styles
We're gonna rock tonight
We're gonna rock these styles 'til broad daylight
Never changing here
Never changing there
Mi never gonna change mi love anywhere
Never change it
I'll never change mi love
Never change it, keep it the way it was
Never change it
I'll never change mi love
Never change it
Keep it the way it was

You can change your clothes
You can change you style
Turn this sad old tear
To a brand new smile
Turn a blue sky gray
Or a gray sky blue
But there ain't no changing my love
(No, never change)

Never changing love (Never changing love)
Endless and everlasting
Strong enough to stand
'Til the end of time
It will stay this way forever
Nothing will ever change
This never changing love
Never changing love
(It will never, nothing will ever, nothing will ever change)
Endless and everlasting
(Nothing will ever change)
Strong enough to stand
'Til the end of time
('Til the end of time)
It will stay this way forever
Nothing will ever change this never changing
It will stay this way forever
(Nothing will ever change my love)
Never, never
Never changing love, baby
(Oh no, never, never changing love)
Never, never (Never)
Never changing love, baby
Never, never (Never)
Never changing love, baby
It will stay this way forever
Never changing love, baby
