[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore
[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble
[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
[Verse 1]
Another reason why I love your ass
Your dancing like everyday could be your last
Do you, do you, do you want to dance
Lets get it on like black trash[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble
[Verse 2]
I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My God, that I have ever seen
Tearing up my seratonin
Messing with my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling smart again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would
Never let the perfect message
In and get the perfect screwing
Oh Yohanna love, oh, oh[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
[Bridge]
Number three reasons why I'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing, And a dancing machine
Somebody move, Somebody scream
Yeah
[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore
