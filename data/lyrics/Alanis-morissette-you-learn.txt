[Verse 1]
I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
Yeah, oh
I recommend walkin' around naked in your living room
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Swallow it down (What a jagged little pill)
It feels so good (Swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles
[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn
[Verse 2]
I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone
I certainly do
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
Feel free
[Pre-Chorus]
Throw it down (The caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (To the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears
[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn[Pre-Chorus]
Wear it out (The way a three-year-old would do)
Melt it down (You're gonna have to eventually anyway)
The fire trucks are comin' up around the bend
[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn
[Outro]
You grieve, you learn
You choke, you learn
You laugh, you learn
You choose, you learn
You pray, you learn
You ask, you learn
You live, you learn
