All the masses! Come feel irie!
Rejoice today, rejoice tonight.

When you see me passing by,
I'll be riding high like a kite.
Jah Jah say free your mind,
Keep faith, 'cause we live and not die. [2x]

Those who are in power, working iniquity.
Those in poverty, still trying to be meek.
The tables shall turn, in the afterlife.
So my brothers and sisters,
Rejoice for the goodness of life, feel alright.
Yea, feel alright! Rejoice tonight.

When you see me passing by,
I'll be riding high like a kite.
Jah Jah say free your mind,
Keep faith, 'cause we live and not die. [2x]

Dready:
Le canto a le gente que lucha y rez por paz.
Vengo a defender los derechos de la humanidad.
Venemos conbongo y cuerda, a cantar la cancion.
Venemos con fuerza a decir no, no Babylon.
Por que sera, que a la gente le encanta jusgar?
Solo abren la boca ellos, para blasfemar.
Pues date tiempo mi hermano pa' meditar.
Cultiva tu propia manera de pensar.

When you see me passing by,
I'll be riding high like a kite.
Jah Jah say free your mind,
Keep faith, 'cause we live and not die. [2x]

No we never die! No we never die!

Libertad! Libertad!

Trodden never fallen,
When I heard Jah Jah calling,
In the early of the morning.
Calming the proud talking,
Never stopping the use of medicine in I herbla garden.

Libertad - you can never take away,
My mental freedom! [2x]

Chanting these words haunting,
Foolish men who are plotting,
For the dark days that are coming.
Walking through the gauntlet,
Even if they were bombing,
They can't stop the Lion Conquering.
Libertad - you can never take away!

Libertad - you can never take away,
My mental freedom. [2x]

Libertad! Libertad!
