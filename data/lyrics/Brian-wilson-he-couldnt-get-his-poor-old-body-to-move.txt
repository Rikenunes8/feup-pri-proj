I guess you all know it's been a long, long time
Since the days of turnin' water to wine
Things ain't easy, but they always improve
When you go and get your poor old body to move
Why sit hypnotized
When you can feel alive?
Take my simple advice
You've gotta get your poor old body to move
Seven times seven and ten times ten
You've gotta pick it up and start all over again
It doesn't matter which step you choose
You've gotta get your poor old body to move
Why sit hypnotized
When you can feel alive?
Take my simple advice
You've gotta get your poor old body to move
Get along, get rollin' now
Get away, get away now
Let it out, let it out of here
Get along on your lazy way
On your lazy way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you're feeling lost and lonely, too
I'll bet sometimes you don't know what to do
Early in the morning when the sun shines through
That's when you get your poor old body to move
Why sit hypnotized
When you can feel alive?
Take my simple advice
You've gotta get your poor old body to move
Why sit hypnotized
When you can feel alive?
Take my simple advice
You've gotta get your poor old body to moveWhy sit hypnotized
When you can feel alive?
