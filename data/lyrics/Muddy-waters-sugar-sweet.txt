[Verse]
I want to tell about my baby, speak of her with pride
She go out of the way to make me satisfied
She's my baby, she's my baby, what a treat
Well, I can't call her sugar, sugar never was so sweet
Well, I am not no surprised, she serve me in the bed
She manicure my nails, scratch dandruff from my head
She's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see?
Well, I can't call her sugar, sugar never was so sweet
Sugar don't get that sweet, boy
And if I say what I want, that's the way it going to be
She fell over backwards, you know that pleases me
She's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see?
Well, I can't call her sugar, sugar never was so sweet
