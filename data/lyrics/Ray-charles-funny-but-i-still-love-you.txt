[Verse 1]
My dear sweetheart, I'm writing you
Just a few lines to tell you that I'm low
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you
[Verse 2]
You went away, didn't say goodbye
But I still love you, Lord, I wonder why
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you
[Bridge]
I don't know who was right or who was wrong
All I know is I'm so tired, so tired of being alone
[Verse 3]
But if you care like I care
Catch the next streamline, bring yourself back here
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you
[Verse 4]
I miss your loving, you know what I mean
Remember how you used to make me scream
Oh, baby, my baby
Funny, but I still love you
