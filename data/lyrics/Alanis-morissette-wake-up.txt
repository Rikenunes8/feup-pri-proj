[Verse 1]
You like snow, but only if it's warm
You like rain, but only if it's dry
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no sentimental value to the rose
That fell on your floor
There's no fundamental excuse
For the granted I'm taken for
[Chorus]
'Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you
[Verse 2]
You like pain, but only if it doesn't hurt too much
And you sit, and you wait to receive
[Pre-Chorus]
There's an obvious attraction
To the path of least resistance in your life
But there's an obvious aversion
No amount of my insistence could make you try tonight
[Chorus]
'Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you
To you, to you
To you
[Post-Chorus]
There's no love
No money
No thrill anymore
[Verse 3]
Well, there's an apprehensive, naked little trembling boy
With his head in his hands
And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl
Raising her hand[Chorus]
But it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you
[Outro]
Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get out, get out of here, enough already
Get up, get up, get up off of it
And wake up
