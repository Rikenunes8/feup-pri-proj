[Verse 1: Jermaine Jackson]
Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning
When you find your heart a home
[Verse 2: Whitney Houston]
I've seen it in the movies
Read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it
But your touch was all it took
[Chorus: Jermaine Jackson & Whitney Houston]
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart;
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it...
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart...
[Verse 3: Whitney Houston]
Come and make your magic
'Til you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer
I'll be drowning in your eyes
[Verse 4: Jermaine Jackson]
You're the one I needed most
When my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours
When I gave you mine...
[Chorus: Whitney Houston & Jermaine Jackson]
So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart;
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it...I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
(Take good care of me...)
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
(Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart...)
Won't you please...?
Baby, you're the first to take it
And you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
