[Verse 1]
Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away
Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it
Oh yes, my love has gone astray
[Chorus]
But I'll blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees
I'll blame it on the time that never was enough
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea
But my heart blames it on me
[Verse 2]
Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you (Wish I could tell you)
What I am feeling (What I am feeling)
But words won't come for me to speak
[Chorus]
Oh, but I'll blame it on the sun
That didn't fill the sky
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees
I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be
But my heart blames it on me
[Outro]
Yeah
Mm
(Your heart blames it on you this time)
