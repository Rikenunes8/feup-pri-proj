Yeah I, I've seen those girls
I think they look pretty cool
But, you know, one thing I, I ya know...
That whole attitude about, ya know
Dressing in the baggy clothes
It's, I dunno I, I'm not into that
I think it's kinda, kinda lame, ya know?
But, ah, maybe it's just one of those, you know, those black things
That, that people really get into, ya know?
It's just a fad, I think
They don't really look like, ya know, women really
They just look like, like they're tryna be
Ya know, just something else than what they really are
I dunno
But they're pretty cute!
