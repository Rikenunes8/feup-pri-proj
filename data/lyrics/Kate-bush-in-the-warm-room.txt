[Verse 1]
In the warm room
Her perfume reaches you
Eventually you'll fall for her
Down you'll go
To where the mellow wallows
[Verse 2]
In the warm room
She'll touch you with your Mamma's hand
You'll long to kiss those red lips
But when you do
It'll feel like kicking a habit
[Chorus]
She'll tell you that she'll stay
Ooh, so you'd better barricade the way out
She'll tell you she's true
She'll tell you she loves you
She's waiting in that warm room
[Verse 3]
In the warm room
She prepares to go to bed
She'll let you watch her undress
Go places where
Your fingers long to linger
[Verse 4]
In the warm room
You'll fall into her like a pillow
Her thighs are soft as marshmallows
Say hello
To the soft musk of her hollows
[Chorus]
She'll tell you that she'll stay
Ooh, so you'd better barricade the way out
She'll tell you she's true
She'll tell you she loves you
She's waiting in that warm room[Outro]
In the warm room
She's waiting in that warm room
