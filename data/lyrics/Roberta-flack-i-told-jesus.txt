[Verse 1]
I told Jesus be alright if you change my name
I told Jesus be alright if you changed, changed my name
I told Jesus be alright, be alright, be alright
I told Jesus be alright if you change my name
Mmm mmm mmm
[Verse 2]
Then He told me, he said the world will turn away from you, child, if I change your name
Yes, He told me, said the world will turn away from you, child, if I change your name
I told Jesus be alright, be alright, be alright
I told Jesus be alright if you change my name
Mmm mmm mmm
[Verse 3]
Then He told me, He said your father won't know you, child, if I change your name
Yes, He told me, said your mother won't know you, child, child, if I change your name
But I told Jesus, I said it would be alright, be alright, be alright
If my father turns away now, and my mother turn away now
Yes, my brother, my baby sister, turn away, turn away
I told Jesus be alright, if you change my name, change my name, change my name
[Outro]
If He changed my name
