[Verse 1]
Every finger in the room
Is pointing at me
I wanna spit in their faces
Then I get afraid of what that could bring
I got a bowling ball in my stomach
I got a desert in my mouth
Figures that my courage
Would choose to sell out now
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Just what God needs: one more victim
[Chorus]
Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in
Chains, oh oh oh
Chains, oh oh oh
[Verse 2]
Got a kick for a dog
Begging for love
I gotta have my suffering
So that I can have my cross
I know a cat named Easter
He says, "Will you ever learn?
You're just an empty cage girl if you kill the bird"
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Got enough guilt to start my own religion
[Chorus]
Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in
Chains, oh oh oh
Chains[Bridge]
Please, please
Save me
I cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Where are those angels when you need them?
[Chorus]
Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in
Chains
Chains, oh yes
In chains, oh oh oh oh
[Outro]
I'm never going back again
To crucify myself again, you know
Never going back again
To crucify myself every day, yes
