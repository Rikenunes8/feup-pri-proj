[Verse 1]
Down the street, you can hear her scream, "You're a disgrace!"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now, he stands outside
All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door, he leans, and starts a scene
But his tears fall, burn, and gard-all green
[Chorus 1]
And some castle made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually
[Verse 2]
An Indian brave, who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream, that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more, the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fight his first battle
But somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
[Chorus 2]
And some castle made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
Take it, Johnny
[Guitar Solo 1:49-2:02]
[Verse 3]
There was a young girl who was heart with a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin'
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more."
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden-winged ship is passin' my way."
But it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on goin'[Chorus 3]
And some castles made of sand
Slips into the sea, eventually
