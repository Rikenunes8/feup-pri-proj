[Verse 1: Chaka Khan]
So there is magic in his mind
Reflecting in his eyes
It's that mystery draws me to you
This kind of voodoo's hard to find
I detect a little gypsy in his smile
I think I'll stay for awhile
I need some lovin', it's my turn
I got a little fire left to burn
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Oh, if he would just remain
I'd show him how I could love him
Or I get the feeling that he knows me
From some other time before
Wonder how he could forget me
Can't explain why I'm comin' back for more
