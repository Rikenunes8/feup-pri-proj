[Verse 1]
What a performance tonight
Should I react or turn off the light?
Looks like you're picking a fight
In a blurring of wrong and right
But how your mood changes
You're a devil, now an angel
Suddenly subtle and solemn and silent as a monk
You only tell me you love me when you're drunk
[Verse 2]
It's better than nothing, I suppose
Some doors have opened, others closed
But I couldn't see you exposed
To the horrors behind some of those
Somebody said, "Listen
Don't you know what you're missing?
You should be kissing him instead of dissing him like
A punk"
But you only tell me you love me when you're drunk
You only tell me you love me when you're drunk
[Bridge]
All of my friends keep asking me
"Why? Oh, why
Do you not say goodbye?
If you don't even try
You'll be sunk"
'Cause you only tell me you love me when you're drunk
[Verse 3]
What's the meaning
When you speak with so much feeling?
Is it over when you're sober?
Is it junk?
You only tell me you love me when you're drunk
You only tell me you love me when you're drunk
