[Verse 1]
Snake in it, jack into the wall
TV amp on fire blowing in the hall
Gun your sled, close your peeping toms
Turbo organizer cranking on the knob
[Chorus]
You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket
[Verse 2]
Hit the power, psycho helmets on
You got to splice your halo, take it to a moon
Nymphoid clamor fueling up the hammer
You got to fake out the robot and pulse up the zoom
[Chorus]
You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket
[Verse 3]
Can't forget the flashing
Can't forget the smashing
The sending and the bending
The atmosphere re-entry
You gotta have the time
Got another in your mind
Got your heart injected
And you got your soul aligned[Chorus]
You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket
