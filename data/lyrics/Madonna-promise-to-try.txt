[Verse 1]
Little girl, don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain
[Verse 2]
Little girl, never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try
But it's not the same
[Chorus]
Keep your head held high
Ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care
[Verse 3]
Little girl, don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss
Kiss her goodbye
[Chorus]
Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall?
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call?
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right
[Bridge]
I fought to be so strong
I guess you knew
I was afraid
You'd go away too
[Verse 4]
Little girl, you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try
But it feels like a lie[Chorus]
Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on
But I'm doing it wrong
[Outro]
Can't kiss her goodbye
But I promise to try
