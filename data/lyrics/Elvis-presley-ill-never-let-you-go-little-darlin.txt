I'll never let you go, little darling
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry
I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you
So please don't ever say goodbye

The stars would tumble down beside me
The moon would hang its head and cry
My arms would never hold another baby doll
If we should ever say goodbye
Well, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, pretty baby
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry, I made you cry
Yeah, I'll never let you go
'Cause I love you, little baby
So please don't ever say goodbye
