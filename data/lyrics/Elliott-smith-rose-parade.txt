[Verse 1]
You asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
With a wink and a wave from the 
cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
[Chorus]
Said, "Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?"
[Verse 2]
Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
And I traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song
[Chorus]
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
[Verse 3]
The trumpeter's obviously been drinking
'Cause he's fucking up even the simplest lines
You say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the street, I'll be the only shit that's left behind[Chorus]
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
