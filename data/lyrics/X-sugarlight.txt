[Verse 1]
Sugarlight, we're addicts
Why do you think we came?
He's pasting gold leeches on my arm
[Verse 2]
We sharpen up our teeth
White sugar, he speaks French
Memorizing torsos
He's open-throated
[Verse 3]
In the corner
Hands arrive at hands
My arm is tied off, waiting
To burn it down
[Chorus]
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
