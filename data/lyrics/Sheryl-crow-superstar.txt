[Verse 1]
Let's all go downtown
I got friends doing nothing but hanging around
Well, I feel like there's something I could be missing
You know you look alright
You got cheap shoes, a Malibu, and big public fights
Well, there's no one else I would rather be kissin'
[Pre Chorus]
And baby, when you start to bleed, you look so sweet
Everybody's watching you, 'cause everybody wants to be
[Chorus 1]
Little superstar
Yeah, baby, that's what you are
Little superstar
Oh honey, that's what you are
[Verse 2]
I got a backstage line
I call you up, been watching you for quite some time
Well, I beat around the streets like Bandini looking for Camilla
Well, I'll be satin and speed
And you and I are still alive, we'll get off these streets
Well, there was a time I would've hung around just to be seen
[Pre Chorus]
Hey man, it's a shame when you start to fade
Diamond rings and sparkly things won't make your shine stay
[Chorus 2]
My little superstar
Oh baby, that's what you are
My little superstar
Oh honey, you break my heart
My little superstar
Oh honey, you know you are
My little superstar
Oh honey, you break my heart, yeah[Bridge]
Oh, hey man, well, it's a shame when you fade away
Diamond rings and sparkly things won't make your shine stay
Oh, won't make your life blaze
[Chorus 2]
My little superstar
Baby, that's what you are
My little superstar (Superstar)
Oh honey, you break my heart
My little superstar
Baby, that's what you are
My little superstar (Superstar)
Oh honey, you break my heart
Oh, my little superstar
Oh honey, you break my heart
My little superstar (Superstar)
Oh honey, you break my heart
Oh, my little superstar (Superstar)
[Outro]
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do (Superstar)
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do
