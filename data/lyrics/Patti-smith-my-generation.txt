[Chorus 1: Patti Smith]
People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we g-g-g-get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I don't need their fucking shit (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die because of it (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
[Chorus 2: John Cale]
Why don't you all fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation, baby
My generation, baby

Bababababababababa
[Chorus 1: Patti Smith]
My generation, baby
My generation, baby
I'm not trying to cause a b-big s-s-sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation, baby
My generation, baby
Oh, so young
I'm so goddamn young
I'm so young
I'm so goddamn young
Oh, so young
I'm so goddamn young
We created it, let's take it over
