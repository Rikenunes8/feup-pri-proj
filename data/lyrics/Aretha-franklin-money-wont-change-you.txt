[Verse 1]
Told me, darling, you had to go
Find somebody, I don't care no more, baby
Although you're happy, you better try to get along
(Get along without me)
[Chorus]
Money won't change you
I said money won't change you (Hey, hey)
No, money won't change you
But time is taking you on (Uh-huh)
Yeah (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
There have been times that I've been hurt (Hurt)
I sure know what it is to be treated just like dirt
Hold me, baby, and tell the world
Tell them I'm your sweetie, I'm your only girl
[Chorus]
Money won't change you (No, no)
I said money won't change you
But time is taking you on (Time)
Yes, it is (Time)
Oh
[Bridge]
I believe you're happy now that you're gone
(Get along without me)
But money won't change you
I say money won't change you (No)
Oh, money won't change you, no no
(Can you do without me?)
Money won't change you (Hey, hey)
I tell you money won't change you
But time will take you on (Time)
[Outro]
Oh, people, I feel good (Round two)
I told myself that I knew that I would
Oh, oh, money
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
(Get it, get it, get it) Get down
(Money won't change you)
Get it, get it, get it, get down with it
(Get it, get it, get it, money won't change you, oh no)
Get it, get it, get it, get down with it
Get it, get it, get down with it, baby
(Get it, get it, get it, money won't change you, oh no)
Get it, get it, get it, get down with it
Get it, get it, get it, get down, baby
