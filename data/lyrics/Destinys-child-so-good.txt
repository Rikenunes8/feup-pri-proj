[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Hey, how ya doin'?
Yeah, I'm doin' mighty fine
Last time I seen ya
It's been a long time
Stop smilin' at me, get that look off your face
Please don't even front, stop bein' so fake
I know you do not like me and you made it very clear
You're always talkin' about me
From what I hear
Always puttin' me down when you thought that you could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good
[Pre-Chorus: Kelly, 
with
 Destiny's
 Child
]
Wasn't it you that said
I thought I was all that and you said I didn't have a clue?
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through?
And wasn't it you that said
That I didn't look too good, 
that I wouldn't do too good?
I'd never make it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good
[Chorus: Destiny's Child, 
Beyoncé
]
So hood, so good, so good
I know you hate it, but I'm
So hood, so good, so good
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so good
So hood, so good, so good
It's hard to face it, but I'm
So hood, so good, so good
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
This is for them haters that said we wouldn't make it
Now we're doin' platinum
And now you can't take it
For all the people 'round us that have been negative
Look at us now
And see how we live
I stayed down wit' my people, all the ones that keep it real
Didn't get caught up
And how'd it make you feel?
All the things I'm doin' that you thought I never could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good[Pre-Chorus: Kelly, 
with Destiny's Child
]
Wasn't it you that said
I thought I was all that and you said I didn't have a clue?
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through?
And wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't do too good?
Look at me, now ain't God good
Now I made it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good
[Chorus: Destiny's Child, 
Beyoncé
]
So hood, so good, so good
I know you hate it, but I'm
So hood, so good, so good
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so good
So hood, so good, so good
It's hard to face it, but I'm
So hood, so good, so good
(So good)
[Break: Beyoncé]
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
Good, good, good, good, good, good
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
Good, good, good, good, good, good[Chorus: Destiny's Child, 
Beyoncé
]
So hood, so good, so good
I know you hate it, but I'm
So hood, so good, so good
So good
So hood, so good, so good
I am so, so good
So hood, so good, so good
Baby face it, I'm doin' good
So hood, so good, so good
Hey hey-yeah, doin' good, good, good
So hood, so good, so good
Doin' good, good, good, good
So hood, so good, so good
