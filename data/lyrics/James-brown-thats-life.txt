Hey, uh, one more for the road, uh
Give me the groove
That's life, that's what the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top in June
Said that's life, uh, funny as it may seem
Funky as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
From steppin' on a dream
But I don't let it get me down
'Cause this ol' world keeps spinning around, uh
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, uh
A poet, a pawn and a king
Been up, down and over and out
But I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get right back in the race
That's life, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting one time
The rent man wouldn't buy it, huh
And if I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die, hey
I've been a puppet, a pauper, pirate
A pawn and a king
Up and down, over and out
But I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
Said that's life, I can't deny it
Thought of running out
But my bills just wouldn't let me buy it
If I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball
Said I'd roll up, huh, roll right up
I'd get my razor, go down to the neighborhood bar
Can you think, I'd walk up to the bartender
And I ask for a little drink
Go over in the corner, I'd feel so bad
I'd wanna be a loner
Try, try to hide
Turn my back, reach and get my slide
Then I'd, then I'd cut somebody else, hahaha
