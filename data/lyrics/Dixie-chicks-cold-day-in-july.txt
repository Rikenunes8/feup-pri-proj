[Verse 1]
The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July
[Chorus]
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
[Verse 2]
You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July
[Chorus]
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
[Verse 3]
The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that
You would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July
[Outro]
Oh
Yeah
Oh yeah
La da da la da da la da da
Oh Ooo
