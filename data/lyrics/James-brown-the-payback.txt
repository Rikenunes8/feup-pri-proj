[Intro]
Hey!
Got to, got to payback
(The big payback)
Revenge, 
I'm mad
(The big payback)
Got to get back, I need some get-back
Payback, payback
(The big payback)
That's it, payback, revenge
I'm mad!
[Verse 1]
You get down with my girlfriend, that ain't right
You hollering and cussing, you want to fight
Payback is a thing you gotta see
Hell, brother, do any damn thing to me
You sold me out for chicken change
(Yes you did)
You told me that they, they had it all arranged
You had me down, and that's a fact
And now you punk, you gotta get ready
For the big payback
(The big payback)
That's where I land, on the big payback
(The big payback)
[Verse 2]
I can do wheeling, I can do dealing
(Yes we can)
But I don't do no damn squealing
I can dig rapping
I'm ready, I can dig scrapping
But I can't dig that backstabbing
(Oh no)
Now brother get ready, that's a fact
Get ready you mother for the big payback
(The big payback)
Let me hit them, hit them, 
Fred hit them[Verse 3]
You took my money, you got my honey
Don't want me to see what you doing to me
I can get back, I got to deal with you
Got to deal with you
Got to deal with you
I got to deal with you
Hey, let me tell you!
Get down with my woman, that ain't right
You holler and cuss, you wanna fight
Look here
Don't do me no done favor
I don't know karate, but I know ka-razor
(Yes we do)
Hey get ready, that's a fact, girl
Get ready you mother for the big payback
(The big payback)
Hey, I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a son of a man, but don't they tell you that pappa can
Get ready for the big payback
(The big payback)
Hit me again
Lord, lord, hey
Get ready
I need it, I need a hit again
The same one, the same one, same one
Hit me back, lord
(The big payback)[Verse 4]
Sold me out for 
chicken change
Said my woman had it all arranged
Tried to make a deal, but she wanted to squeal
But I had my boys on her heels
Saw me coming, told a lie
She broke down and she wanted to cry
I don't care what she does
Won't be doing just like she was
Take those kids and raise them up
Show 'em how to drink out the righteous cup
Take her, take that woman, it's one place she found
Just run that mother out of town
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
I'm mad, I want revenge, I want revenge, my
(The big payback)
My patience ends, I want revenge
My patience ends, I want revenge
I want revenge, I want revenge
(The big payback)
Gonna get some hits, I need those hits
I need those hits, hit me!
[Outro]
Lord, I need those hits
Carry on, carry on, payback melody
Alright
