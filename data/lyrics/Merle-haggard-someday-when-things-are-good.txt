[Verse]
Someday when things are good, I'm gonna leave you
I can't seem to go when things are bad
I'll be one more love that you can dream about
And one more man that you can say you've had
[Verse]
You'll always be the kind to dream of yesterday
And a way of life I never understood
And someday soon, I'll be just one more memory
And you'll call my name when things are not so good
[Verse]
Someday when things are good, I'm gonna leave you
I can't seem to go when things are bad
I'll be one more love that you can dream about
And one more man that you can say you've had
