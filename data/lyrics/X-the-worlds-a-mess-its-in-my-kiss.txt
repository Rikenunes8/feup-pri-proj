[Verse 1]
No one is united
And all things are untied
Perhaps we're boiling over inside
They've been telling lies
Who's been telling lies?
There are no angels
There are devils in many ways
Take it like a man
[Chorus]
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
[Verse 2]
You can't take it back
Pull it out of the fire
Pull it out in the bottom of the ninth
Pull it out in chords of red disease
Drag on the system
Drag on my head and body
Some facts here (Some facts here)
Which refuse to escape
I could say it stronger
But it's too much trouble
I was wandering down at the bricks
Hectic, isn't it?
Down we go, cradle and all
[Verse 3]
No one is united
And all things are untied
Perhaps we're boiling over inside
They've been telling lies
Who's been telling lies?
There are no angels
There are devils in many ways
Take it like a man
[Chorus]
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Go to hell, see if you like it, then come home with me)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Tomorrow night may be too late)
(Both moons are full like a lovely wife)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Dirty night dying like a lovely wife)
(Goodbye, my darling)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(How high the moon? Well, I wish I was)
(The world is fine, goodbye, my darling)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Both moons are full like a lovely wife)
(Dirty night dying like a lovely wife)
(Goodbye, my darling)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss[Organ Solo]
[Chorus]
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
