[Verse]
Your strange love was what I found
The day the rains came down
I remember we found shelter in the cave
With the rain clouds up above
In the darkness, we found love
The day the rains came, I became your slave
As the rains made rivers swell
I fell deeper in your spell
You took my hand and handed me a crown
But if I could just live on
With these things I have known
I know that I'll be glad of what I've found
As the rains made rivers swell
I fell deeper in your spell
You took my hand and handed me a crown
But if I could just live on
With these things I have known
I know that I'll be glad of what I've found
Your strange love was what I found
The day the rains came down
