It's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud
"I am lonely"

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
Remember what we've said and done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard


Tearing yourself away from me now--you are free
And I am crying
This does not mean I don't love you--I do, that's forever
Yes and for always

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key to your heart
And I love you
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?

Can I tell it like it is? (help me, I'm suffering)
Listen to me, baby
It's my heart that's suffering, it's a-dying (help me, I'm suffering)
And that's what I have to lose

I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?


Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing a song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow

Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she's so free
How can you catch the sparrow?

Lacy, lilting, lyric
Losing love, lamenting
Change my life, make it right
Be my lady

La reina de la Mar Caribe

Quiero sólo visitarla allí
