[Verse]
Hey, J
It's been a long time since I've seen you last
A half and twenty-six years
 (My, time is fast)
I'm well
Though I've gone through some deep changes in my life
It hasn't been easy
Oh, no, not for me
It's been difficult at times
Sometimes, I sit down and cry
And ask God, "Oh, why?"
(Fair, what is?)
[Pre-Chorus]
I know how you're feelin'
Same thing I did deal with
You're not as alone as you may feel
You see, but, oh
It catches up to us fast
We have to deal with the past
I know it's painful, but
There, you'll find specialness
'Cause everybody needs to feel real special
[Chorus]
We need to remember
That love lies deep within ourselves
We have to want it so
It starts with us and no one else
We must learn we're all born
With specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special, too
[Interlude]
(You see, you can't run away from your pain)
(Because, wherever you run, there you will be)
(You have to learn to water your spiritual garden)
(Then you will be free)[Pre-Chorus]
I know how you're feelin'
Same thing I did deal with
You're not as alone as you may feel
You see, but, oh
It catches up to us fast
We have to deal with the past
I know it's painful, but
There, you'll find specialness
'Cause everybody needs to feel real special
[Chorus]
We need to remember
That love lies deep within ourselves
We have to want it so
It starts with us and no one else
We must learn we're all born
With specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special, too
