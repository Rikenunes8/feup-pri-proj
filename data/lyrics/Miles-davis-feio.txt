What is the musical topic, of the day?
Bebop so the critic's say, well that was OK!
Who were the originators, do you know?
Yardbird and Dizzy tell me, I think its quite so
Now I'm just holding thumbs like, Toscaninni and La Cost
Well, as long as I'm hip to it, I think I'm hipper to the how
Explain it to the folks
Bebop my friends was just a whole lotta fun!
You could take any old riff, and make a real long run
