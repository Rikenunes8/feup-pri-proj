Something pushed me to the edge
That's where I've been
Some things get stuck in your head
That's in your head
Something pushed me to the edge
That's where I've been
Some things get stuck in your head
That's in your head, that's in your
Head, head
Head, head
Take what you want
Your mistakes made you wrong
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Take what you want
Your mistakes made you wrong
Keep your head up
Keep your head up

Somehow I've been shut down
Again and again
Somehow I've been shut down
Again and again
Oh
Ooh-woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Stop falling on your face
Of course everybody all makes mistakes
Watch me fall over the edge
It's not like it's gonna matter in the end
Like the things that you admit
The way it played out in your head
In your head, head
Head, head
Take what you want
Your mistakes made you wrong
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Take what you want
Your mistakes made you wrong
Keep your head up
Keep your head up

Somehow I've been shut down
Again and again
Somehow I've been shut down
Again and again
Oh
Ooh-woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Something pushed me to the edge
That's where I've been
Some things get stuck in your head
That's in your head, that's in your
Head, head
Head, head
