[Verse 1]
I want to hypnotize you, baby, on the telephone
So many times I called your house just to hear the tone
And though I knew that you weren't home
I didn't mind so much cause I'm so alone
I want to hypnotize you, baby, on the telephone
[Verse 2]
I want to spin my little watch right before your eyes
You're the kind of girl a guy like me could hypnotize
And if this comes as a surprise
Just think of all those guys that would tell you lies
I want to spin my little watch right before your eyes
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
I want to hold your little hand if I can be so bold
And be your right hand man 'til your hands get old
Then when all the feeling's gone
Just decide if you want to keep holding on
I want to hold your little hand if I can be so bold
[Outro]
If I can be so bold
If I can be so bold
