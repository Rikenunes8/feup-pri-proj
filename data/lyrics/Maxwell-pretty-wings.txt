Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they’ll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won’t remember me
Your face would be the reason I smile
But I will not see what cannot have forever
I’ll always love you
I hope you feel the same
Oh, oh, you played me dirty
Your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy
I had to set you free
Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you arе not with me
I had to leave, I had to lеave
I had to leave, I had to leave
If I can’t have you
Let love set you free to fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings
Pretty wings around
I came wrong, you were right
Transformed your love into a lie
Baby believe me, I’m sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times
I should have shown you better nights, better times, better days
And I miss you more and more
If I can’t have you
Let love set you free to fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings
Your pretty wings around
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Say pretty wings, pretty wings
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Darlin, Darlin, yeah
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty, Pretty, Pretty
Someone better is gonna love
Someone, someone gonna love you baby
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around (x4)
