[Verse 1]
I like where this is going
You like it too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to
[Chorus]
But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
[Verse 2]
Bet all that gold gets heavy
Weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary
Always tryin' not to get hurt
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the truth out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
[Bridge]
You don't know how to fly, no
That's okay, neither do I
[Chorus]
I know I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman
