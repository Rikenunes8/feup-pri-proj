Let's go away for a while, you and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
We won't need them where we're going
We're going where the wind is blowing
Not knowing where we're gonna stay

Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat

We will write a postcard to our
Friends and family in free verse
We will write a postcard to our
Friends and family in free verse
(On the road with Kerouac)
We will write a postcard to our
(Sheltered in his bivouac)
Friends and family in free verse
(On this road, we'll never die)

Heartbeat, heartbeat
Let's go away for a while
You and I, to a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holi—

Let's go away, let's go away
(—day, far away, to stay)
Let's go away, let's go away
(On a holiday, far away, to stay)
In a heartbeat
