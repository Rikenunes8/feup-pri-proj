[Verse 1]
Vicious
You hit me with a flower
You do it every hour
Oh, baby, you're so vicious
Vicious
You want me to hit you with a stick
But all I've got's a guitar pick
Heh, baby, you're so vicious
[Chorus]
When I watch you come, baby, I just wanna run, far away
You're not the kind of person 'round I wanna stay
When I see you walking down the street
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet
You're not the kind of person that I want to meet
Oh babe, you're so vicious
You're just so vicious
[Verse 2]
Vicious
Hey, you hit me with a flower
You do it every hour
Oh, baby, you're so vicious
Vicious
Hey, why don't you swallow razorblades?
You must think that I'm some kinda 
gay blade
But baby, you're so vicious
[Chorus]
When I see you coming, I just have to run
You're not good and you certainly aren't very much fun
When I see you walking down the street
I step on your hand and I mangle your feet
You're not the kind of person that I even want to meet
'Cause you're so vicious
Baby, you're so vicious
[Outro]
Vicious
Vicious
Vicious
Vicious
Vicious
Vicious
Vicious
