[Verse 1]
Well, last night I came home and I knocked on my door
And I called to my love as I oft' had before
And I knocked and I knocked; no answer there came
No kisses to greet me, no voice called my name
[Chorus]
And I couldn't believe it was true, oh Lord
Couldn't believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears and I must've aged ten years
And I couldn't believe it was true
[Verse 2]
Well, the shock was so great I am quivering yet
And I'll try to forgive but I cannot forget
My heart breaking loss is another man's gain
Her happiness, always, I hope will remain
[Chorus]
And I couldn't believe it was true, oh Lord
Couldn't believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears and I must've aged ten years
And I couldn't believe it was true
