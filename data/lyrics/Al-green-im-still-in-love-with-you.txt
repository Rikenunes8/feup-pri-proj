[Verse 1]
Spending my day, thinking 'bout you, girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do (Like I do)
Though it hurt me so to let you know
That I look in your eyes
To let me know how you feel
Let me know that love is really real
Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love
[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you, yeah, hey
Heaven knows that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you, hey
[Verse 2]
Hey, when I look in your eyes
And all, all the years I see (I see)
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love
[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you
Hey, ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ha
Ah-ha
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you[Outro]
Hey, I'll try it if you want me to
(Still in love, in love with you)
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ha
Ah-ha
