[Verse 1]
I was recently rid of a man again
So I caught me a cab to see Flanagan
I told the cabbie "the alley in back"
I told myself coming would keep me intact
Flanny shouts from the second floor
As I crossed the lot to the kitchen door
I see Guillermo and give him some lip
And I cross to the bar, Ellen pours me a nip
And I look to the stage it's the rock of rage as Jon is on
And how could I listen without wanting to be with them
And how could I have thought that I was ever alone?
[Chorus]
I feel like singing and drinking and stuff
And I don't wanna care if I stumble or cry
Handle me like family and that'll be enough
To keep me from dying when I want to die
[Post-Chorus]
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo
[Verse 2]
I'm hopping scotches with Loretta and Bob
But barely containing my rapturous song
Jon's calling names here like Santa's reindeer
On Palmer on Leisz on Sarah on Sean
I love watching the Watkins when they're rocking with Garza
I want to be part of the band though
And when Mr. Tench is on the bench
I want to be the piano
[Chorus]
I feel like singing and drinking and stuff
And I don't wanna care if I stumble or cry
Handle me like family and that'll be enough
To keep me from dying when I want to die[Post-Chorus]
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo
