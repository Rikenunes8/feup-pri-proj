[Verse 1: 3D]
A flask I drink of sober tea
While relay cameras monitor me
And the buzz surrounds, it does
Buzz surrounds, buzz surrounds
[Pre-Chorus: 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
Closed eyed sky wide open
Unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
Elsewhere, indefinite, far away
Magnifies and deepens
[Chorus: 3D & 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
And listening
Keeps me from my hurt
My ears know that my eyes are closed
Perished thoughts like contraband
[Verse 2: 3D]
I train myself in martial arts
As advertised
I reinforce my softened parts
As advertised
[Pre-Chorus: 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
See through me, little glazed lane
A world in myself
[Chorus 2: 3D & 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
Flickering, I roam
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed
[Chorus: 3D & 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
Flickering, I roam
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed[Verse 3: 3D]
I see to bolts
Put key to locks
No boats or rocks
I'm free to roam
On dummy screens
And magazines
[Refrain: 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
Closed eyed sky wide open
Unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
[Verse 4: 3D]
Think that I lay next to you
Wasting time when I could do
A simple job in strip lights
A flask I drink of sober tea
â€˜Til daylight sends me home
Flickering, I roam
[Outro: 
Elizabeth Fraser
]
Daydreaming, admiring, being
Quietly, open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight
See through me, little glazed lane
A world in myself
Daydreaming, admiring, being
Quietly, open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight
