The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've got the way
We'll lead the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong
The way, we know the way
We've got the way, we'll share the way
To bring you back home
To the peace where you belong
So many lost highways used to lead home
But now they seem used up and gone
They sure had the magic when they were first found
But not this road, this road has never been closed
It's still brand new

The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To bring you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've got the way
We'll lead the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, we know the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong

When faceless and anonymous
Come to beat down your door
And say you're all washed up and done
You can just say they have nothing
In store to touch this soul
Because they just don't know
They just don't know the way
The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
The way, we got the way
We know the way, we'll lead the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've found the way
We'll share the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong

The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
