[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
[Chorus]
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
And fall off the table
Get swept under
[Post-Chorus]
Denial, denial
[Verse 2]
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'
[Chorus]
And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
[Post-Chorus]
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
[Outro]
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)
