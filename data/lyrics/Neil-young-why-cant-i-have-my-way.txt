When the dream came, I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on, if I do come back at all
But you know me and I miss you now

In a strange game, I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side was just the same, you can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

Though we rush ahead to save our time, we are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you?
