[Verse 1]
There's something about you, baby
It happens all the time
Whenever I'm around you, baby
I get a dirty mind
It doesn't matter where we are
Doesn't matter who's around
Doesn't matter, I just want to lay you down
[Verse 2]
In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
But you never go too far
I may not be your kind of man
I may not be your style
But honey, all I want to do
Is just love you for a little while
[Verse 3]
If you got the time
I'll give you some money
To buy a dirty mind
Don't misunderstand me
I never fool around
But honey, you got me on my knees
Won't you please let me lay you down?
[Chorus]
I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around
It happens to me everytime
You just got to let me lay you
Got to let me lay you, lay you
You just got to let me lay you
Got to let me lay you down
[Verse 4]
In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
Underneath the stars
I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around
I don't want to hurt you, baby
I only want to lay you down
