[Verse 1]
The times are tough now, just getting tougher
This old world is rough, it's just getting rougher
Cover me, come on baby, cover me
[Chorus 1]
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
[Verse 2]
Promise me baby you won't let them find us
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Cover me, shut the door and cover me
[Chorus 1]
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
[Chorus 2]
Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more
[Verse 3]
This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough; I don't want to see any more
Cover me, come on and cover me
[Chorus 1]
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
[Chorus 2]
Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more
[Chorus 1]
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me[Outro]
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
