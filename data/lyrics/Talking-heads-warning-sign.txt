[Verse 1]
Warning sign, warning sign
I hear it, but I pay it no mind
Hear my voice, hear my voice
It's saying something and it's not very nice
Pay attention, pay attention
I'm talking to you and I hope you're concentrating
I've got money now, I've got money now
Come on, baby, come on, baby
[Chorus]
Warning sign of things to come
It happened before, it will happen again
Hear my voice, move my hair
I move it around a lot, but I don't care what I remember
What I remember, what I remember (What is it?)
What I remember, what I remember, what I remember (What is it?)
[Verse 2]
Warning sign, warning sign
Look at my hair, I like the design
It's the truth, it's the truth
Your glassy eyes and your open mouth
Take it easy baby, take it easy
It's a natural thing and you have to relax
I've got money now, I've got money now
Come on, baby, come on, baby
[Chorus]
Warning sign, of things to come (turn me over, turn me over)
Love is here but I guess it's gone now (hurry up babe, hurry up)
Hear my voice, move my hair
I move it around a lot, but I don't care what I remember
Remember, what I remember, what I remember (What is it?)
What I remember, what I remember, what I remember (What is it?)
[Outro]
What I remember, what I remember, what I remember
Remember, what I remember, what I remember
Remember, what I remember, what I remember
Remember, what I remember, what I remember
