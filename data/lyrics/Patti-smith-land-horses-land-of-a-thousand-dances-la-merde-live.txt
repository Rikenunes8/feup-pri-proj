The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
He looked and he saw
A fountain of water
It was just the water fountain
First, it was just the water fountain
But then it kept spurting and erupting in sheets
And then, sort of a static sheen
Out of a glassy eye, static sheen
He looked again
And he saw love
He saw love
Out of a pinhole
And he went up to it
And stuck his finger in it
And when he stuck his finger in it
On the other side was something so sweet and pleasurable
He moved his finger around
And suddenly he felt
His finger disintegrating
He felt the tip of his finger disintegrating
It scared the shit out of him
So he removed his hand
And stood there
And he saw this guy standing there
Saying "Hey, hey kid
Come here
Come here"
And he felt all the aggression of his age
He felt all the senseless bloated aggression of his age
He felt
He felt all the material
The bloated material senselessness of his age
He saw, he saw sides of beef
Studded in the sun swinging carcasses of beef
He just stood there
He stood there in the rain
He stood there and the boy beckoned him
He beckoned him and he said "Come on, come on"
And Johnny, he just…
He just looked at him and said
"Alright motherfucker
Come on, come on
You want me?
Come on, come and get me man
Cause I'm waitin'
I'm ready for you
I'm ready!
I'm ready, and you can bring it on down
Bring it on down
Bring it on, come on
Bring me everything you got
Bring me everything you got
I'm waiting here
I'm waiting here!
You standing at the water cooler
You think you're so fucking...
You think... you think...
You want me?
You want to mess with me?
I don't care anymore!
Come on and get me
Come on and get me motherfucker
'Cause I'm ready, I'm ready!The boy looked at Johnny
Johnny wanted to run
Johnny wanted to run
Johnny wanted to move
But the movie kept moving as planned
The boy gripped Johnny, he pressed him against the locker
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared
Johnny started
Crashing his head against the locker
Crashing his head against the locker
Crashing his head against the locker
Started laughing hysterically
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining, silver studs with their nose in flames
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney?
Do you know how to twist?
Well, it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato
Do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister
Got to lose control
Got to lose control
Then you take control
Then you take control
And you do the watusi, do the watusiLife is filled with holes
Johnny's just laying there in his sperm coffin
Angel comes up to him and says, “Oh, pretty boy
Can't you show me no-no-nothing but surrender?”
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket
Taped to his chest there's the answer
He got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow
And go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud
And go, Johnny, go!
And do the watusi, oh do the watusi
There's a little place, across the tracks
And the name of the place is
You like it like that, like it like that
Like it like that, like it like that
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Baby calm down, better calm down
Johnny
Ah, man!
So fucking high
Johnny
Johnny slid
Slid like some sorry eel
Through the debris of his world
All rugged tunnel children
Ah, he saw them
Crawling through the sewers
All children like him
Nothing to dream of
All the mothers and fathers
Out
They are working
They are working
To pay for the credit cards
To pay for the cellphones
And the Blackberries and their
All of their business communication systems
While they don't communicate with their kids at all
No communication at all
Johnny
Looking at the debris of his world
Material things everywhere, littered
People discarded
Fax machines and old computers and refrigerators
And left-over machine guns and tanks
And the debris of war
And science
And old syringes
And there was debris everywhere
And Johnny said
"I don't want it no more!
I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna walk bare handed
Out in the sea
I'm gonna walk bare handed
Into the sea
Into the sea
Into the sea of possibilities
I'm gonna
I'm gonna go walking"Johnny
Clean
Stretched out his arms
Into the sun
The air was [?]
The water clean
The water clean
Bright, shimmering
Johnny
Felt all of nature
Weeping at his feet
Reptiles and birds
Like the elusive dodo extinct
Moths and butterflies
Songbirds extinct
Wild, wild, wild deer and boar
And wolves extinct
Johnny walked out into the debris of his world
And he saw on the ground
A ticket
A ticket
Looked like a party invitation
Johnny decides to check it out
He goes through the streets of [?]
[?]
Down Portobello Road
He
He's walking in there
He finds a green door and opens
Goes into this here party
Well, Johnny goes into this party
But mmm, there's nothing happening at all
Nothing happening at all
Johnny goes into the party
And there's nothing happening at all
Until he looks out the window
Sees a sweet young thing
Humping on the parking meter
Leaning on the parking meter
Humping on the parking meter
Leaning on the parking meter
Humping on the parking meter
Leaning on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good
Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling
That I'm going to ah, ah
Make her mine
And I said darling
Tell me your name
Tell me your name
He whispered to me
He told me your name
He looked at me
Told me your name
Hey Johnny!
Come here, baby
Come on, Johnny
Come take me Johnny
And he said, oh baby
Come here
Come here
Come here
Come here
Tell me your name
Tell me your name
She whispered to him
Told me her name
She told me her name
She told me her name
She told me her name
She told me her name
And her name is, and her name is
And her name is, and her name is
