[Verse]
I'm going off of the deep end
And I'm slowly losing my mind
I disagree with the way (ha-ha) I'm living
But I can't hold myself in line
[Verse]
You give me no reason for my drinking
But I can't stand myself at times
And you're better off to just leave and forget me
'Cause I can't hold myself in line
[Verse]
Hey, my weakness is stronger than I am
Guess I've always been the losing kind
Now I'm full speed ahead down the wrong road of life
And I can't hold myself in line
[Verse]
Yeah, and I'm going off of the deep end
Hey, I'm slowly losing my mind
And I disagree with the way I've been living
But I can't hold myself in line
