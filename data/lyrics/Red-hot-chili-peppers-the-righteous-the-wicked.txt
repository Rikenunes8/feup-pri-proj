One, two, three, four

I can't rest in war, will you be my friend?
Dark Ages never change, well I can't comprehend
Kiss me, we self destruct, can you hear me, Lord?
Yes, I think we're fucked, but I can't rest in war

Righteous and the wicked of the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P, Prodigies of Peace
P.O.P, Prodigies of Peace
Hear me when I'm callin' you from my knees
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am praying for a better day, oh, yeah
Praying for a better day anyway, oh, yeah
Ahn, praying for a better day, oh, yeah
Holy mother earth crying into space
Tears on her pretty face for she has been raped
Killing your future blood, fill her with disease
Global abortion, please, that is what she needs

Righteous and the wicked of the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P, Prodigies of Peace
P.O.P, Prodigies of Peace
Hear me when I'm callin' you from my knees
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am praying for a better day, oh yeah
Praying for a better day anyway


Are we fireflies flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish, did you get it right?
Headstrong battle song, exploding souls be gone
Marvin Gaye, my love, where did we go wrong?
Righteous and the wicked of the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P, Prodigies of Peace, P.O.P, Prodigies of Peace
Hear me when I'm callin' you from my knees
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am praying for a better day, yeah
