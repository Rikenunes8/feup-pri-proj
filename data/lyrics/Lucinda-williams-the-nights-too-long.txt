[Verse 1]
Sylvia was workin' as a waitress in Beaumont
She said "I'm movin' away
I'm gonna get what I want
I'm tired of these 
small town boys
They don't move fast enough
I'm gonna find me one who wears a leather jacket
And likes his livin' rough"
[Verse 2]
So she saved her tips and overtime
And bought an old rusty car
She sold most everything she had
To make a brand new start
She said, "I won't be needin' these
Silly dresses and nylon hose
'Cause when I get to where I'm goin'
I'm gonna buy me all new clothes"
[Chorus]
The night's too long
It just drags on and on
And then there's never enough
That's when the sun starts comin' up
Don't let go of her hand
You just might be the right man
She loves the night
She loves the night
She doesn't want the night
Don't want it to end
Don't want it to end
[Verse 3]
Well she works in an office now
And she guesses the pay's alright
She can buy a few new things to wear
And still go out at night
And as soon as she gets home from work
She wants to be out with the crowd
Where she can dance and toss her head back
And laugh out loud
[Verse 4]
Well, the music's playin' fast
And they just met
He presses up against her
And his shirt's all soaked with sweat
And with her back against the bar
She can listen to the band
And she's holdin' a Corona
And it's cold against her hand[Chorus]
The night's too long
It just drags on and on
And then there's never enough
That's when the sun starts comin' up
Don't let go of her hand
You just might be the right man
She loves the night
She loves the night
She doesn't want the night
Don't want it to end
Don't want it to end
Don't want it to end
