[Verse 1]
I foresee a time without me
So not unlike the trees
I've stood for so long
So long
[Pre-Chorus]
Shading life inside the falling rain
All alone, in love with age and someone
Someone else
[Chorus]
Sundays come and Sundays flee
Sundays wed
Won't you stand with me?
Not someone
Not someone else
[Verse 2]
My seedlings grow, and grow
And home is whatever ground they hold
Shading life inside the falling rain
All alone, in love with age and someone
Someone else
But I've grown stronger
As someone, as someone
As someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
Shading life inside the falling rain
All alone, in love with age and someone
Someone else
[Chorus]
Sundays come and Sundays flee
Sundays wed
Won't you stand with me?
Not someone
Not someone else[Bridge]
As my seedlings grow, and grow
Towards someone
Towards someone else
[Outro]
The birch grove stands for us
