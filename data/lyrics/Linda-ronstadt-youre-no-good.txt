[Verse 1]
Feeling better now that we're through
Feeling better 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson,
 it left a scar
Now I see how you really are
[Chorus]
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
[Verse 2]
I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me
[Chorus]
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
I'm turning you down, baby, and I'm going my way
Forget about you baby 'cause I'm leaving to stay
[Chorus]
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good[Outro]
Oh, oh no
You're no good, 
you're no good
, 
you're no good
Baby, you're no good
