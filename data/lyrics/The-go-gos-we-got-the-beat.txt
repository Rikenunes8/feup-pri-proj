[Verse 1]
See the people walking down the street
Fall in line just watching all their feet
They don't know where they wanna go
But they're walking in time
[Chorus]
They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat, yeah
They got the beat
[Verse 2]
See the kids just getting out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line
[Chorus]
They got the beat
They got the beat
Kids got the beat, yeah
Kids got the beat
[Verse 3]
Go-go music really makes us dance
Do the pony puts us in a trance
Do the watusi just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line
[Chorus]
'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat, yeah
We got it
[Outro]
We got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Everybody get on your feet
We got the beat
We know you can dance to the beat
We got the beat
Jumpin', get down
We got the beat
Round and round and round
We got the beat
We got the beat...
