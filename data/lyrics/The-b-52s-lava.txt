My body's burning like a lava from a Mauna Loa
My heart is breaking like a Krakatoa
Oh, Krakatoa, east of Java, molten bodies, fiery lava
Fire, fire, burning bright
Turn on your love lava
Turn on your lava light
Fire, oh volcano, over you
Don't let your lava love turn to stone
Keep it burning
Keep it burning here at home
Hot Lava
Hot Lava
My love may be as high as the highest volcano
But the altitude is way too high
Well, it gets so cold when you look at me that way, yeah
I just wanna have that hot lava
Loving me away
My love's mountin'
My love's erupting like a red hot volcano
Fire, oh volcano, over you
I gotta lotta lava love locked up inside me
My love's a lava bomb
Knock you in the head
Knock you in the head
Kick you in the bed
(Over you)
Hot lava
Don't let your lava love turn to stone
Keep in burning
Keep it burning here at home
Oh it's so hot
Oh, it's burnin' up in here
Oh look out, it's about to erupt
Oh, my body's burning like a lava from a Mauna Loa
Let it flow!
My heart is breaking like a KrakatoaHot fire, red hot fire
Lava, oh oh oh oh oh, hot lava
Hot lava, red hot lava
Hot lava, red, hot lava
Oh hot lava
I'm gonna let it go
Let it flow like Pompeii or Herculaneum
Let it sizzle, let it rise
Don't let your lava love flow turn to stone
Keep it burning
Keep it burning here at home
I'm gonna jump in a crater
See ya later
Oh hot lava
Oh hot lava
