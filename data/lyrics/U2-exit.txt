You know he got the cure
You know he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love
His head it felt heavy
As he cut across the land
A dog started cryin'
Like a broken-hearted man
At the howling wind
At the howling wind
He went deeper into black
Deeper into white
He could see the stars shine
Like nails in the night
He felt the healing
Healing, healing, healing hands of love
Like the stars shiny, shiny from above
A hand in the pocket
Finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
And his heart he could feel was beating
Beating, beating, beating
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love
My love
So hands that build
Can also pull down
The hands of love
