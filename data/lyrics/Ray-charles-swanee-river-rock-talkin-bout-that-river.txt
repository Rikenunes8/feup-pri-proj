[Verse]
Do you know way down (Way down)
Way down upon the Swanee (Swanee)
Talkin' 'bout the river (River)
You know was so far (So far)
So far away (So far away) (Oh, yeah)
Do you know that's where (That's where)
Where my heart is turnin', ohh (Turnin')
Ever
And there's where (There's where)
There's where the old folks stay (Where the old folks stay)
[Chorus][x2]
All the world is sad
And lonely now
Everywhere I roam
Keep until you're mine darlin' (Darlin')
How my heart is going sad (So sad)
So sad and lonely
Because I'm so far (So far)
I'm far from my folks back home (From my folks back home)
[Outro]
So far from my folks back home, yeah
I'm far from my folks back home, yeah
So far from my folks back home, yeah
Oh, far from my folks back home, yeah
