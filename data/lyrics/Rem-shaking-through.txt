[Verse 1]
Could it be that one small voice
Doesn't count in the room
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denying all the way
Could this by three be ten
Honor marches on
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denial all the way
[Chorus]
Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune
[Verse 2]
Are we grown way too far
Taking after rain
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denying all the way
[Chorus]
Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune
[Bridge]
In my life
[Verse 3]
Ears that are still
Children of today on parade
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denying all the way
[Chorus]
Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune[Outro]
Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune
