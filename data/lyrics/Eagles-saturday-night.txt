[Intro]
Ya
One, two, three
Two, two, three
[Verse 1]
Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing
[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
[Verse 2]
The years brought the railroad it ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave?
Go around with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance
[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Choosing a friend and losing a fight?
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
