Hush a wild violet
Hush a band of gold
Hush you're in a story
I heard somebody told
Tear the promise from my heart
Tear my heart today
You have found another
Baby, I must go away
Hang down your head for sorrow
Hang down your head for me
Hang down your head tomorrow
Hang down your head, Marie
Hush my love the rain now
Hush my love was so true
Hush my love a train now
But it takes me away from you
Hang down your head for sorrow
Hang down your head for me
Hang down your head, hang down your head
Hang down your head, Marie
