[Verse 1]
I don't believe in first impressions
For just this once I hope
That looks don't deceive
I ain't got time for true confessions
[Pre-Chorus]
Got to make the move right now
Got to meet that girl somehow
[Chorus]
Get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna make the first time last
[Verse 2]
I'm not much good at conversation
I never was much good
At coming on real strong
But if all it takes is inspiration
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I might have just what it takes
If I don't make no bad mistakes
And I
[Chorus]
Get it right the first time
'Cause that's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time last
[Bridge]
I might find the courage
Yeah, I might get up the nerve
But if my timing ain't just right
What purpose would that serve?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How to say those first few words
If I want to put myself in touch
The first few moments mean so much[Verse 3]
So I suppose it's now or never
Before that woman
Walks right out of my life
Just let me pull myself together
[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to give it one good try
Gotta take my chance tonight
[Outro]
Get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time last
