Yeah, yo, son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man

Yo, I got a new, yoo— niggas don't even know, son
Yo, check the joint, boom
Yo, I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this is how you freak 'em, boom
You go get— You go get the cream joints, right? Boom
Now, now, all you— all you dye is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream
You know what I'm saying? (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son, word is bond, I'ma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying? (
Yeah
)
Yo, son, I had crazy visions
Check it out, check it out, check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, woo— check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right?
A navy blue— A navy blue pair, right? Boom
Of this— Of this shit, know what I'm saying?
But dyed, get this dyed cream on top
Just imagine that color, like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake, like—
[Intro: Raekwon]
Know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Check it, yo, yo, yo, yo
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Po-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick-fast we reflect like the sky be blue, true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky, crash your fantasy
Gettin' high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collectin' Tecs and checks and
Flowin' slow in a Montero flexin'
Beats break heavily, word to 
INS
, bless me
Throw me like three bags of sess
For real, from the Killah Hill, locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, we actin' like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max sellin', enjoy the highs, what?
[Chorus: Raekwon and Ghostface Killah]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
, 
original man
Possess the power to hold G's, guns and grams
Baker, baker, pull off a 
Keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords bein' swung
Slicin' with a vocal from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, movin' motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken 
punches
 that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped
[Chorus: Raekwon and Ghostface Killah]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
, 
original man
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
, 
original man
Possess the power to hold G's, guns and grams
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Straight up and down, it's all good
Peace to them check-cashin', chain-snatchin', gun-flashin'
Niggas in the hoods bubblin' goods
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour, chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max
Swimmin' pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a cravin' for Cris
Until we get back, unpack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds, collect twenty thou' and then be out
Heavy convoys, my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid 
pat down Dan Aykroyd[Refrain: Ghostface Killah]
My seeds grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family
[Chorus: Raekwon and Ghostface Killah]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
, 
original man
Possess the power to hold G's, guns and grams
Baker, baker, pull off a 
Keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the house and watch me scrape her
[Refrain: Ghostface Killah]
My seeds grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

Been a long time since the Father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu-Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drank Cristal wine
It's been a long time, my people walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had a Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time, it's been a long time
It's been a long time
Yo, it's been a long time
What's on your mind?
Check it, respect heat holders
