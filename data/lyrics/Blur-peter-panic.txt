[Verse 1]
Hello, Peter Panic, you've landed on our planet
What a strange thing you are, with little pissy eyes
You got in the television, turned us all old and wizened
Then disappeared to a distant star and we remember you as
[Chorus]
Peter Panic, who lives forever
Peter Panic, as light as a feather
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar
Peter Panic, who lives forever
Peter Panic, as light as a feather
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar again
[Verse 2]
He left his secret with the chemist, who made it taste very pleasant
Now everyone has gone to his star, happy to be with
[Chorus]
Peter Panic, he lives forever
Peter Panic, as light as a feather
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar
Peter Panic, who lives forever
Peter Panic, as light as a feather
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar again
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
Peter Panic, he lives forever
Peter Panic, as light as a feather
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar
Peter Panic, who lives forever
Peter Panic, as light as a feather
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar again[Outro]
And he says it's okay when you blow him away
He'll be back for you some other day
When you're running out of sugar again
