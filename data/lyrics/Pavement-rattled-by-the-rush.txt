[Verse 1]
Oh, that I could bend my tongue outwards
Leave your lungs hurting,
 
tucking my shirt in
Pants I wear so well,
 
cross your t's shirt smell
Worse than your lyin
', 
caught my dad cryin
'
Loose like the wind
From the rough we get par
Sleet city woman
 
waiting to spar
[Chorus]
I'm drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
[Verse 2]
Getting off on the candelabra
We call her Barbara, breeding like larva
She rabble rousing, dental surf combat
Get out those hard-hats
And sing us some skat
Blade gushers gush
Chained and perfumed
I don't need a minister to call me a groom
[Chorus]
But I'm rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
[Break]
No soap in the john
No soap in the john
No soap in the john
No soap in the john
[Chorus]
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush
Rattled by the rush (makes you wanna say your prayers)
