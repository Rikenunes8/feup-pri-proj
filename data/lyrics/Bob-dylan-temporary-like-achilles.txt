[Verse 1]
Standing on your window, honey
Yes, I’ve been here before
Feeling so harmless
I’m looking at your second door
How come you don’t send me no regards?
[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin'
Honey, why are you so hard?
[Verse 2]
Kneeling ’neath your ceiling
Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while
I’m trying to read your poetry, but
I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, why you so hard?
[Bridge]
Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime?
Or is it just solid rock?
[Verse 3]
Well, I lean into your hallway
Lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?
[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, but you’re so hard[Verse 4]
Achilles is in your alleyway
He don’t want me here, he does brag
He’s pointing to the sky
And he’s hungry, 
like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin'
Honey, but you’re so hard
