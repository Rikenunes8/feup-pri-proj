[Verse 1]
A friend of mine, she cries at night
And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes
And she wants one of her own
She's waited long enough she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside
[Refrain]
She is scared
Scared to run out of time
[Verse 2]
I see my folks are getting on
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange
No matter how you tell yourself
It's what we all go through
Those lines are pretty hard to take
When they're staring back at you
[Refrain]
(Oh, oh, oh)
Scared you'll run out of time[Bridge]
When did the choices get so hard
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to waste
[Refrain]
Mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time
[Verse 3]
Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid
You came along and showed me
I could leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again
And then much to my surprise
[Chorus]
I found love, baby
Love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love darlin'
Love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love, baby
Love in the nick of time[Outro]
Ooooh
Yeah baby
Uhhh
Found love
In the nick of time
Thought I'd given up
Given up baby
Oh, baby, now
