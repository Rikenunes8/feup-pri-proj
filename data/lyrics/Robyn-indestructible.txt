[Verse 1]
I'm going backwards through time at the speed of light
I'm yours, you're mine
, two satellites
Not alone
No, we're not alone
A freeze-frame of your eye in the strobelight
Sweat dripping down from your brow, hold tight
Don't let go
Don't you let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go, but
[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible
[Verse 2]
Hands up in the air like we don't care
We're shooting deep into space
And the lasers split the dark
Cut right through the dark
It's just us, we ignore the crowd dancing
Four to the floor
Beats in my heart
Put your hands on my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go, but
[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
Ooh, and I'm gonna love you like...
I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before (Like I)
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible[Pre-Chorus]
And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go, but
[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
Ooh, and I'm gonna love you like...
I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before (Yeah)
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible
