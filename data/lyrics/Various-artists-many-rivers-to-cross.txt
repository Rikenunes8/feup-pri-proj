Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along White Cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride
Oh, that loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess I'll have to try

Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin? I'm playing for time
There'll be times I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along the White Cliffs of Dover...
