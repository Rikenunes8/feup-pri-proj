[Intro]
Let's stay together
[Verse 1]
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
[Verse 2]
Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
[Verse 3]
Why somebody, why people break up
Turn around and make up, I just can't see
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?
Just being around you is all I see, it's what I want to do
[Chorus]
Let's, we ought to stay together
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
[Outro]
C'mon, let's, let's stay together
I'll keep on lovin' you whether
Whether times are, oh times are good or times are bad
