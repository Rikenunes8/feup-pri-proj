Friends come and friends go
As I go round and round
In circles

Love warms and love colds
As I go round and round
In circles

He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles
Life comes and life goes
As we go round and round
In circles

He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
As I go round in circles

Life comes and love goes
As we go round and round
In circles
