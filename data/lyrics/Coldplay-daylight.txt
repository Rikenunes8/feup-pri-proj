[Verse 1]
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight
[Chorus]
Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Ooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without it
[Verse 2]
On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight
[Chorus]
Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Ooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without daylight
[Outro]
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
