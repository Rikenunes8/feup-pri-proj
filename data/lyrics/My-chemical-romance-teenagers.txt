[Verse 1]
They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine
[Chorus]
They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
[Verse 2]
The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did
[Chorus]
They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
All together now
[Chorus]
"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
