[Verse 1]
Just when it falls apart
And when it's time to start
Will you sit down here for 
another day
?
And when it's time to be
All the things that we
Are wishing away for another day
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause me and my soul we know where we're going
We're going where the grass is free
And the air is clean and the good times are growing
[Chorus 1]
So take me away
Just for today
'Cause I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be
Under the sea
But I probably need a phone
[Verse 2]
And just when it falls apart
Just when it's time to start
Will you sit down here for another day?[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause me and my soul we know where we're going
We're going where the grass is free
And the air is clean and the good times are growing
[Chorus 1]
So take me away
Just for today
'Cause I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be
Under the sea
But I probably need a phone
[Chorus 2]
I could be you
If I wanted to
But I've never got the time
You could be me
And pretty soon you will be
But you're gonna need a line
Need a line
Need a line
Need a line
