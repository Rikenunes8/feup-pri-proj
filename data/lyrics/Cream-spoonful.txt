Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me?
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Could fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man
Men lies
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies
Everything's a-fightin' about it
Everything's a-cryin' about it
Everything's a-diein' about it
Everything's a-cryin' about it
Everything's a-liein' about itLittle old, little old spoonful
Die'n about it
Cryin about it
That spoon, that spoon
Little old, little old spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Everything's a-diein' about it
