[Verse 1]
Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out, ringing in my ears
[Chorus]
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
[Verse 2]
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
