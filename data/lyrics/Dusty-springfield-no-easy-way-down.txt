Your toy balloon has sailed
In the sky, love
But now it must fall
To the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down
The view from the cliffs
Must have been exciting
And up to the peaks
You were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down
No it isn't very easy
When you're left on your own
No it isn't very easy
When each road you take
Is one more mistake
There's no-one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah
We all like to climb to the heights of love
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to descend
That there is no easy way down
You know you're gonna find
There is no easy way down
