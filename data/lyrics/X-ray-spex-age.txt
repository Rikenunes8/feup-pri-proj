Darling, am I looking old?
Tell me dear, I must be told
You know it's a 
million dollar fear
If lines creep in over here
Age - She's so afraid
Age - She's not the rage
Age - She's so afraid
Age - She's not the rage
Alienation is the thing
Tell me dear, do I look big?
Is my physique holding up?
Tell me darling, I feel apart
Age - She's so afraid
Age - She's not the rage
Age - She's so afraid
Age - She's not the rage
She never seems to realise
Celluloid beauty never dies
Shivering in sillhouette
Thirty-four, the minuette
Age - She's so afraid
Age - She's not the rage
Age - She's so afraid
Age - She's not the rage
Darling, am I looking old?
Tell me dear, I must be told
You know it's a million dollar fear
If lines creep in over here
