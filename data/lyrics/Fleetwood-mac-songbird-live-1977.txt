[Verse 1]
For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
‘Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right
[Verse 2]
For you, I'll give the world
For you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right
[Chorus]
And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before
[Bridge]
And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself
[Chorus 2]
And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like nеver before[Outro]
Likе never before
Like never before
(Thank you, thank you, goodnight)
We need it!
