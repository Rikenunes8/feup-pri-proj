[Verse 1]
O God
High in your fields above earth
Come and be real for us
You with your mind
Oh yes you are
Beautifully fine
[Verse 2]
O Girl
Electric witch you are
Limp in society's ditch you are
Visually fine
Oh yes you are
But mentally dying
[Verse 3]
O boy
Just like a boat you are
Sunk but somehow you float you do
Mentally weak
Oh yes you are
But so much you speak
