[Verse 1]
There's a long line of mourners
Driving down our little street
Their fancy cars
Are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends
Who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought you
Brought you home to me
[Verse 2]
When you left, you know you told me
That some day you'd be returning
In a fancy car
All the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you
You finally had your dream
Yeah, and you're riding
(You're riding)
In a long black limousine
[Bridge]
You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
Well, you're riding in that long black limousine
(You're riding in that long black limousine)
[Verse 3]
Through tear filled eyes I watch
As you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I'll never, I'll never love another
Oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you
In that long black limousine
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
