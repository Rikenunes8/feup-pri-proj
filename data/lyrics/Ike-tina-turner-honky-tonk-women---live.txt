I met a gin soaked, bar room queen in Memphis
He tried to take me upstairs for a ride
He had to heave me right across his shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
I'm the honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme a honky tonk man
I laid a V.I.P. in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
He blew my nose and then he blew my mind
I'm a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme a honky tonk man
(Yeah)
I'm a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme a honky tonk man
(Yeah)
I'm a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme a honky tonk man
