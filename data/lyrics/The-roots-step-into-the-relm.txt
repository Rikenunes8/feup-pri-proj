Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart

Yo, I walk across this world that's deceptive
Beats are perfected, the ghetto's infested
With more destruction, my vocal eruption
Was speaking 'bout corruption with no introduction
Approach me with caution cause I spark losses
M-Illatant the rap arson, marchin'
Leaving niggas stiff like I'm starchin', departin'
Hollywood Sambos are jokes just like Martin
I'm the type of nigga that belongs in a ward
With a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword
Self-proclaimed lames calling theyselves bold
They shall be floored when the claps applaud
If this the point of life when I canâ€™t afford
Then I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud
Now back to the topic of the rap philosopher
With more drama than a soap opera
Who stops the propaganda, the hot block commander
Putting a halt to all the backtalk and slander
Warn every challenger about the silencer
Muzzle in your mouth for the days that's on the calendar
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart

I'm from the valley of the heavy-heads, watch the ghetto pre-medical
Undergrads and steady red faces of stone
Eyes are crevices, life like a double negative
Philly criminal, I rhyme my dirt, Tariq already did
Building this Fifth foundation in the wilderness
Thoughtless, trespass and enter Thought's fortress
Limitless interest, paid to the order of the
Cypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless
Defenseless, niggas never moving me inches
The beat Fifth, invisible in the trenches
Aficionado, awesome hip-hop drug problem
Fuck stardom and chickens up in Gotham
Poltergeist, slit or choke the mic 'til it scream to me, "Stop that"
Cash we conveniently got that
I stroll through your scenery cocked back
Me and Hot Mack, the '98, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart
