[Verse 1]
I heard what you said and I can tell you it's true
I heard you've said that I am crazy about you
Turn in my sleep, the bad dream is over
Think of you and shall I ever recover?
[Chorus]
Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
[Verse 2]
I stood at the kitchen sink, my radio played
Songs like "Tainted Love" and "Love Is Strange"
As I listened and the words hit my ears
I cried sudden tears
[Chorus]
Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
[Post-Chorus]
Wake up
[Bridge]
It's mad
To be in love with someone else
When you're in love with he
She's in love with me
But you know as well as I do
I can never think of anyone but you
[Interlude]
All my life
All my life
I want to wake up
[Verse 3]
Play with fire, play with guns
It's easy to impress someone
Turning in my sleep you call me a fool
To fall in love is it so uncool?[Chorus]
Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Now I want to wake up
Wake up
[Interlude]
[Outro]
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up with you
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up with you, oh, oh
I want to wake up
Oh, I, I want to wake up with you, oh
I, I want to wake up with you, oh, oh
I want to wake up, wake up, wake up
I, I want to wake up, wake up, wake up with you
I want to wake up, oh, oh
Oh
