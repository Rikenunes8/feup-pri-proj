[Verse 1]
There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the countryside's a sin
And the price of life is too high to give up
Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through
[Pre-Chorus]
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
[Chorus]
Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
[Verse 2]
You don't have to get high to be happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
They won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the white house doors
And does what he says he'll do
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 2x]
