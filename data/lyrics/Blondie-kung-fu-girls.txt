[Intro]
[?]
[Verse 1]
Down in Chinatown, the year of the cock
He sold the silver belt, put it in hock
Fistful of money, mouth full of gold
Soon to be free of all armful of holes
[Chorus]
She was a Kung Fu girl, Kung Fu girl
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
He got the address symbolized in Cantonese
Then asked a native, "Some assistance, please"
She took him to the secret door, he was kissing the floor
Don't know much more
[Chorus]
She was a Kung Fu girl, Kung Fu girl
Heng lu Cindy Sue
Difo difong hacking hu
In a flash of recollection of oriental pride
She threw him to the side
[Verse 2]
Got the address, gave the door a knock
What happened next caused quite a shock
She was standing, looking out the door
He was kicked to the floor
Don't know much more
[Chorus]
She was a Kung Fu girl, Kung Fu girl
Oh, yeah
[Outro]
Kung Fu
Cindy Sue
Oh, I want to get close to you
You're my Kung Fu girl
You're my Kung Fu girl
Oh my oriental pearl
Kung Fu, Cindy Sue
Oh, I want to get close to you
You're my Kung Fu girl
You're my Kung Fu girl, get down
