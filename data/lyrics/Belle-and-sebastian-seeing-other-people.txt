[Verse 1]
We lay on the bed there, kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
'Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth, a hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be okay and we won't get in a muddle
We're seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing
[Verse 2]
So how are you feeling?
I don't think you can be dealing with the situation very well
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's okay
When it's over you are looking at the working week
Through the eyes of a gigolo
[Verse 3]
You're kissing your elbow, you're kissing your reflection
And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the
New, tall, elegant rich kids
You can bet it is a bitch, kid
But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that
You're going to have to change or you're going to have to go with girls
You'd be better off, at least they know where to put it
[Verse 1]
We lay on the bed there, kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
'Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth, a hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be okay and we won't get in a muddle
We're seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing
[Outro]
Seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing
Seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing
