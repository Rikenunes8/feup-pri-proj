[Chorus]
Well, I realize that I've been hypnotized
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
Alright!
[Verse 1]
Hey, Gypsy
Way up in my tree I'm sitting by my fire
Wondering where in this world might you be
And knowing all the time you're still roaming the countryside
Do you still think about me?
Oh my, gypsy
Well, I walked right on to your rebel roadside
The one that rambles on for a million miles
Yes, I walk down this road searching for your love and my soul too
But when I find you, I ain't gonna let go
I remember the first time I saw you
The tears in your eyes looked like they were trying to say
Oh, little boy, you know I could love you
But first, I must make my getaway
Two strange men fighting to the death over me today
I'll try to meet you by the old highway
Hey!
[Chorus]
Well, I realize that I've been hypnotized
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
Alright!
[Verse 2]
I've been searching so long, my feet, they painfully lose the battle
Down against the road my weary knees take their place
Off to the side I fall, but I hear a sweet call
My gypsy eyes has found me and I've been saved[Outro]
Lord, I've been saved
That's why I love you
Said, I love you
Hey, I love you
Lord, I love you
Hey!
