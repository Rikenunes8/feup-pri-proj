[Guitar Intro]
[Verse 1]
I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin', no
Because worrying's a waste of my time
Show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
[Bridge]
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before
[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line[Bridge]
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before
[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone, never
Oh, leave me alone
[Outro]
Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I shoulda known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I, I leave it all behind
