[Intro]
Yeah, that's right!
It's time, to set the record straight
[Verse One]
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear
[Chorus]
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
Time for livin', time for givin'
[Verse Two]
Check this out
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear
[Interlude]
Soul fire, soul fire
And we ain't got no water
We don't got no water
[Outro]
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sell
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sell
