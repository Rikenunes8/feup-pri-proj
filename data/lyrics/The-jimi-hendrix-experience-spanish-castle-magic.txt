[Verse 1]
It's very far away
It takes about a half a day to get there
If we travel by my, dragonfly
No it's not in Spain
But all the same you know, it's a groovy name
And the wind's just right
Hey!
[Chorus]
Hang on my darling
Hang on if you want to go
Hear it's a really groovy place
It's uh, just a little bit of uh, said uh
Spanish Castle Magic
[Verse 2]
The clouds are really low
And they overflow with cotton candy
And battlegrounds red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time on bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out! Ooh
[Chorus]
Hang on my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It's a ha, as you can see
A really groovy place
It's just a little bit of
Spanish Castle Magic
Yeah baby, listen
[Instrumental Break]
Yeah, It's all in your mind babe
Ow! Yeah
[Chorus]
Hang on my darling, hey
Hang on, hang on if you want to go
Oh girl, that's right baby
It's a, a little bit of
Spanish Castle Magic, hey
Little bit of
Spanish Castle Magic
Hey, I can't sing this song[Outro]
Yeah baby
Get on baby, yeah
It's all in your mind
Little bit of daydream here and there
Oh, yeah, oh, hey!
Everything's going to be alright
