[Intro]
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
[Verse 1]
I've been so high, I never wanted to come down
Drifting, drifting
I've been so lost, I never wanted to be found
I'm all hung over with bad dreams
I stumble in to messy scenes
[Chorus]
I'm coming down
I can't face the dawn
I'm coming down
I feel too far gone
[Verse 2]
I've been drifting
I've been strung out, I've been burned
Drifting, drifting
I've been lonely to the point of no return
I drank myself to sleep last night
I see the world through bloodshot eyes
[Chorus]
I'm coming down
I can't face the dawn
I'm coming down
I feel too far gone
[Refrain]
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting[Bridge]
Highs and pills won't heal my ills but
They make me feel better for a little while
[Chorus]
I'm coming down
I can't face the dawn
I'm coming down
I feel too far gone
[Post-Chorus]
I'm coming down
I'm coming down
I'm coming down
I'm coming down
[Outro]
Drifting, drifting
I'm coming down
I'm coming down
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting
Yeah, I know that feeling
