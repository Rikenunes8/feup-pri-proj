[Intro: Dan Brandenstein & NASA]
"
Columbia
 now 9 times the speed of sound
Roger that, Dan, I've got a solid TACAN locked on, uh, TACAN 23..."
"The, uh, tracking data, map data, and pre-planned trajectory are all one line on the block"
[Verse 1: Kate Bush]
Hello, Earth
"Hello, Earth"
Hello, Earth
"Hello, Earth"
With just one hand held up high
I can blot you out, out of sight
Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, little Earth
With just my heart and my mind, I can be driving, driving home
And you asleep on the seat
[Pre-Chorus 1: Kate Bush]
I'd get out of my car
Step into the night
And look up at the sky
And there's something bright
Traveling fast
[Chorus 1: Kate Bush]
Just look at it go
Just look at it go
[Interlude]
[Verse 2: Kate Bush]
Hello, Earth
Hello, Earth
Watching storms start to form
Over America
Can't do anything
Just watch them swing with the wind out to sea
[Verse 3: Kate Bush]
All you sailors
Get out of the waves, get out of the water!
All life-savers
Get out of the waves, get out of the water!
All you cruisers
Get out of the waves, get out of the water!
All you fishermen head for home
Go to sleep, little Earth[Pre-Chorus 2: Kate Bush]
I was there at the birth
Out of the cloudburst, the head of the tempest
Murderer!
Murderer of calm!
[Chorus 2: Kate Bush]
Why did I go?
Why did I go?
[Interlude]
[Outro: Kate Bush]
Tiefer, tiefer
Irgendwo in der Tiefe
Gibt es ein Licht
Go to sleep, little Earth...
