There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)
Babe, can you hear me now?
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)
The chains are locked and tied across my door
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)
Babe, sing with me somehow
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

Helpless, helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless)
Helpless, helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless, helpless)
Helpless, helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless, helpless)
Helpless, helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)
Helpless, helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)
Helpless, helpless
(Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless)
