[Verse 1]
You wanna know
If we fell in love too fast
You wanna know
If this is, well, too good to last
[Pre-Chorus]
You're asking the wrong questions
You're opening the wrong doors
[Chorus]
I love you, I can't touch you anymore
I can't touch you anymore
There's so much to hate you for
I love you, I can't touch you anymore
[Verse 2]
You want to tell me
Fifty ways you've left your lovers
You want to tell me
How you loved two hundred others
[Pre-Chorus]
You're asking the wrong questions
You're opening the wrong doors
[Chorus]
I love you, I can't touch you anymore
I can't touch you anymore
There's so much to hate you for
I love you, I can't touch you anymore
