[Intro: Pharrell]
Earth to your brain
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, Houston, I think we have a problem
Yo, yo, I think we have a problem
Yo, yo, yo, we have a problem
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
[Verse 1: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
Days, you know those days
When everyone seems to aggravate you
And face fucked up ways (
Ways
)
Don't try to ignore you know that it's true
So you say to yourself that you really don't wanna deal (
Deal
)
And this day to day action on earth just don't appeal
(
I hate this, I hate this
)
[Pre-Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
You know how hard you try (
Try
)
You've can only take so much (
Take it
)
They shoot at you 'cause you're fine
Bite the bullet, I know that it sucks
If security's there then faith will pull you through
If you still angry, follow me and do what I do
(
What, what, let's go
)[Chorus: Kelis]
Do you hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Do you think we can conquer the world?
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go *laser sounds*
To the light in every one
Yeah, you want some friends (
Yeah
)
Seems like everybody has tons
Depends on what you call friends (
What
)
You don't really care ,you just want one
It's a person full of feelings but nobody's there (Nobody's there)
But you have to ask yourself if they were
Would they really care
They do bullshit some times
They do the things that you've done
They're people just like you
But tell me do you really want one (
Yeah
)
Ninety-eight percent of faith won't follow through (
Man, why do you say that?
)
Don't you know real magic comes from the other two?
[Chorus: Kelis]
Do you hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Do you think we can conquer the world?
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go *laser sounds*
To the light in every one
Do you hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Do you think we can conquer the world?
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go *laser sounds*
To the light in every one[Verse 3: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
It was last week we were watching TV (
Yeah
)
My boyfriend wanted to watch Channel Three
Then he started to freak (
What?
)
The newsflash came on then
So I said, "Hey, my popcorn's burnin'" (
What?
)
"Hey, why's the channel turnin'?"
"Hey, that was NASA? What'd they want?"
"Hey, yo, just pass the blunt"
I was so high that I (
What
) didn't realize what they said
Plus my eye vision fried
If not, it's messing with my head
Hey, you can't be serious
Hey, but I need my chronic
Hey, float and spin
Hey, so I turned and I said, shit
[Chorus: Kelis]
Do you hear what they talkin' 'bout
About to send your Black ass to Mars
That's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout
Money, science, space, and Mars
'Til someday you get familiar
Not just because you'll be hangin' with stars
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
And send your Black ass to mars
Do you hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Do you think we can conquer the world?
Got this whole world running from
This love between a boy and a girl
They're afraid of this chemistry
Plus the speed of light of laser guns
They go *laser sounds*
To the light in every one[Outro: Pharrell]
Yo, yo, yo, oh
Yo, nigga, nigga, yo
Yo, oh
Yo, Star Trak, yo, ha ha, yo, oh
Yo, Kelis, yo, Neptunes, yo, oh
Earth to your brain, yo, oh
UFOs, who knows
Earth to your brain
What, is it already closed?
You're fucked
