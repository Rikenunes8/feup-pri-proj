[Verse 1]
Waking up I see you dreaming of a drive in
Open your eyes to see TV-set in blue
I've been waiting for you to smile, I'm the great head freezing
Wintertime comes summer, you are why it's happening, to me
[Chorus]
Sugar babe, sugar babe do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
Sugar now, sugar now do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
[Verse 2]
I feel the morning slip in sights into your mirror
Now I see what you might see, it's pretty clear
I been looking just to feel that funny feeling
I don't know but it's a mystery to reckon, right you
[Chorus]
Sugar babe, sugar babe do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
Sugar now, sugar now do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
