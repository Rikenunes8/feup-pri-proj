[Verse 1]
You're walking 'round in my memory
That only gets stronger and stronger
Smudged mascara and pill-shaped eyes
Everything you want was bought with lies
[Verse 2]
But what can I do about it
They say you won't last any longer
All the gates of love you won't walk through
The only gates you see are colored blue
[Chorus]
I see you peering through frosted windows
Eyes don't smile, all they do is cry
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
[Verse 3]
Oh how can I live without her
The doctors won't let me see her
But I can catch a glimpse through the doorway
Of the girl that I love and care for
[Chorus]
I see you peering through frosted windows
Eyes don't smile, all they do is cry
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
