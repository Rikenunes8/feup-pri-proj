[Mitch Mitchell]
Good evening, ladies and gentleman
Welcome to radio station EXP
Tonight we are featuring an interview
With a very peculiar looking gentleman
Who goes by the name 
Mr. Paul Caruso
On the dodgy subject of are there or are there not flying saucers or UFOs?
Um, please 
Mr. Caruso
, could you give us your regarded opinion on this nonsense about spaceships and even space people?
[Jimi Hendrix]
Thank you
As you all know, you just can't believe everything you see and hear, can you?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way
[Mitch Mitchell]
Eh, but, but, but, but
Huh, I don't believe it
[Instrumental outro 0:40-1:55]
