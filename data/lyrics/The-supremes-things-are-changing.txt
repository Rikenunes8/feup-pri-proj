[Intro]
Girls, have you got the kind of man everyone looks up to?
Well, if you don't, listen, I'll tell you what to do
Get your man, take him by the hand and bring him here to me
And I'm going to tell you about equal opportunity
[Verse 1]
There was a time when the world was fickle
And it may have been hard to succeed
But times have changed now
And school and training is all you really need
[Chorus]
It doesn't matter who you may be
Everyone's equal with the same opportunity
Yes, things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Now is the time for you to better yourself, ooh
[Verse 2]
Life's got problems, but you can make it
And I'm going to tell you why
Just like the early bird that catches the worm
You gotta get up, go out and try
[Chorus]
Your race or colour won't stand in your way
Don't wait for tomorrow, today is your day
Yes, things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Now is the time for you to better yourself
[Bridge]
Good jobs are out there (Things are changing)
Just waiting to be found (Things are changing)
They won't come to you, oh no (Things are changing)
You gotta go out and look around[Chorus]
Your race or colour won't stand in your way
Don't wait for tomorrow, today is your day
Oh, things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Now is the time for you to better yourself
[Outro]
I said, things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
Things are changing for the better
