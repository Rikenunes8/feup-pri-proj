[Verse 1]
Come on little kiddie, get your head on right
Come on little kiddie, get your head on straight
You're gonna get down, you're gonna finger to her
You're gonna fuck Madonna
You're gonna see her, oh!
[Verse 2]
Forget about the lights, girls, and the cars
They never helped somebody, so far
Grab a hold, gonna hold
You're gonna stick it to her, you're gonna stick it to her
[Chorus]
Gary got a boner
Gary's got a boner
Gary got a boner
Gary's got a boner, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
You locked that door, lock up that window
Tell your sister just that opinion
My heartache will find a way
You're gonna stick it to her, yeah, you're gonna stick it to her
[Chorus]
Gary got a boner
Gary's got a boner
Gary's got a soft-on
But not for long, long, long, long
Let it go!
You know
[Chorus / Outro]
Gary got a boner
Gary got a boner
Gary's got a boner
Gary's got a boner
No, no, no, no, no, no
Gary's got a boner, no, no, no
Gary's got a boner, no, no, no
Gary's got it, he's got it
