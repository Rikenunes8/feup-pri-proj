[Verse 1]
September girls
 do so much
I was your Butch, and you were touched
I loved you, well, never mind
I've been crying all the time
[Chorus]
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
[Verse 2]
September girls, I don't know why
How can I deny what's inside?
Even though I'll keep away
They will love all our days
[Chorus]
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
[Bridge]
When I get to bed late at night
That's the time she makes things right
Ooh, when she makes love to me
(Ooh)
