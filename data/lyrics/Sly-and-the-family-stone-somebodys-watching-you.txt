[Verse 1]
Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free
Ever stop to think about a downfall?
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time
[Chorus]
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
[Verse 2]
Games are to be played with toys, et cetera
Love is to be made when you're for real
Ups and downs are caused by life in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel
Shady as a lady in a moustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends[Chorus]
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
[Verse 3]
Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon
The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed
[Chorus]
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Somebody, somebody's watching you)
Somebody's watching you (Somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Somebody)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Watching you)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
