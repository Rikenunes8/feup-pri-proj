I was born in Louisiana, I was raised in Algiers
And everywhere I been, the peoples all say
Ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down
I was walking through the alley with my hand in my coat
The police start to shoot me, thought it was something I stole
You know it ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down
The peoples on the highway is walking and crying
Some is starving, some is dying
You know it ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down
You may go to Hollywood and try to get on the screen
But I'm gonna stay right here and eat these old charity beans
'Cause it ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down
