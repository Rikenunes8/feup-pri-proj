[Verse 1]
Trapped in heaven life style
 
(locked in Long Kesh)
New looking out for pleasure
 
(H-block torture)
It's at the end of the rainbow
 
(white noise in)
The happy ever after
 
(a white room)
[Chorus]
Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
Is at the end of the rainbow
[Verse 2]
Dig at the root of the problem
 
(Fly the flag on foreign soil)
It breaks your new dreams daily (H-block Long Kesh)
Fathers contradictions 
(Censor six counties news)
And breaks your new dreams daily 
(each day more deaths)
[Chorus]
Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
Is at the end of the rainbow
[Bridge]
White noise in a white room
White noise in a white room
White noise in a white room
White noise in a white room
[Verse 3]
Trapped in heaven life style
 
(locked in Long Kesh)
New looking out for pleasure
 
(H-block torture)
It's at the end of the rainbow
 
(white noise in)
The happy ever after
 
(a white room)
[Chorus]
Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
Is at the end of the rainbow[Verse 4]
Dig at the root of the problem
 
(Fly the flag on foreign soil)
It breaks your new dreams daily (H-block Long Kesh)
Fathers contradictions 
(Censor six counties news)
And breaks your new dreams daily 
(each day more deaths)
[Chorus]
Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
Is at the end of the rainbow
[Outro]
There may be oil
(Now looking out for pleasure)
Under Rockall
(It's at the end of the rainbow)
There may be oil
(The happy ever after)
Under Rockall
(It's corked up with the ether)
There may be oil
(It's corked up with the ether)
Under Rockall
(It's corked up with the ether)
There may be oil
