[Chorus]
It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
[Verse 1]
The hades ladies are dressed to kill
Dagger glares from Richard Hell
Tension heightening heating frightening
Thunder rolls as fast as lightening
If you've got the urge
Come on, let's submerge
[Chorus]
It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
We're going down
To the underground
[Chorus]
It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
[Verse 2]
The subterranean is a bottomless pit
The vinyl vultures are after it
Moulten lava, sulphur vapours
Smoulder on to obligerate usIf you've got the urge
Come on, let's submerge
[Chorus]
It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
Down, we're going down
To the underground
