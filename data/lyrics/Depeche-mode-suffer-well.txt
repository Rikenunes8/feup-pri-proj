[Verse 1]
Where were you when I fell from grace?
Frozen heart, an empty space
Something's changing, it's in your eyes
Please don't speak, you'll only lie
[Verse 2]
I found treasure not where I thought
Peace of mind can't be bought
Still, I believe
[Chorus]
I just hang on, suffer well
Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell
[Verse 3]
An angel led me when I was blind
I said, "Take me back, I've changed my mind"
And now I believe
From the blackest room, I was torn
You called my name, a love was born
So I believe
[Chorus]
I just hang on, suffer well
Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell
I just hang on, suffer well
Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell
