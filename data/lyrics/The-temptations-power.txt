[Verse 1: Richard Street & 
Dennis Edwards
]
My hands are clean
My heart is so pure
The world is sick
I am the cure
I don't want no money, gold or gifts
Give me your minds and souls to lift
Put you faith and trust in me
I'll move your mountains
Part your sea
[Pre-Chorus: The Temptations & 
Melvin Franklin
]
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
Get off your knees, believe in me
I'll set you free
All I need's a little more
[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
Power (Must have it)
Power (Power)

Dennis Edwards

I have for you a master plan
To lead you to the Promised Land
I give you peace (Peace), I give you pride (Pride)
I save you from mass suicide
I'm your hope, your one salvation
I'm your one man United Nation
[Pre-Chorus: The Temptations & 
Melvin Franklin
]
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
Tell me your sins, I'll be your friend
I won't do you in
All I need's a little more

We'll march the world down in defeat
Take the fields of oil and the lands of wheat

One thing I must make perfectly clear
Nuclear weapons, all men fear
Their hands sweat, their fingers itch
I'm the only one you can trust with the switch
