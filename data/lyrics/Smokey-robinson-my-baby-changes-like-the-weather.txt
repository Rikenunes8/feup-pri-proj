Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, shine on, sunshine
Keep on shinin' bright
Shine on, sunshine
Today her love is alright

Who knows what's in store for tomorrow?
My life may be filled with sorrow
'Cause my baby (Changes like the weather)
Say it one more time
(Baby changes like the weather)

Don't you rain, rain
Don't bring me tears and pain
Don't hang the dark clouds over me
A golden rainbow's all I need

Give me a hint of what tomorrow will bring
My baby's love is never the same

Because my baby (Changes like the weather)
Ooh, my baby (Changes like the weather)

It doesn't matter what season it is
(No, no, no, no, no)
It doesn't matter 'bout the time of the year
(No, no, no, no)
Some days she's happy, some days she's sad
Some days she's cold and she makes me so mad
C'mon and shine out, sunshine
Keep on shinin' bright
The smile on someone who still thinks love is alright

No matter what's in store for tomorrow
I'm prepared for happiness and sorrow

'Cause my baby (Changes like the weather)
Ooh, my baby (Changes like the weather)

No matter what's in store for tomorrow
I'm prepared for happiness and sorrow

'Cause my baby (Changes like the weather)
Ooh, my baby (Changes like the weather)

Just like the weather (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Just like the weather (Baby changes like the weather)
Ooh (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Just like the weather (Baby changes like the weather)
