[Verse 1]
And you serve me and I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer and I'll bring mine
Get together and we could have a bad time
[Verse 2]
It's 
affidavit
 swearing time
Sign it on the dotted line
Hold your Bible in your hand
Now all that's left is to find yourself a new band
[Chorus]
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
[Verse 3]
Hold the block on money flow
I move it into joint escrow
Court receiver, laughs and thrills
But in the end we just pay those lawyers their bills
[Verse 4]
And you serve me and I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer and I'll bring mine
Get together and we could have a bad time
[Chorus]
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
Sue me, sue you blues
I'm tired of playing the sue me, sue you blues
