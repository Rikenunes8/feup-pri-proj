Oh, hey brah, how we doin' man?
Alright
It's been a while man, life's so rad
This band's my favorite man, don't ya love 'em?

Aw man, you want a beer?
Alright

This is great, man

Hey, did you know about the party after the show?
Yeah
Aw man, it's gonna be the best, I'm so stoked
Take it easy, brah
I'm me, me be, goddamn, I am

If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

Hey, what's up?
Not much
Um, did you hear about the party?
Yeah
I think I'm gonna go but, um, my friends don't really wanna go
Could I get a ride?

Oh no, it go, it gone, bye-bye (Bye)
Who I? I think, I sink, and I die

If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone

If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone

(I don't want to destroy your tank top)
If you want to destroy my sweater
(Let's be friends and just walk away)
Hold this thread as I walk away
(Good to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone
