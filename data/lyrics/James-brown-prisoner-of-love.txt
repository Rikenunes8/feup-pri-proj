[Verse]
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command i stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
[Outro]
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another, i can't have another for i'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her i'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love [x2]
