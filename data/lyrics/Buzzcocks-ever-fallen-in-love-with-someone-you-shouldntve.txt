[Verse 1]
You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt, and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you, and that's worse
[Refrain]
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?
[Verse 2]
I can't see much of the future
Unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same
[Refrain]
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?
[Verse 3]
You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt, and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I'll only end up losing you, and that's worse
[Refrain]
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?[Instrumental Bridge]
[Refrain]
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?
[Outro]
-'ve fallen in love with?
Ever fallen in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?
