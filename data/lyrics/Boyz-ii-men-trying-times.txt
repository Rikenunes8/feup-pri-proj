[Intro]
Baby, I'm so glad you're here
So many things I wanna tell you
So many things I wanna talk to you about
'Cause you are the strength that I hold on to
And I hope that I am the strength that you hold on to
So we can strive together and be perfect
'Til death do us part
[Verse 1]
The night is gone, the morning's here
And soon it's time to talk about
Where we stand and where we plan to be
Our life long years, I need to know
I keep crying tears of joy
I guess that's what you're put here for
To change these tears of pain to tears of happiness
[Chorus]
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
[Verse 2]
Trials and tribulations
Build up walls in front of our faces
Made of stone
Yet we stand strong enough
To break the walls down to journey on
But I know if we just bond our hearts
There will be nothing that will stand in our way
And we'll be together forever and a day
[Chorus]
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you[Outro]
Through the trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
Through the trying times
They trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
Through the trying times
They trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
