[Intro]
I got a bag of my own
[Verse 1]
Now, baby
Stop all that gabbing
We don't need
No backstabbing
Come take
Take care of all of mine
My good stuff
You know I'm grown
I've got a bag of my own
[Verse 2]
On my good book
I don't back up
Take my tea
From my favorite cup
My groove is still
Out of sight
Got the hook
Protect my love, right
Three times seven
You know I'm grown
I got a bag of my own
Wait a minute
[Chorus]
I sweat all day
And half the night
Taking care of business
Handle it right
My body's built like a
32-20-45 frame
Don't shoot nothing
But ball and chain
Don't knock it if
You don't want to rock it[Bridge]
Hit me, hit me
I know I'm grown
I got a bag of my own
[Verse 3]
Can't get enough
Got to, got to do my stuff
Hit me, hit me
I got a bag of my own
Baby, stop all that gabbing
We don't need
No backstabbing
Got to change my ways
Taking care all
Of my good stuff
[Bridge]
You know I'm grown[x2]
Now, hit me
[Chorus 2]
I sweat all day
Half of the night
Taking care of business
Handle it right
My body's built like a
32-20-45 frame
Don't shoot nothing
But ball and chainShoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, ahhh
[Bridge]
Hit me, good God
Got to change my ways[x2]
Come on, come on, band
Hit me, hit me, hit me[x2]
[Outro]
Hit me, good God
I got a bag of my own[x2]
Hit me, good God
I, I, I, I got a bag
