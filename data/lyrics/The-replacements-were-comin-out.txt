[Verse 1]
One more chance to get it all wrong
One more chance to get it all wrong
One more night to do it all wrong
One more warning
One more warning sound
[Chorus]
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
[Verse 2]
One more day anyway
One more chance turned away
One more way anyway
Run away, anyway
[Chorus]
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
[Verse 3]
One more chance to get it all wrong
One more time to do it all wrong
One more night to get it half right
One more warning
One more warning sound
[Chorus / Outro]
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
