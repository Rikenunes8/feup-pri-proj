They were three, they were four
They were five hundred miles from their home
From their home
They were five hundred miles from their home

God moves on the water, Casey Jones
[Verse 2]
It was not December and it was not May
It was the fourteenth of April that is Ruination Day
That's the day
The day that is Ruination Day
