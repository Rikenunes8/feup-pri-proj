[Verse 1]
Someone stoptheworld
Seems like the moment has come and I'm gonna get you girl
The shadows are forming across your parts, the vision looks absurd
No one around to interrupt the feelings you stir
[Chorus]
Imagine if it was, if this was you, if this wasn't
So perfectly designed
To be here all night
Let the world rage outside
Cause, when I'm here with you, the world stops for me
The world stops for me
[Verse 2]
And then extraordinary, ordinary things
Things I can't explain with subtext, the world stops for me
And girl you know just what I mean
I, I need you, girl
Sing me a song
Sing it soft, sing it long
Girl stop my world
[Chorus]
Imagine if it was, if this was you, if this wasn't
So perfectly designed to be here all night
Let the world rage outside
Cause, when I'm here with you, the world stops for me
The world stops for me
[Bridge]
Someone stoptheworld
Stop it, stop it, stop it
Someone, someone stoptheworld, stoptheworld
[Outro]
We about to stop the world tonight
We're about to love, we ain't got no worries, no battles
I'm gonna be with my girl tonight
We about to stoptheworld, stoptheworld, stoptheworld
(We about to stoptheworld tonight)
We're about to love, we ain't got no worries, no battlesYou are my own
(We about to stoptheworld tonight)
Make yourself at home
(I'm gonna be with my girl tonight)
And lay here all night long
(We about to stop the world tonight)
