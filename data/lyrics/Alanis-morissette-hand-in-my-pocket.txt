[Verse 1]
I'm broke, but I'm happy
I'm poor, but I'm kind
I'm short, but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high, but I'm grounded
I'm sane, but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost, but I'm hopeful, baby
[Chorus 1]
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is givin' a high five
[Verse 2]
I feel drunk, but I'm sober
I'm young, and I'm underpaid
I'm tired, but I'm working, yeah
I care, but I'm restless
I'm here, but I'm really gone
I'm wrong, and I'm sorry, baby
[Chorus 2]
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be quite all right
'
Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flickin' a cigarette
[Bridge]
[Chorus 3]
And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is givin' a peace sign
[Verse 3]
I'm free, but I'm focused
I'm green, but I'm wise
I'm hard, but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad, but I'm laughing
I'm brave, but I'm chicken shit
I'm sick, but I'm pretty, baby[Chorus 4]
And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well, I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playin' a piano
[Chorus 5]
And what it all comes down to, my friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailin' a taxi cab
