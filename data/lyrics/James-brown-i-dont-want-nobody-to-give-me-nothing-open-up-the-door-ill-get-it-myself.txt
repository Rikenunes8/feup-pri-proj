[Hook]
I don't want nobody to give me nothing
Open up the door, I'll get it myself
[Verse 1]
Don't give me integration, give me true communication
I don't give me sorrow, I want equal opportunity
To live tomorrow
Give me schools and give me better books
So I can read about myself and gain my true looks
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Some of us try as hard as we can
We don't want no sympathy, we just want to be a man
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
We got talents we can use on our side of town
Let's get our heads together and build it up from the ground
When some of us make money
We forget about our people
Gonna forget about our honey, forget about our honey
Do you know, look at here, hey
Come on, I got to have it, come on, I need it
I got to have it, come on, I got to have it
[Interlude]
Lordy... play with your bad self
Come on, baby, come here come here
Got to get myself together
So many things I got to do, so many things I got to see
I don't need no help from you
Tell everybody, mighty hell
All of these things, baby, got to do it myself, come onI gotta have it
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
With you I've sweat and bled
Would I ever find, and block up every blood
[Hook]
[Verse 5]
I'm not gonna tell you what to do
I'm not gonna raise a fuss
But before you make another rule
Let's start by taking care of us
[Hook]
[Verse 6]
Can't get that education and don't you take no bar
Cause we're gonna get this thing together
And you got to get them all
[Hook]
[Outro]
Can you dig the groove, can you make the move?
Can you dig the same, can you make me play?
