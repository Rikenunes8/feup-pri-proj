[Verse 1]
I can hear how you work, practising hard
Playing night and day, woah woah
And it sounds better now
Yes, you improve every time you play, woah woah
[Pre-Chorus]
But it's bad
You're so sad
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin
[Chorus]
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
[Post-Chorus]
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum dum diddle, your darling fiddle
[Verse 2]
But I think you don't know that I exist
I'm the quiet kind, woah woah
From the day when I first listened to you
You've been on my mind, woah woah
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't care
It's not fair
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin
[Chorus]
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby[Post-Chorus]
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
[Chorus]
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
[Post-Chorus]
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum dum diddle, your darling fiddle
