I sat up here in my window
Lookin down on the street
Strychnine poison woman
Man don't you look so sweet
I said come on up and see me sometime
I'm just a drunken sailor but I'm feeling so fine
I've been out sailin on the seven seas
Baby won't ya give it to me
Baby won't ya drive me mad
Baby don't ya let me feel bad
Baby don't ya leave me alone
Baby won't ya carry me home
Baby won't ya jump and shout
You know what i'm talking about
Baby won't ya drive me wild
Baby let me see you smile
I see all the sickly, salty swingers
Standing on the barroom floor
Sliding and gliding as she past by my window
She was a female mercenary coming home from the war
The ultimate inflection of the word perfection
I thought I'd drop by and say hi
Sweetly serenely she showed me her gun
Baby let's go get highBaby won't ya drive me wild
Baby let me see you smile
Baby won't ya please come here
Baby don't ya have no fear
Baby won't ya scratch my back
Baby don't ya leave me mad
Baby won't ya drive me mad
Baby don't ya let me be mad
I sat down to the matters at hand
Trying to find a way to beat the heat
Outside my window was a bunch of tipsy gypsys
Dancin' up and down the street
The lovely senorita took me by my hand
She said, "Oh, baby won't you be my man"
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Baby let's have a good time
Baby won't ya drive me mad
Baby don't ya let me feel bad
Baby don't ya leave me alone
Baby won't ya carry me home
Baby won't ya jump and shout
You know what i'm talking about
Baby won't ya drive me wild
Baby let me see you smileBaby won't you please come here
Baby don't you have no fear
Baby let me hold your hand
Baby let me be your man
Baby won't you scratch my back
Baby don't you leave me mad
Baby won't you please be true
Baby let's ??? for you
Baby won't you drive me mad
Baby won't you let me be bad
Baby don't you leave me alone
Baby won't you carry me home
Baby won't you scream and shout
You know what i'm talking about
Baby won't you drive me wild
Baby let me see you smile
