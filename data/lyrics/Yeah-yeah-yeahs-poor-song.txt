Baby I'm afraid of a lot of things but
I ain't scared of loving you
And baby I know you're afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared of love, cause
People will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits time just don't erase
And baby I can see you've been fucked with too
But that don't mean your loving days are through
Cause people will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I may be just a fool
But I know you're just as cool
And cool kids, they belong together
