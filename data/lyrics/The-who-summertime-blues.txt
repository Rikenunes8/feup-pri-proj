Well, I'm a gonna raise a fuss, I'm a gonna raise a holler
I've been working all summer just to try and earn a dollar
Well, I went to the boss, said I got a date
The boss said "No Dice, son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder, what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well, my mom and poppa told me, "Son you gotta earn some money
If you want to use the car to go out next Sunday"
Well, I didn't go to work, I told the boss I was sick
He said "You can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder, what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problems to the United Nations
Well, I went to my congressman, he said, quote
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder, what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
