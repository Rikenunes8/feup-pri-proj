[Intro]
I remember it all started in 1929
When me and Diana came to Alaska
To homestead some of this free government land
[Verse 1]
Forty miles from the nearest gravel road
We cut our life in the ponderosa pines
We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
But the cabin's up and we've got lots of time
[Chorus]
What have you got planned tonight, Diana?
Would you consider lying in my arms?
I love you more than ever now, Diana
I'm sure you're the reason I was born
[Verse 2]
Jim was born the first year we were here
Look at him, my God, he's almost grown
The baby's in the cradle fast asleep
Just think, in no time, he'll be up and gone
[Chorus]
What have you got planned tonight, Diana?
Would you consider lying in my arms?
I love you more than ever now, Diana
I'm sure you're the reason I was born
[Verse 3]
The time sure does fly, doesn't it, Diana?
It's been almost two years now since, since you've been gone
Speaking of time, I guess you know that mine's about up
I'm going to see you tonight
Just another breath or two and I'll be home
By the way[Chorus]
What have you got planned tonight, Diana?
Would you consider lying in my arms?
I love you more than ever now, Diana
I'm sure you're the reason I was born
