[Verse 1]
My heart was breaking
Till you started making me
Feel like a natural man
My mind was mess
Until you brought happiness
And that's not hard to understand
When I'm through working
Just fussing and cussing
I'll be there just as quick as I can
[Chorus]
Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo
[Verse 2]
I know living is taking and giving
Baby I'm giving you my best
One of these days you know
I'm going to go crazy
In the middle of your caress
When the day goes down
Honey I'll be around
Why don't you wear your pretty red dress
[Chorus]
Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo[Verse 3]
Every morning our love is reborn
And it lives with me all day long
Things start changing
Take as a little rearranging
But our love grows on and on
Stars who shine in love
Are making you mine to love
I've never felt a love so strong
[Chorus]
Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo
