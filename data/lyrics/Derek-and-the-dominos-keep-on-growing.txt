[Verse 1]
I was laughing
Playing in the streets, I was unknowing
I didn't know my fate
Playing
The game of love, but never really showing
I thought that love could wait
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was a young man and sure to go astray
You walked right into my life
And told me love would find a way
[Chorus]
To keep on growing
Keep on growing
Keep on growing
[Verse 2]
I was standing
Looking in the face of one who loved me
Feeling so ashamed
Hoping
And praying, Lord, that she could understand me
But I didn't know her name
[Pre-Chorus 2]
She took my hand in hers and told me I was wrong
She said, "You're gonna be all right, boy
Oh, just as long"
[Chorus]
"As you keep on growing
Keep on growing
Keep on growing"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Solo]
Maybe[Verse 3]
Maybe
Someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord
Just you wait and see
We'll be walking
Together hand in hand, along forever
Woman, just you and me
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Cause time is gonna change us
Lord, and I know it's true
Our love is gonna keep on glowing
And growing and it's all we gotta do
[Chorus]
Keep on growing
Keep on growing
Keep on growing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep on growing
Keep on growing
Keep on growing
