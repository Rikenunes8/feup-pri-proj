How can I hope to make you understand
Why I do what I do?
Why I must travel to a distant land
Far from the home I love
Once I was happily content to be
As I was, where I was
Close to the people who are close to me
Here in the home I love
Who could see that a man could come
Who would change the shape of my dreams?
Helpless now I stand with him
Watching older dreams grow dim
Oh, what a melancholy choice this is
Wanting home, wanting him
Closing my heart to ev'ry hope but his
Leaving the home I love
There where my heart has settled long ago
I must go, I must go
Who could imagine I'd be wand'ring so
Far from the home I love?
Yet there with my love, I'm home
