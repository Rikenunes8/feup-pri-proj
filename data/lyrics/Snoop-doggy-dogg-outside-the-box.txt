(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)

Somebody just did
The D-O double G be feelin' festive
Got Santa and his elves working 'round the clock
Holidays are here so the show don't stop
Got chow mei, chow lo, oh
It's Christmas, so child, ho, ho, ho
You know I got my gold leaf burgers on the way
On a solid gold tray
On a solid gold sleigh
Ice skatin' to your door when the snow falls
(What you got, Snoop?)
Carbonara with them dough balls
Yes, please, feast at the crib, see
Catch burritos droppin' down the chimney
Hear the jingle bells? It must be
Stuffed crust cheese (Oh, cheese)
Trust me, I keep it poppin' like the hot jerk chicken that I got in my stockin'

Happy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas
Lotta treats to complete on the wishlist
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)
Tell Santa I ain't ask twice
Everything I order, both naughty and nice
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu

Ain't nothin' changed here
Gettin' sushi delivered by a reindeer
Most wonderful time of the year
It's a "Just Eat anything" vibe over here
Think outside the box if your plan is
Nothin' more than a cold turkey sandwich (Cold turkey sandwich, no)
Gotta pimp that'll meal like a mac
Limitless snacks in my Just Eat sack (Woo, what?)
You ever see an elf carryin' a roast ham? (Uh-huh)
When I sit in the whip bumpin' slow jams
The weather outside turn cold and
I stay cooler than a iced up snowman
Warmin' up with a miso soup
Me so bossy, and me so Snoop
Got my man Mister Claus on the line
Let him know that it's Just Eat time

Oh, didn't know? Well you know now
Put your feet up, you ain't gotta go out
Party, food in the blink of an eye
Mistletoe, kiss this year goodbye (Bye-bye)
Now it's December, so remember
You can get anything you sent for, hmm
Nachos, I'm stackin' chips (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Singin' carols with the click and a rack of ribs
The gift of givin' is what I'm in for (That's all)
Got tinsel wrapped around a spring roll
Yep, hit the pad with my pad thai
Bringin' joy to the world, I'm that guy
