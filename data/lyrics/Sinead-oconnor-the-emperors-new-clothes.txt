[Verse 1]
It seems years since you held the baby
While I wrecked the bedroom
You said it was dangerous after Sunday
And I knew you loved me
He thinks I just became famous
And that's what messed me up
But he's wrong
How could I possibly know what I want
When I was only twenty-one?
There's millions of people
Who offer advice and say how I should be
But they're twisted and they will never be
Any influence on me
But you will always be
You will always be
[Chorus]
If I treated you mean
I really didn't mean to
But you know how it is
And how a pregnancy can change you
[Verse 2]
I see plenty of clothes that I like
But I won't go anywhere nice for a while
All I want to do is just sit here
And write it all down and rest for a while
I can't bear to be in another city
One where you are not
I would return to nothing without you
If I'm your girlfriend or not
[Chorus]
Maybe I was mean
But I really don't think so
You asked if I'm scared and I
Said so
[Verse 3]
Everyone can see what's going on
They laugh 'cause they know they're untouchable
Not because what I said was wrong
Whatever it may bring
I will live by my own policies
I will sleep with a clear conscience
I will sleep in peace[Chorus]
Maybe it sounds mean
But I really don't think so
You asked for the truth, and I
Told you
[Outro]
Through their own words
They will be exposed
They've got a severe case of
The emperor's new clothes
The emperor's new clothes
Emperor's new clothes
The emperor's new clothes
