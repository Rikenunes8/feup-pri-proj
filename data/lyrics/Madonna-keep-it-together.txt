[Intro]
One, two, three, hit it!
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
[Verse 1]
I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle, tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home"
[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold
[Verse 2]
I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back
[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold
[Bridge]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance
[Refrain]
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be
[Bridge]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold
[Outro]
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
