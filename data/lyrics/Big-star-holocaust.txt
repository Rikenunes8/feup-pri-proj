Your eyes are almost dead, can't get out of bed
And you can't sleep
You're sitting down to dress, and you're a mess
You look in the mirror
You look in your eyes
Say you realize
Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind
Everybody goes, as far as they can
They don't just care
They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your airs
Your mother's dead, she said
"Don't be afraid"
Your mother's dead, you're on your own
She's in her bed
Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind
Everybody goes, as far as they can
They don't just care
You're a wasted face, you're a sad-eyed lie
You're a holocaust
