[Verse]
I am a big man, yes I am
And I've got a big gun
Got me a big ol' dick and I
I like to have fun
Held against your forehead
And I'll make you suck it
Maybe I'll put a hole in your head
You know, just for the fuck of it
I can reduce you if I want
I can devour
I'm hard as fucking steel
Iâ€™ve got the power
I'm every inch a man
And I'll show you somehow
Me and my fucking gun
Nothing can stop me now
[Chorus]
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm going to come all over you
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm going to come all over you
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm going to come all over you
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm going to come all over you
[Outro]
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
Me and my fucking gun
