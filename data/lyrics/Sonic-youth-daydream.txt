The Wonder

I see flashing eyes
They're flashing 'cross to me
Burning up the sky
Sunshining into me
Your locus crown
A cop-killing heartbeat
Head's looking down
Bowing out to the street
I'm just walking around
Your city is a wonder town

Lips red to white
Lips green in blacked night
Your spirit flares
Flaring up leonine

I'm just walking around
Your city is a wonder town

Transmitter rhyme
Transmitter all the time
Looking up to the sky
I'm seeing ghosts flying

I'm just walking around
Your city is a wonder town

I think I've been there once before
Something tells me there's so much more
She's back in town to even the score
It's time to go
I see flashing eyes
They're flashing 'cross to me
Burning up the sky
Sunshining into me
Your locus crown
A cop-killing heartbeat
Head's looking down
Bowing out to the street

I'm just walking around
Your city is a wonder town
Hyperstation

Falling out of sleep, I hit the floor
I pull on some rock tee and I'm out with the door
From Bowery to Broome to Greene, I'm a walking lizard
Last night's dream was a talking baby wizard

All coming from female imagination
Daydreaming days in a daydream nation
Smashed up against a car at 3 AM
The kids dressed up for basketball beat me in my head
There's bum trash in my hall and my place is ripped
I totaled another amp, I'm calling in sick

It's an anthem in a vacuum on a hyperstation
Daydreaming days in a daydream nation
Eliminator Jr.â€‹

Tears cruise away, packed and then took a shit
The sky is ours, dark stains on his pants
Enough to make him blush around the bone
Take a walk in the park? Shit, yeah!

It's a poor boy, a rich boy
A poor rich boy coming right through me
Rich boy, poor boy
Poor rich boy coming right through me
