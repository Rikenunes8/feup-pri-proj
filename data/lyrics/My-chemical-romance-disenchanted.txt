[Intro]
Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene
[Verse 1]
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, "You won't feel a thing"
And as we ran from the cops, we laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, woah
[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so wrong (
So wrong, so wrong
)
How can you listen all night long? (
Night long, night long
)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing
[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
[Verse 2]
I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine, we'll show 'em what we all mean
Yeah, yeah, woah
[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so wrong (
So wrong, so wrong
)
How can you listen all night long? (
Night long, night long
)
Now, will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing
[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you[Post-Chorus]
So go, go away
Just go, run away
But where did you run to?
And where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay
[Bridge]
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you, come on
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
[Outro]
At all
At all
At all
At all
