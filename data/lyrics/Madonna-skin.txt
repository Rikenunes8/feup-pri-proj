[Intro]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
(Put your hand on my skin)
(Put
 your hand on my skin)
(Put
 your hand on my skin)
[Verse 1]
Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to make a connection
I'm walking on a thin line
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
[Chorus]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
[Verse 2]
Touch me, I'm trying
To see inside of your soul
I've got this thing
I want to make a correction
I'm not like this all the time
You've got this thing
You've got this thing
[Chorus]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
[Bridge]
Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to have your protection
I close my eyes
I close your eyes
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me)[Chorus]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
[Outro]
Kiss me, I'm dying
Touch me, I'm trying, oh
I'm not like this all the time
I'm not like this all the time
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin
Touch me, I'm trying, oh
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin
I'm not like this all the time
I'm not like this all the time
I'm not like this all the time
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin
