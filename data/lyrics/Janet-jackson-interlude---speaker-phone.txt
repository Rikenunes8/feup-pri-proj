I get so lonely
I can't let just anybody hold me
You're the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you

Hello?
Hi, it's me
You got me on that damn speaker phone
Yeah, I do
What you doin' with your hands that you can't pick up the phone?
Don't you worry about it, I'm taking care of my business
What you doing?
Hold on, let me just, okay, here we go, I'm back
I'm, I'm goin' out tonight, maybe
Wait, hold on
Your coochie gon' swell up and fall apart
