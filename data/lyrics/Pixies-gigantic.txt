[Verse 1]
And this I know, his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips she said
She said
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
[Chorus]
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
[Verse 2]
Lovely legs, they're a...
What a big black mess, what a hunk of love
He'd walk her every day into a shady place
He's like the dark, but I'd want him
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
[Chorus]
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
