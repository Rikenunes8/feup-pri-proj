[Verse 1]
China, all the way to New York
I can feel the distance getting close
You're right next to me, but I need an airplane
I can feel the distance as you breathe
[Chorus]
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you
How can I when you build the Great Wall around you?
In your eyes I saw a future together
Oh, you just look away in the distance
[Verse 2]
China decorates our table
Funny how the cracks don't seem to show
Pour the wine, dear, you say we'll take a holiday
But we never can agree on where to go
[Chorus]
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you
How can I when you build the Great Wall around you?
In your eyes I saw a future together
Oh, you just look away in the distance
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
China all the way to New York
Maybe you got lost in Mexico
You're right next to me, I think that you can hear me
Funny how the distance learns to grow
[Chorus]
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you
How can I when you build the Great Wall around you?
[Outro]
I can feel the distance
I can feel the distance
I can feel the distance getting close
