[Verse 1]
I'm the horny loser
You'll find me crashing through my mother's door
I am the ugly lover
You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor
[Chorus]
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
[Verse 2]
I'm a belly dancer
I'll shake forever and I'll never care
I'm a building jumper
Roof to roof, you see me flying in the air
[Chorus]
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Bones
[Outro]
Somebody got hurt
Somebody get hurt
Somebody got hurt
