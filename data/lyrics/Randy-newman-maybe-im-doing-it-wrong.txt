Maybe I'm doing it wrong
Maybe I'm doing it wrong
It just don't move me
The way that it should
Maybe I'm doing it wrong
There ain't no book you can read
There ain't nobody to tell you
But I don't think I'm getting
What everybody's getting
Maybe I'm doing it wrong
Sometimes I throw off a good one
At least I think it is
No, I know it is
But I shouldn't be thinking at all
I shouldn't be thinking at all
Maybe I'm doing it wrong
Maybe I'm doing it wrong
It just don't move me
The way that it should
Maybe I'm doing it wrong
