[Verse 1]
Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why from me
Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the state line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must have known what we were going to find
[Chorus]
This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
[Verse 2]
Stardust
 well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen them rise
I've seen them fall
Some get nothing
And Lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawl away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm going to need you
Down this 
yellow brick road[Chorus]
This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
