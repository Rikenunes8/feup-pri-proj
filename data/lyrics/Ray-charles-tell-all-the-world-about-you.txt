[Verse 1]
When I need company
I call on you to see about me
I want to walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you (Tell the world about you)
When you're with me, there's so much fun
You're all the good things all wrapped in one
I want to walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you (Tell the world about you)
[Bridge]
Whoa, I want to walk (Walk about)
I want to talk (Talk about)
I want to tell (Want to tell the world all about you)
Oh, I want to live (Just for you)
I'm gonna give (Love so true)
We'll have a love (We'll have a love that's fine and new)
[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, you're so fine and you're so sweet
You have a love and it can't be beat
I want to walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you (Tell the world about you)
[Saxophone solo]
[Bridge]
Whoa, I want to walk (Walk about)
I want to talk (Talk about)
I want to tell (Want to tell the world all about you)
Oh, gonna live (Just for you)
I'm gonna give (Love so true)
We'll have a love (We'll have a love that's fine and new)
[Outro]
Oh, oh, you're so fine and you're so sweet
You have a love and it can't be beat
I want to walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about, tell all the world about
Oh, tell the world about you (Tell the world about you)
