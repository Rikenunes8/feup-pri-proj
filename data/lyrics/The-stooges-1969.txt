[Intro]
Well, alright
[Chorus]
Well, it's 1969, okay?
All across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothin' to do
[Verse]
Now, last year I was twenty-one
I didn't have a lot of fun
And now I'm gonna be twenty-two
I say "Oh my" and a, a "Boohoo"
And now I'm gonna be twenty-two
A "Oh my" and a, a "Boohoo"
[Chorus]
Well, it's 1969, okay?
All across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothin' to do
Another year with nothin' to do
[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's 1969
Well, it's 1969
Well, it's 1969, baby
Well, it's 1969, baby
Well, it's 1969
Well, it's 1969
Well, it's 1969
Well, it's 1969
Well, it's 1969, baby
Well, it's 1969, baby
Well, it's 1969, baby
Baby
