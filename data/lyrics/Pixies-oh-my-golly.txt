[Verse 1]
Dentro las piñones y las holas pequeñas
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
Caminamos bajo la luna caribe
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
Besando, chicando con Surfer Rosa
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
Entonces se fue a su manera
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
[Chorus]
Rosa, oh oh, oh, Rosa!
Rosa, oh oh, oh, Rosa!
Huh huh!
[Verse 2]
Yo soy playero pero no hay playa
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
Bien perdida la Surfer Rosa
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
La vida total es una porquería, porquería
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
Me hecho menos más que vida
Oh my golly! Oh my golly!
[Chorus]
Rosa, oh oh, oh, Rosa!
Rosa, oh oh, oh, Rosa!
Huh huh![Chorus]
Rosa, oh oh, ohh Rosa!
Rosa, oh oh, ohh Rosa!
Huh huh!
[Spoken Word: Black Francis]
"You fucking die," I said. To her
I said, "You fucking die!" To her
Huh? What?
No, no. I was talking to Kim
I said, "You fuckin' die."
No, I-- we were just goofin' around
No, no. It didn't have anything to do with anything
She said, "Don't tou- anybody touches my stuff."
And I said, "You fuckin' die," like that
I was finishing her part for her
You know what I mean?
