[Verse 1]
I think about it baby all the time, all right
It feels so good it must be a crime, all right
I want to do it baby every day, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right
[Chorus]
I want to do it baby all the time, all right
Because when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right
[Verse 2]
I could be guilty for my honesty, (All right)
But I've got to tell you what you mean to me, (all right) all right
With you I swear, I'm a maniac, all right
You see it ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right (All right)
[Chorus]
I want to do it baby all the time, all right
Because when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, doing it
[Verse 2]
I could be guilty for my honesty, all right
But I gotta, I've got to tell you what you mean to me, all right
Yeah, I wanna
[Chorus]
I want to do it baby all the time, all right, yeah
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right
I want to do it baby all the time, all right, yeah
You see it ain't no joke, it's so divine, all right, all right
I want to do you baby all the time, all right, yeah
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right
[Verse 3]
You wanna think about it
You wanna think about it baby, all the time
(Think about it all the time) fucking on your mind
(Feels so good, must be a crime)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)[Outro]
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, doing it
(Come on)
(Come on)
