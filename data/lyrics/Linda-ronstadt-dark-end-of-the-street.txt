[Verse 1]
At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
[Chorus]
You and me
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me
[Verse 2]
I know that time is gonna take it's toll
We're gonna pay for the love that we stole
Ah, it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
Ah, but our love keeps coming on strong
[Chorus]
You and me
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me
[Bridge]
They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
Just you and me
[Verse 3]
If you take a walk downtown
And you find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by
Oh darling, please don't cry
[Outro]
Tonight we'll meet
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me, oh, you and me
Oh, God, you and me
