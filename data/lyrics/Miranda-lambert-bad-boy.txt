[Intro]
Saturday's gonna...
Hey, can I ask one more question, what's the intro?
[Verse 1]
Saturday's gonna keep you up all night
'Cause Sunday morning ain't your style
It's been a while since I've seen the sun rise
I'm not sure how you make a living
You can buy me one of whatever you're drinking
I'm thinking my mama warned me about your kind
Sure, you can light my cigarette
Don't think you can light my heart
Don't think I haven't figured you out from the start
[Pre-Chorus]
Giving in to bad boys like you never got me very far
It's trouble now, baby drink it down
You should have seen it coming
[Chorus]
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy for you
[Verse 2]
The more I hear your silence think
The more my curiosity peaks
The more I don't wanna leave this bar alone
The whiskey's making me wonder why
You wear your hat down low, but your walls are high
How long you gonna hide behind them walls of stone?
Sure, you can buy me one more round
Don't think you can buy my heart
Don't think I haven't figured you out from the start
[Pre-Chorus]
Giving in to bad boys like you never got me very far
It's trouble now, baby, drink it down
Ooh, you should have seen it coming[Chorus]
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
Um, I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy, bad boy, for you
[Outro]
Ooh, you should have seen it coming
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, bad boy
