[Verse 1]
Midnight, I've spent another lonely day thinking of you
Midnight, tomorrow is on its way, empty and blue
Still, I'm lonely, so lonely at midnight for you
[Verse 2]
Midnight, oh, what a lonely time to weep, I oughta know
Midnight, I should have been fast asleep hours ago
Still I'm crying, crying 'cause I miss you so
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
Midnight, I lie in bed awake and stare at nothing at all
Wondering, wondering why you don't care, wishing you'd call
Tears keep flowing like drops from a waterfall
[Verse 1]
Midnight, I've spent another lonely day thinking of you
Midnight, tomorrow is on its way, empty and blue
Still, I'm lonely, so lonely at midnight for you
[Outro]
Still, I'm lonely, so lonely at midnight for you
