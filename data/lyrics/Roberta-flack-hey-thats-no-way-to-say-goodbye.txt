I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Many loved before us, I know we are not new
In city and in forest they loved like me and you
Now it's come to distances, both of us must try
Your eyes filled with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you, your love stays with me
It's just the way life changes, like the shoreline of the sea
Let's not talk of love or chains, things we can't untie
Your eyes filled with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

Your eyes filled with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbyeI'm not looking for another as I wander in my time

You know my heart goes with you, your love stays with me
It's just the way life changes, like the shoreline of the sea
But let's not talk of love or chains, things we can't untie
Your eyes are fill with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye
