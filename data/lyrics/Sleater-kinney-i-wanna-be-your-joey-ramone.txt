[Verse 1]
It's fine when it's all mine
It's on my wall, it's in my head
Memorize it 'til I'm dead
It's yours, now, I'm so bored
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Joey Ramone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pictures of me on your bedroom door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Invite you back after the show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the queen of rock and roll
[Verse 2]
I just don't care
Are you that scared?
I swear they're looking right at me
Push to the front so I can see
It's what I thought
It's rock and roll
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Thurston Moore
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wrestle on your bedroom floor
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Always leave you wanting more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw away those old records
[Bridge]
Go downtown
Put on your best frown
Give me a chance
I know I can dance
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Joey Ramone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pictures of me on your bedroom door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Invite you back after the show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the queen of rock and roll[Outro]
I'm fine 'cause it's all mine
