All of me, half of you
On an island in your bedroom
Up all night, seeing sounds
Wondering where you spend the night now

And I was a dead man walking
With bloodshot eyes, right place, wrong time
And you were an angel fallin'
At Duke's on Main, I was yours to take
Even if I had to lose you to know you
I'd still be that temporary phase that you grow through
I wouldn't change, wouldn't change
Wouldn't change fallin' for you
I think I could manage
Being collateral damage

Before you ran back to your ex
And started havin' all your make-up sex

I was a dead man walkin'
With bloodshot eyes, right place, wrong time
And you were an angеl fallin'
At Duke's on Main, I was yours to take
And I'm still that way

Even if I had to losе you to know you
I'd still be that temporary phase that you grow through
I wouldn't change, wouldn't change
Wouldn't change fallin' for you
I think I could manage
Being collateral damage
If my time knew that you'd do nothing with it
I'd still be that cigarette that you couldn't finish
I wouldn't change, wouldn't change
Wouldn't change how it ended
I think I could manage
Being collateral damage
I'd go back to your place again
Say things I'd never say again
Even if my heart breaks again
Again and again

Even if I had to lose you to know you
I'd still be that temporary phase that you grow through
I wouldn't change, wouldn't change
Wouldn't change fallin' for you
I think I could manage
Being collateral damage
If my time knew that you'd do nothing with it
I'd still be that cigarette that you couldn't finish
I wouldn't change, wouldn't change
Wouldn't change how it ended
I think I could manage
Being collateral damage

I'll be collateral damage
I'll be collateral damage
(Collateral damage)
I'll be collateral damage
(Collateral damage)
