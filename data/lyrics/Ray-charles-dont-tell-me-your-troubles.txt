[Verse 1]
Don't tell me your troubles
I got troubles of my own
Don't tell me your troubles
Just leave me alone
[Chorus]
Leave me alone (
Leave me alone
)
Go on home (
Go on home
)
Tell it to a friend (
Talk to a friend
)
I got troubles of my own (
I got troubles of my own
)
[Verse 2]
You say your sweet love left you
Well, what you think about me?
I've got those same old heartbreaks
And the same old misery
[Chorus]
Leave me alone (
Leave me alone
)
Go on home (
Go on home
)
Tell it to a friend (
Talk to a friend
)
I got troubles of my own
[Bridge]
They say it happens to the best of us
That's what they always say
Take it, brother, like a man
And don't stand in my way
[Verse 3]
You tell me that she's no good
She's mean as she can be
It's written all over your lonesome face
Any heartbreak fool can see
[Chorus]
Leave me alone (
Leave me alone
)
Go on home (
Go on home
)
Tell it to a friend (
Talk to a friend
)
I got troubles of my own (
I got troubles of my own
)[Bridge]
It happens to the best of us
That's what they always say
So take it, brother, like a man
And don't stand in my way
[Verse 4]
You tell me that she's no good
She's mean as she can be
It's written all over your lovely face
Any heartbreak fool can see
[Chorus]
Leave me alone (
Leave me alone
)
Go on home (
Go on home
)
Tell it to a friend (
Talk to a friend
)
I got troubles of my own (
I got troubles of my own
)
[Outro]
Oh, leave me (
Leave me alone
)
Go on home (
Go on home
)
Tell it to a friend (
Talk to a friend
)
I got troubles of my own (
I got troubles of my own
)
Oh (
Leave me alone, go on home, talk to a friend
)
Yeah (
I got troubles of my own
)
Oh, trouble now (
Leave me alone
)
Trouble in my home now (
Go on home
)
Leave me alone (
Talk to a friend
)
Oh, yeah (
I got troubles of my own
)
Come on now
