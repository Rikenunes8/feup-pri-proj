Early this mornin'
When you knocked upon my door
Early this mornin' whoooo
When you knocked upon my door
And I said 'hello Satan'
I believe it's time to go
Me and the Devil
Was walkin' side by side
Me and the Devil, whoooo
Was walkin' side by side
And I'm going to beat my woman
Until I get satisfied
She said you don't see why
That I would dog her 'round
Now baby you know you ain't doin' me right don'tcha
She say you don't see why, whoooo
That I would dog her 'round
It must-a be that old evil spirit
So deep down in the ground
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
Baby, I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone
You may bury my body, whoooo
Down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit
Can get a Greyhound bus and ride
