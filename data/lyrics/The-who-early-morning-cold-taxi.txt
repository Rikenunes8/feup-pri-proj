[Verse 1]
Three thirty-six, it's cold
I know I'm growing old
With life's best side on the downward slope
It's in my own hands, I know I'll cope
My girl's with me
And all my friends can see
[Chorus]
Here I am again
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi
[Verse 2]
Done it before, do it again
Know from experience it's not in vain
She's the best I've had, I cannot see
What someone else can do to me
It's a long way home
But love's so warm, you'll see
[Chorus]
Here I am again
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi
[Bridge]
Early morning cold taxi
Each time I do it
I feel so down and out
Early morning cold taxi
Though my mind thinks strange
I'll keep on, no doubt
[Verse 3]
Three thirty-six, it's cold
I know I'm growing old
One day, we'll be wed
This I know, for it's what she said
Then no more
Will my mind be uneasy[Bridge]
Early morning cold taxi
Each time I do it
I feel so down and out
Early morning cold taxi
Though my mind thinks strange
I'll keep on, no doubt
[Verse 4]
Three thirty-six, it's cold
I know I'm growing old
One day, we'll be wed
This I know, for it's what she said
Then no more
Will my mind be uneasy
[Chorus]
Here I am again
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi
