I'm driving alone
Sad about you
Not going home
What's to do
You better not leave me here
Better not leave me here
Ooh I want you here
How can you leave me here
I lie in a stream
And floating fine
Receiving things
In my beautiful mind
Sometimes oh sometimes
Sometimes so sublime
Lover yes I am
Lover you know I am
Now I'm in a bar
That's got to be where they are
Going to dance in the bar
They're going to fight on the floor
Faster than I can see
Now I gonna score
Make for the door
Who is this whore?
Soon be beggin drags
And I'm thinking Christ
Nullify my life
You're going to die
You gonna decease
