[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Today could be a lot of fun
And precious one, I'd feel good just to walk with you
Tonight'll be a special treat
You're so sweet, and I feel good just to talk with you
You know that I been a long time needin' you
You say that you been a long time needin' me
And don't you know that there's so much more to come?
[Pre-Chorus]
I got a heart that just won't stop beating for you
I got a love I just can't stop feeling for you
[Chorus]
Aren't you glad now, darling, there's me and you?
(Tell me, tell me you know what I mean when I say)
Aren't you glad each day, there comes something new?
(Tell me, tell me you know what I mean when I say)
Aren't you glad, now? Tell me you're so glad
[Instrumental Break]
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
[Verse 2]
Today is another day
Another way to get this feeling across to you
Tonight'll be another night
That's outta sight, 'cause I know the way to get close to you
You know that I'll be a long time lovin' you
I hope that you'll be a long time lovin' me
And don't you know that there's so much more to come?
[Pre-Chorus]
I got a heart that just won't stop beating for you
I, I got a love I just can't stop feeling for you[Chorus/Outro]
Aren't you glad now, darling, there's me and you?
(Tell me, tell me you know what I mean when I say)
Aren't you glad each day, there comes something new?
(Tell me, tell me you know what I mean when I say)
Aren't you glad, now? Tell me you're so glad...
