[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo
Ayo, yo, yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo
Ayo, yo, yo, yo
Ayo, Missy, fuck that
I just came out here an hour and twenty-five minutes
On one of them Gilligan Island shits from New York to Virginia
Word up, came out here to visit your ass, and you playin' shit like this up in my ears
Fuck you think you doin' thinkin' I ain't gon' get on this motherfucker before I bounce?
Yo, check this out, let me hit you with this real shit real quick, Missy
One shot, baby, just let me do my shit for a minute on your shit
Check it out
[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Aha, aha, I continue to disregard all y'all's opinion
Aha, blast your whole ass into oblivion
Aha, aha, makin' New York with Virgin-agins
Aha, shit be bangin', aha
Can you disagree? Uh-uh
Before I smoke this and get a little drunk and get a little pissy
When I'm finished with music, I'ma make all ya'll motherfuckers miss me
See, who is he?
You see that girl right there, who is she?
Busta Rhymes and Missy
Niggas come around Missy, don't act like a fuckin' sissy
No chicken-heads allowed here, no time for the kissy-kissy
And when they askin', "Who is he?" (Who?)
I be Busta Ryhmes, the phenomenal of get busy
Strictly major effective, y'all niggas know the drilly
We gettin' money together, track the stacks and then count 'em
Y'all niggas stay tuned for the rest of my homegirl Missy album
[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Word bond
Flip Mode is the motherfuckin' squad
Busta Rhymes comin' in right here with this quick lil' drop on you
Ayo, y'all niggas stay focused
Keep your eyes and your ears tuned in on this fulfillin' shit
Missy LP number one (Ha)
Blossomin' like beautiful flowers on all y'all motherfuckers
