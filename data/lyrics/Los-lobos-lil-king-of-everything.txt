I can see it in your eyes
And it makes it hard to say goodbye tonight
The stars are shining in the sky
And love is waiting for you and I
Let's stay up and forget about getting up
Tonight is just about you and me
There's no where else to go
And no one will ever know
And we'll dance this way
Till the hands fall off the clock
Listen to your heart
'Cause hearts never lie
Leave your cares behind
For someone else to find
Oh, I can see it in your eyes
And it makes it hard to say goodbye tonight
And the stars are shining in the sky
And love is waiting for you and I
Let's stay up, forget about getting up
Tonight is just about you and me
There's nowhere else to go
And no one will ever know
And we'll dance this way
Till the hands fall off the clock
