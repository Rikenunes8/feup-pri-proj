[Chorus]
Tomorrow night
Will it be just another memory?
Tomorrow night
All that thrilled me, gone
Tomorrow night, mm
Honey can I hold you, hold you in my arms tonight?
Tomorrow night
All those lovely things you said goodnight
[Verse 1]
Your lips are so tender
Your heart is beating fast
It tells me, darling, you surrender darling
Tell me, honey, will it last?
[Chorus]
Tomorrow night
Will it be just another memory?
Tomorrow night
All those lovely things you said goodnight
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Your lips are so tender
Your heart is beating fast
Tell me, tell me honey will you surrender?
Tell me, darling, will it last?
[Chorus]
Tomorrow night, mm
Will it be just another memory?
Tomorrow night
All those lovely things you said goodnight
