[Intro: Joe Strummer]
(Oh, yeah)
Hey, Paul
[Verse 1]
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row?
[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
[Pre-Verse]
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of The Harder They Come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun
[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton[Verse 1]
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?
[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
You can even shoot us
But, oh the guns of Brixton
[Verse 3]
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven, as in hell
[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
