If I ever get lucky mama
Win my train fare home
If I get lucky babe
Win my train fare home
I'm going back to the border
Where I'm better known
Oh your calf is hungry mama
Hey baby I believe he needs to suck
Oh your calf is hungry baby
Mama I believe he needs a suck
Oh your milk is turning blue
I believe he's out of luck
Hey yeah, yeah
You know you got me crawling and the grass grows very high
I'm just going to keep on crawling now baby until the day I die
Crawl into your window
Crawl into your door
Crawl anyway you want now
Baby I'm going to crawl across your floor

Yallah Yallah oh Yallah

Well that's all right mama
Baby that's all right for you
Oh that's all right baby
Oh mama that's all right for you
To be low down dirty any old way you do
Oh well oh well

You know you got me crawling now babe and the grass grows very high
I'm just going to keep on crawling now baby until the day I die
Going to craw into your window
Going to crawl into your door
Going to crawl anyway you want now
Baby I'm going to crawl across your floor, crawl across your floor
