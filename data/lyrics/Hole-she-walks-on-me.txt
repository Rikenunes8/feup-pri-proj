[Verse 1]
Geeks do not have pedigrees
Or perfect punk rock resumes
Or anorexic magazines
It smells like girl, it smells like girl
[Chorus]
She walks over me
She walks over me
[Verse 2]
Hold you close like we both died
My ever-pressing suicide
My stupid fuck, my blushing bride
Oh, tear my heart out, tear my heart out
[Chorus]
She walks over me
She walks over me
[Interlude]
I'd shut my mouth with you for a rag
I use the rest of you for a gag
I'd shut my mouth with you for a gag
I use the rest of you
[Verse 3]
Kitty, kitty, please come here
But don't you touch me, don't you dare
We look the same, we talk the same
We are the same, we are the same
[Chorus]
She walks over me
She walks over me
[Interlude]
I'd shut my mouth with you for a rag
I use the rest of you for a gag
I shut my mouth with you for a rag
I use the rest of you[Verse 4]
Nothing's seen, she walk the same
And nothing's seen, she talk the same
You never know what you will get
You never know what you'll forget
[Outro]
She walks over me
She walks over me
She walks
