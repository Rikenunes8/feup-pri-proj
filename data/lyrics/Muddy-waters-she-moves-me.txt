[Chorus]
She moves me man, honey and I don't see how its done[x2]
She got a pocket full of money, little doll don't try to help me though
[Verse 1]
She move me when she get drunk, then she say I'm not nowhere
She call me a dumbbell, she tells me I'm nothing but a square
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
(What kind of woman is that?)
She move a crazy man, who say now I'm not so dumb
I take her to a funeral boy, the dead jumped up to run
She look at a deaf and dumb boy, said now I can speak
She shook her finger in a blind man's face, once I was blind but now I see
[Chorus]
