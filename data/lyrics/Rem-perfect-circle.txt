[Verse 1]
Put your hair back, we get to leave
Eleven gallows on your sleeve
Shallow figure, winners paid
Eleven shadows way out of place
[Chorus]
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
[Verse 2]
Pull your dress on and stay real close
Who might leave you where I left off?
A perfect circle of acquaintances and friends
Drink another, coin a phrase
[Chorus 2]
Heaven assume, shoulders high in the room
Heaven assume, shoulders high in the room
Heaven assume, shoulders high in the room
[Verse 3]
Try to win and suit your needs
Speak out sometimes but try to win
[Chorus]
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
