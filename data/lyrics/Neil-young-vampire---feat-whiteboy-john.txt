Lord a God, I come in to defy laws
Lord a God, they come in to defy Ras
Ay, just ways of Jah laws have left your head
Resolve all to conflict, we'll all soon be dead
Corruption a run and spread like viruses
Freedom and rights will soon come to an end
The righteous man will soon have his day
Kings of the earth shall soon not have a say
Confusion of the wolrd tends to terminate faith
Wicked just a slaughter

The system is a vampire, system is a vampire
Hiring assassinators, lies of a murderer, ey
Vampire, bound to fall empire
I yearn to fight in a just war, following Emperor
Lord a God, I come in to defy laws
Lord a God, they come in to defy Ras

Hear I, glorify up in them minds the riches of one
Foolishness of father is taught to the son
Laws of the earth surpass opinions
Righteousness and justice shall burn racism
Read in Psalms, knowledge of where that man was born
Read in Psalms, of the true throne of Lion
Justice of Jah shall be restored to the land
Wicked will be slaughtered

The system is a vampire, system is a vampire
Hiring assassinators, lies of a murderer, ey
Vampire, bound to fall empire
I yearn to fight in a just war, following Emperor
Lord a God, I come in to defy laws
Lord a God, they come in to defy Ras

Mic check one two dont mind if I do
Take the mic for awhile and try to get through to you
Beware of the system who preys ruthlessly upon you
Its a corrupt authority claiming that they represent you
Guilty of dishonesty, lacking all integrity
They come and try to suck our blood while we are sleeping
Take a look around take a good look at this place
There is no room for intolerance of another race
We nah care if you black white red or if you brown
If you live around here or if you come from out of town
We down with you if you down with us
Wicked just a slaughter...

The systems is a vampire, systems is a vampire
Hiring assassinators, lies of a murderer

Lord a God, Lord a God, Lord a God
