[Verse 1]
Fly away from my window, little bluebird
Fly as far as you can away from here
And let not your song fall upon my ear
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears
For the one that I have loved
He has left me and gone
And I am in no mood for to hear your sad song
[Verse 2]
Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here
Oh, trouble me not, go ye' elsewhere
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears
For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away
And I am in no mood for the sunshine today
[Outro]
Go spread your blue wings
Go light your blue sky
And I'll shed my blue tears
