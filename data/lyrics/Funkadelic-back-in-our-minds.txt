[Chorus]
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again
[Verse]
We don't fight no more
We done closed that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're supposed to be brothers
Livin' in this world we all live in
[Chorus]
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again
[Verse]
We don't fight no more
We done closed that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
We're supposed to be brothers
Livin' in this world we all live in
[Outro]
Back in our minds again
