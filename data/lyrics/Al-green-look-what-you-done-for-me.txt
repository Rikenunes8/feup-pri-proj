[Intro]
Hey baby
[Verse 1]
Now that you're here with me
I want to keep you free
To do the things that you wanna do
The joy in life is loving you
But now the day has come
To let you know where I'm coming from, yeah
The best of my years will go to you
It's the only thing that I can do
But these things don't come overnight
Loving you, baby, and I think I'm right
Let me say before I forget
That loving you, baby, it's where it's at, yeah
[Chorus]
And oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh baby, you set my heart free, yeah
Oh, what a feeling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What a feeling, yeah
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wanna leave, but then I say
It wouldn't make sense, no, anyway
But forgive me baby, if I do wrong
I haven't been a true man for so long
But let me say before I forget
That loving you, baby, it's where it's at, yeah[Chorus]
And oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh baby, you set my heart free, hey
Bread and the water, everything that you oughta
You've been very good for me
And I, I gotta, gotta to say it
Oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh yeah, you set my heart free, hey
[Outro]
Oh, know no better what you done for me
I got this feeling that it's gonnaâ€”hey
And oh, look what you done for me
Baby, baby, you've set my heart free every day
