[Verse 1]
Further we make claims on our teas
Dawn inner here for we've nowhere to be
Nowhere to be
Nowhere to be
[Verse 2]
Father stains, we're all on our knees
Down on our words and we've nothing to be
Nothing to be
Nothing to be
[Verse 3]
Further down we're all on our sails
Paid to appease though we've nothing these days
Nothing these days
Nothing these days
[Verse 4]
Further still, their stall in a daze
We're down on our knees and we've nothing to say
Nothing to say
Nothing to say
