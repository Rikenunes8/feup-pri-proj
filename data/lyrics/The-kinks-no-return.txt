[Verse 1]
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
[Verse 2]
Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return
[Verse 3]
For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long
[Verse 4]
For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return
