Let me be a little kinder, let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those around me, let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be a little braver when temptations bid me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with a brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbor and a little less of me
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little harder for those I'm striving for
Let me be a little meeker with a brother that is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be a little kinder, let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those around me, let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be a little kinder, let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those around me, let me praise a little more
