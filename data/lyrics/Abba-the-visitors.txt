[Verse 1]
I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me
[Verse 2]
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling
[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me
[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling...
