I'm wide awake
What's up with our obsession with our pocket screens?
What's next, is this the future of humanity?
Nice flex, but I don't fuck with all the vanity
Did we come this far to fall
Face first off a ledge, where endless information goes
In a world where instant affirmation flows
If there's a God, He knows we're lost

So look up, it's right there in front of you
You're stuck to your phone like it's superglue
But guess what? (What?)
We're fucked if we think this virtual mentality's
Enough, kick connection out the backdoor
Scroll up, you won't find what you'rе lookin' for
Tough luck, I can't live like this anymore
Thе whole wide world is waitin' if you just look up
Look up
Back and forth, I'm stuck, is human nature all synonymous?
Is this a carbon copy of my consciousness?
Wish my social status could remain anonymous
'Cause I'm tired of hangin' on
To everything that holds me back from knowin' what I really am
Yeah, maybe there's a way that we can understand
But I don't think we have the answer in our hands
You can sit or stand, but hey

Look up, it's right there in front of you
You're stuck to your phone like it's superglue
But guess what? (What?)
We're fucked if we think this virtual mentality's
Enough, kick connection out the backdoor
Scroll up, you won't find what you're lookin' for
Tough luck, I can't live like this anymore
The whole wide world is waitin' if you just look up
Look up
Look up, look up, look up

So look up, it's right there in front of you
You're stuck to your phone like it's superglue
But guess what? (What?)
We're fucked if we think this virtual mentality's
Enough, kick connection out the backdoor
Scroll up, you won't find what you're lookin' for
Tough luck, I can't live like this anymore
The whole wide world is waitin' if you just look up
Look up
Look up, look up, look up
The whole wide world is waitin' if you just look up
Look up
Look up, look up, look up
