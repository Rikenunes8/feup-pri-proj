One two three
One two three
One
Broken glass and the rusty nails
Where the wild violets grow
Say goodbye to the railroad and the 
mad dogs
 of summer
And everything that I know
What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
They're wounded, but they just keep on climbin'
And sleep by the side of the road
There's a hole in the ladder, a fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter, you're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow, the hills are a--green
Sing me a rainbow, steal me a dream
Small time Napoleons shattered his knees
But he stays in the saddle for Rose
And all his disciples, they shave in the gutter
And they gather what's left of his clothes
What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
They're wounded, but they just keep on climbin''
They sleep by the side of the road
