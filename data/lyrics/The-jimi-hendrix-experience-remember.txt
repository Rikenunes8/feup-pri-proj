[Verse 1]
Oh, remember
The mockin' bird, my baby bought;
He used to sing for his supper, baby
Yes, he used to sing for his dinner, baby
He used to sing so sweet
But, uh, since my baby left me
He ain't sang a tune all day
[Verse 2]
Oh, remember
The bluebirds and the honey-bees;
They used to sing for the sunshine
Yes, they used to sing for the honey, baby
They used to sing so sweet
But, ever since my baby left me
Ain't sang a tune all day
Ah, baby
[Bridge]
Hey, pretty baby
Come on back to me
Make everybody
Happy as can be, yeah!
[Guitar solo]
Oh, baby
[Verse 3]
So, baby
If you please come home again
You know I'll kiss you for my supper, yeah
You know I'll kiss you for my dinner, baby, now
But, uh, if you don't come back
You know I'll have to starve to death
'Cause I ain't had a kiss all day, now
All day
[Outro]
Please remember
Got to remember
Yeah!
Got to remember our love
Come on back, uh
Come on back in my arms
Make everything back together
Ahh, baby, hurry up now
Can you hear my callin' you back again, now?
Come on baby
Stop jivin' around
Hurry home, hurry home
