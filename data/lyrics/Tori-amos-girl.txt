[Verse 1]
From in the shadow she calls
And in the shadow she finds a way, finds a way
And in the shadow she crawls
Clutching her faded photograph
My image under her thumb
Yes, with a message for my heart
Yes, with a message for my heart
[Chorus]
She's been everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
[Verse 2]
Hey, and in the doorway they stay
And laugh as violins fill with water
Screams from the bluebells can't make them go away
Well I'm not seventeen
But I've cuts on my knees
Falling down as the winter
Takes one more cherry tree
[Chorus]
She's been everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
[Bridge]
Everyone else's girl
(Everyone else's girl)
Maybe one day she'll be her own
(One day she'll be her own)
Everyone else's girl
(Rushin' rivers thread so thin, limitation)
Maybe one day she'll be her own
(Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue)
Oh, everyone else's girl
(And the drugstore's too safe)
Maybe one day she'll be her own
(In their coats and in their do's)
Oh, everyone else's girl
(Yeah, smother in our hearts, a pillow to my dots)
Maybe one day, maybe one day
One day she'll be her own[Verse 3]
And in the mist, there she rides
And castles are burning in my heart
And as I twist I hold tight
And I ride to work every morning wondering why
"Sit in the chair and be good now"
And become all that they told you
The white coats enter her room and I'm calling my baby
Calling my baby, calling my baby, calling
[Chorus]
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
