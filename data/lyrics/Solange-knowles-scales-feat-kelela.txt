Candy red things gonna spin
With that big body, boy, you're bound to win
And that armor in your mouth
You're gonna shine
Your wrist talking, boy, it's only time
Put the incense on
Cover up the smell
And if your boys go down, I know you'll never tell
You're a superstar
You're a superstar
Always shining in the night
And your skin glowing in the moonlight
The streets say you're a king
The world says you're a failure
And your mother is a queen
But damn she always tells ya
"You gon' end up like your daddy"
But damn that nigga fresh
So if it all comes out to plan
You gon' end up like the best."
You say, "Look on the TV... they all want to be me."
For nothing, whatever it's worth, it's something
Ain't no apologizing, for all of the things you want
So if dreams only go so far
They'll come to where you are

Candy red things gonna spin
With that big body, boy, you're bound to win
And that armor in your mouth
You're gonna shine
Your wrist talking, boy, it's only time
Put the incense on
Cover up the smell
And if your boys go down, I know you'll never tell
You're a superstar
You're a superstar
Always shining in the night
And your skin glowing in the moonlight
Your love is kind
Your love is kind
But your love ain't blind
Your world is kind
Your world is kind
But your world ain't blind
