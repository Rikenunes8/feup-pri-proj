[Verse 1]
5 am, Friday morning
Thursday night, far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction
Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I wanna live
Got a full tank and some chips
[Chorus]
It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
And I sang "holy holy"
As he buttoned down his pants
[Verse 2]
You can laugh, it's kind of funny
Things you think at times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
Yes I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread
For you, your friends
Your father, Mr. Ed?
[Chorus]
Was me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
[Bridge]
And I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back
Used to hang and he said
"It's your choice babe, just remember
I don't think you'll be back
In 3 days time, so you choose well"
Tell me what's right, is it my right
To be on my stomach of Fred's Seville[Chorus]
Was me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
[Verse 3]
And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet?
These things go through your head
When there's a man on your back
And you're pushed flat on your stomach
It's not a classic Cadillac
[Chorus]
Me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
[Outro]
I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
