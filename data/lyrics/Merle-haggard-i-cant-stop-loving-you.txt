I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you and it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago still make me blue
They say the time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you, so I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
