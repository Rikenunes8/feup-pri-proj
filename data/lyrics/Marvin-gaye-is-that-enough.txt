Whoa, I was a fool from the start
Fooling around with my mind instead of my heart
I was young and fine and you plucked me clean
Oh but you didn't know that, I didn't know that
You didn't know what I mean
You know, you had a brother who thought he was cool
But really, I was a dumb little fool
You said you'd never, never go away
And stay beside me night and day
You said you would love and obey
Well, you should, well, you should
Now, it can only get you good
I was a dumb little fool
I was a dumb little fool
But I'll never get enough, get enough
Enough of that funky stuff
I'm gonna jump back in
Up to my neck again
You always knew that I
Wasn't that kind of guy
All the times I thought you knew
Well, I was busy loving you
What was you afraid to lose
Everybody's got to choose
I don't know if I'm
Gonna get a yea or nay
Or if I'm gonna do
What his honor say
(Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous
Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous)
But if I decide, baby, what you want
I wanna know if you would be satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Would you be satisfied
SatisfiedIs that enough, baby
Is that enough
Last you a lifetime
Is that enough
Is that enough
Keep you happy
Is that enough
You know I do it
And I know that you just love that expensive stuff
You got a flair for style
And the style is all the while
What could I do
The judge said she got to keep on living the way she accustomed to
She trying to break a man
I don't understand
Somebody tell me please, tell me please
Why do I have to pay attorney fees (My baby's)
Attorney fees (Ooh baby)
This is a joke
I need a smoke
Wait a minute
