Hey Jimmy, where you going?
I don't know where I'm going
My Dad died, and, uh, he left me his degrees
My mom would always say, "Dad, why don't you work?"
But he just kept learning, hmm
All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school
And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school!
Even, he was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
And now, I'm just glad he left me these
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have
These are documented, my father left them to me
And I'm going to leave them to my kids
I'm gonna learn too
I'm gonna get super smart, so I, too, can die without money
But I'll be the smartest dead guy!
Who has that?
