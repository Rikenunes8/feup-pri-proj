(i had to pull out one of my accents for this...)

Shawty knows I'm the best, I stay wining
Ja won't play if  me wake you in the morning
When Me pull up just be ready for me loving
I been thinking about you, you slow grinding on me
Just cop that exotic
Bout to take to your bitch then see in la maniana
Im bout to kill them skeptics
Now I my worth and me won't settle for just dollars
I need a thrown and my own lane
Unik Nation need an island
And i won't stop working till me dream come thru
This not just for me
This for me & you
(with Bob Marley in me system
Im singing bodmon songs like confessions...my confession) x2
(This a rude boi confession
But This the song me a feel like i could sing...yeah) x2

When i come for what you own me
I  won't do sympathy, just fuck you you pay me
Me make no time for lies and jealousy
So I'm not sorry & I won't make no apologies
Bodmon confession
From Bei UNIK no usher Raymond
Haiti where I came from
Rude boi born kings yet we from bottom
(This like confessions
But my confessions mana sing ya) x2

(with Bob Marley in me system
Im singing bodmon songs like confessions...my confession) x2
(This a rude boi confession
But This the song me a feel like i could sing...yeah) x2
