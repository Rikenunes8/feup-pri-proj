"Thank you very much. This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom Prison. And last night was the first time I ever sung this song. Anyway, this song was written by our friend Glenn Shirley, and... (applause) I hope I do your song justice, Glenn. We'll do our best..."

Chorus
]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free
[Verse 1]
There's a grey stone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the soul of many lost men
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the house of God is never locked
[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free
[Verse 2]
There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I've got down on my knees in that grey stone chapel
And I've thanked the Lord for helping me each day
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's given me the strength to carry on
[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free
