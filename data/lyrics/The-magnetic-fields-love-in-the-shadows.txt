[Verse 1]
The woman with no nose
I know where she goes
The old guy with the gold eye
We go back, he and I
Don't smile
We don't do that here, baby
[Chorus]
Love in the shadows
Was never hard to find
But sometimes the moonglow
Plays tricks on your mind
Love in the shadows is the only kind
[Verse 2]
The whispers you hear
Are not sweet nothings
Let's have one more beer
And I'll tell you something
Don't laugh–I think you're beautiful
[Chorus]
Love in the shadows
Was never hard to find
But sometimes the moonglow
Plays tricks on your mind
Love in the shadows is the only kind
