[Verse 1]
Sing, bird of prey
Beauty begins at the foot of you
Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit
[Chorus]
Even Siberia goes through the motions
Hold out and hold up
Hold down the window (Outboard, river)
Hold out the morning that comes into view (Bluetail, tailfly)
River running right on over my head
[Verse 2]
How does she sing?
Who holds the ring?
And ring and you will find me coming
Cold reigning king
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement
[Chorus]
Even Siberia goes through the motions
Hold out and hold up
Hold down the window (Outboard, river)
Hold out the morning that comes into view (Bluetail, tailfly)
River running right on over the[Refrain]

[Bridge]
Hold down the window
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Warm side, the tower
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru
[Verse 3]
Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit
Cold reigning king
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce their movement

River running right on over then over my head
Outboard, river
Bluetail, tailfly

June cast, moon fast
As one changes
Heart gold, leaver
Soul mark, mover
Christian, changer
Called out, saviour
