[Spoken Intro: Russ Tamblyn]
You want to live in this lousy world?
You want to live in this lousy world?
You want to live in this lousy world?
[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere
[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care
[Chorus 1: Neil Tennant]
Some day, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
Someday
Somewhere
[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
[Chorus 2: Neil Tennant]
Somehow, some day
Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
[Chorus 2: Neil Tennant]
Somehow, some day
Somewhere
[Outro: Neil Tennant]
I feel pretty, oh so pretty
I feel pretty, oh so pretty
