Your western homes are locked forever
The new frontier is not that near
Magnetic screens that fold in backward
Will only bring you years of fear
This is what I always wanted
A new home with a place to breathe
Bring your congregation someday
And you will never
Never see what I want
I can't see what I want
I can't see what I want
I can't see what I want
What I want, can't see
