You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story now

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling yeah
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Ya know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)

Oh I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright

Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
We're rolling, said we're rolling, we're rolling on the river
I'll tell ya we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright
Yeah
Ooo yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooo

If you come down to the river
I bet you going to find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
And we're rolling, and we're rolling, and we're rolling on the river
Tell me one more time rolling, (Yeah)
Rolling, rolling on the river (All right, ooo yeah)

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Yeah
Alright
