[Verse 1]
My girl's got a big mouth
With which she blabbers a lot
She laughs at most everything
Whether it's funny or not
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
[Chorus]
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
[Verse 2]
My girl's got eyeballs
In the back of her head
She looks around and around
You know, it makes me sad to see her like that
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Please don't believe her, she says that for anyone
And if you see her, tell her it's a hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else[Post-Chorus]
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
[Bridge]
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
And if you watch her go, watch her go
Watch her, watch her, watch her, watch her
[Chorus]
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else, no one else, yeah
