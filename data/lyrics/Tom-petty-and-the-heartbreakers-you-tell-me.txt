[Verse 1]
Baby, I heard thunder
I woke up, middle of the night
Baby, I saw fire
I went left, I went right
[Chorus]
So you tell me what you want me to do
This might be over, honey, it ain't through
Let me know when you're finished with me
What you want me to be
Baby, you tell me
Honey, you tell me
[Verse 2]
Baby I don't understand this
But that's all right, I can take a little pain
I've been winning and losing
Baby, I've been in and out of the rain
[Chorus]
So you tell me what you want me to do
This might be over, honey, it ain't through
Let me know when you're finished with me
What you want me to be
Baby, you tell me
Honey, you tell me
[Bridge]
Well you put me through your paces and your twists
Until I felt like dying, I, I
Yeah, the last thing that I needed
Was to finally realize that you were lying, I, I
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
So you tell me what you want me to do
This might be over, honey, it ain't through
Let me know when you're finished with me
What you want me to be
Baby, you tell me
Honey, you tell me[Outro]
Baby, you tell me
Will you tell me?
Oh!
