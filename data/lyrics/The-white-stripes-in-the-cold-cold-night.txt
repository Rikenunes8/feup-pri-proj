[Verse 1]
I saw you standing in the corner
On the edge of a burning light
I saw you standing in the corner
[Chorus]
Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
[Verse 2]
You make me feel a little older
Like a full grown woman might
But when you're gone I grow colder
[Chorus]
Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
[Bridge]
I hear you walking by my front door
I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
I don't care what other people say
I'm going to love you, anyway
[Chorus]
Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night[Verse 3]
I can't stand it any longer
I need the fuel to make my fire bright
So don't fight it any longer
[Chorus]
Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
[Outro]
And I know that you feel it too
When my skin turns into glue
You will know that it's warm inside
And you'll come run to me
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
