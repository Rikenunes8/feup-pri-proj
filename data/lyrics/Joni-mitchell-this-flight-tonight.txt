[Verse 1]
Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
[Verse 2]
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one that you can wish upon
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors
[Chorus]
Oh, star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
[Verse 3]
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you, baby, I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
[Verse 4]
Up there's the heavens, down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on, light the candle in this poor heart of mine
[Chorus]
Oh, star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
[Verse 5]
I'm drinking sweet champagne
, got the 
headphones up high
Can't numb you out, can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing "Goodbye, baby, baby, goodbye
Ooh ooh, love is blind"[Verse 6]
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on, baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again, baby
[Chorus]
Star bright, star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
Shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
