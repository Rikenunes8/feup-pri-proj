Rio Grande, Rio Grande
I'd swim you but I can't
Late at night, flickering fire
Keeps me warm and safe from harm
Little man understands
The Indian's upperhand
Never stray
Always travel in groups of ten
Cherokee trail (trail)

I'm ridin' you all alone
Cherokee trail (trail)

I can't find my way back home
Oh the great big river
Rolls on and on
Oh the great big river
Makes my heart beat strongYeah the great big river
Rolls on and on
And the great big river
Makes my heart beat strong
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on
