[Intro: Frank Black]
This is a song for Carol!
[Verse 1: Frank Black]
You were working Japanese fast food
And I dropped you off with your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
[Pre-Chorus: Frank Black and Kim Deal]
You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That tastes a bit like everyone
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
[Chorus: Frank Black and Kim Deal]
Your bone's got a little machine
(Aaaah!)
You're the bone machine
(Aaaah!)
[Verse 2: Frank Black]
I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda, he bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep, yep, yep!
[Pre-Chorus: Frank Black and Kim Deal]
I make you pray, you make me hard
Your Irish skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard
[Chorus: Frank Black and Kim Deal]
Your bone's got a little machine
(Aaaah!)
You're the bone machine
[Pre-Chorus: Frank Black and Kim Deal]
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh![Outro: Frank Black and Kim Deal]
Your bone's got a little machine
