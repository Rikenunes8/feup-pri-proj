[Verse 1]
Every time I'm walking all down the street
Some pretty mama start breaking down on me
Stop breaking down
Baby, please, stop breaking down
Stuff is going to bust your brains out, baby
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind
[Verse 2]
You Saturday night women, now, you just ape and clown
You don't do nothing but tear my reputation down
Stop breaking down
Mama, please, stop breaking down
Stuff is going to bust your brains out, baby
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind
Alright, alright
[Verse 3]
I love my baby ninety nine degrees
But that mama got a pistol, laid it down on me
Stop breaking down
Baby, please, stop breaking down
Stuff is going to bust your brains out, baby
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind
[Verse 1]
Every time I'm walking all down the street
Some pretty woman start breaking down on me
Stop breaking down
Mama, please, stop breaking down
Shit is gonna bust your brains out, baby
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind
