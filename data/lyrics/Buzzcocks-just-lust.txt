[Verse 1]
There's bed in your eyes, but there's nothing there to trust
Just lust, just lust
You're telling me lies when you say that it's a must
Just lust, just lust
[Chorus 1]
You shattered all my dreams and my head's about to bust
Is it all real? That's how it seems, but it all comes down to dust
[Verse 2]
Your hands feel a need, I don't know if it's too much
Just lust, just lust
It seems it's only greed to taste all that you touch
Just lust, just lust
[Chorus 1]
You shattered all my dreams and my head's about to bust
Is it all real? That's how it seems, but it all comes down to dust
[Verse 3]
You're driven to possess, it hurts, it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing matters less, then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust
[Chorus 2]
I was slow to catch on, and that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion, then emotion is a curse
[Interlude]
[Chorus 2]
I was slow to catch on, and that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion, then emotion is a curse
[Verse 4]
You're driven to possess, it hurts, it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing mattered less, then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust[Outro]
It's my imagination to see things as I choose
Love has a reputation that it can only lose
