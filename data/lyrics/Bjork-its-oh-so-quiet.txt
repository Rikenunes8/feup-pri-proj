[Intro]
Shh, shh
[Verse 1]
It's oh, so quiet, shh, shh
It's oh, so still, shh, shh
You're all alone, shh, shh
And so peaceful until
[Chorus 1]
You fall in love, zing boom
The sky up above, zing boom
Is caving in, wow bam!
[Bridge 1]
You've never been so nuts about a guy
You wanna laugh, you wanna cry
You cross your heart and hope to die
[Verse 2]
Till it's over, and then, shh, shh
It's nice and quiet, shh, shh
But soon again, shh, shh
Starts another big riot
[Chorus 2]
You blow a fuse, zing boom
The devil cuts loose, zing boom
So what's the use, wow, bam!
Of falling in love?
[Verse 3]
It's oh, so quiet
It's oh, so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until
[Chorus 3]
You ring the bell, bim bam
You shout and you yell, hi ho-ho
You broke the spell[Bridge 2]
Gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
This guy is “gorge” and I got hit
There's no mistake, this is it!
[Verse 4]
Till it's over, and then
It's nice and quiet, shh, shh
But soon again, shh, shh
Starts another big riot
[Chorus 2]
You blow a fuse, zing boom
The devil cuts loose, zing boom
So what's the use, wow, bam!
Of falling in love?
[Outro]
The sky caves in
The devil cuts loose
You blow, blow, blow
Blow, blow your fuse, ahh!
When you fall in love
Shh
