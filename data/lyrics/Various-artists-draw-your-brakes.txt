Stop that train I want to get on
My baby she's leaving me now
(Did you hear that? Express yourself brother!)
Stop that train I want to get on
My baby she's leaving me now
Ooh, and she really first on the train towards another guy
And I really couldn't believe that she's gone
And she was telling a lie
Wah! Oooh, good God
And I tell you that the girl has really left I to cry
When she waved bye bye bye
Good gracious!

Stop that train I want to get on
(Draw your brakes brother, I just can't take it
Oooh, 'cause the girl is really gone)
Stop that train (wah!) I want to get on
(Ooh, ooh, and the girl is gone for true
Goodness gracious!)

La la la la la, la la la la la la (ooh, ooh)

La la la la la, la la la la la la (hook riddim, slide down rocks, wah!)

Ooh, play your guitar brother
'Cause this is indeed a sad, sad song
She said she was going on the morning train, uh-huh
And all know I don't see she first or talk to her yet
That mean that the other guy forward away with her
And I just can't take it no more
Stop that train
(Hear I express I-self, draw your brakes brother!
'Cause you really taking I girl away from I)
Stop that train, I want to get on
(Ooh, ooh, I can't even hold on to the back of the train
The brother is going too fast for I)
Stop that train, I want to get on

(And now I am crying)
Stop that train, I want to get on
(And I didn't know that the girl was lying)
La la la la la, la la la la la la
