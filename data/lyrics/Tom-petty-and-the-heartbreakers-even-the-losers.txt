[Intro: Marcie Campbell]
It's just the normal noises in here!
[Verse 1]
Well, it was nearly summer, we sat on your roof
Yeah, we smoked cigarettes, and we stared at the moon
And I showed you stars you never could see
It couldn't have been that easy to forget about me
Baby, time meant nothing, anything seemed real
Yeah, you could kiss like fire, and you made me feel
Like every word you said was meant to be
But it couldn't been that easy to forget about me
[Chorus]
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
They get lucky sometimes
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Two cars park on the overpass
Rocks hit the water like broken glass
I shoulda known right then it was too good to last
God, it's such a drag when you're living in the past
[Chorus]
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
They get lucky sometimes
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
Yeah, they get lucky sometimes[Outro]
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Oh, oh!
Oh!
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
