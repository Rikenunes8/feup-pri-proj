[Intro]
Yeah, smash on the radio, bet I penned it!
Britney (Break me off)
Oh, toy soldier
Britney (Break me off)
Oh, toy soldier
Britney (Break me off)
Oh, toy soldier
Britney (Break me off)
Oh, toy soldier
[Verse 1]
I'm out the door, it's automatic, simple, babe
(Why you wanna do that to me?)
I'm like a fire, bottle busting in your face
(Why you wanna do that to me?)
So tired of you being up in my space
(What you gonna do with that?)
How much more could I take?
I'm tired of privates driving
Need a general that ainâ€™t weak
[Pre-Chorus]
When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew
The type of fun I'm getting into
Peek-a-boo, he good
Doing things you wish you could
He's not talking, he's just walking
Like them city boys from New York
[Chorus]
This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
(I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over[Post-Chorus]
I don't want no more (Break me off)
Oh, toy soldiers
I'm simply sick and tired of those
Oh, toy soldiers
I don't want no more
Oh, toy soldiers
I'm simply sick and tired of those
Oh, toy soldiers
[Verse 2]
I want it more than ever now
I realized that they ain't listening
Like a princess supposed to get it
That's why I'm dusting off my fitted
Coming back looking delicious
Yes, I know they wanna kiss me
Now I hold them at attention
'Cause new Britney's on a mission
[Pre-Chorus]
When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew
The type of fun I'm getting into
Peek-a-boo, he good
Doing things you wish you could
He's not talking, he's just walking
Like them city boys from New York[Chorus]
This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
(I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over
[Bridge]
Brit, I heard that he was saying he's still in love with you, and
(Brit, I heard he said you could stay if you wanted to, and)
Brit, I heard every man out here is wanting you now
Brit, I heard, I heard, what you gonna do now?
[Chorus]
This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
(I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over
[Outro]
(I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over
Coming over
Coming over
(I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over
