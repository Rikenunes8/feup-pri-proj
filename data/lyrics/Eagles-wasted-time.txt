[Verse 1]
Well, baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end
[Verse 2]
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember, oh
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
[Chorus 1]
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
[Verse 3]
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell, fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No, no, you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell
[Verse 4]
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To let them go away
[Chorus 2]
And I could've done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worryin' 'bout this wasted time[Verse 5]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Another love has come and gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
"Sometimes to keep it together
We've got to leave it alone"
[Chorus 3]
So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time
