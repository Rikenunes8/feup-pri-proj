[Verse 1]
See you watching me like a hawk
I don't mind the way you talk
But if you touch me something's got to give
I live the life I love and I love the life I live
[Verse 2]
So if you see me and think I'm wrong
Don't worry 'bout me, just let me 'lone
My sweet life ain't nothing but a thrill
I live the life I love and I love the life I live
[Verse 3]
My diamond ring and my money, too
Tomorrow night they may belong to you
These girls move me at their will
I live the life I love and I love the life I live
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I may bet a thousand on a bet this time
One minute later, I can't cover your dime
Tomorrow night I could be over the hill
I just want you to know, baby, the way I feel[Verse 4]
Oh, walkin' when you pass you by
Don't talk about me because I could be high
Please forgive me if you will
I live the life I love and I love the life I live
