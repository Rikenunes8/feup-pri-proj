[Verse 1]
Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I start bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong
[Verse 2]
I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm bangin' on my boogie
[Chorus: Manu Chao, 
Anouk
]
I'm the
(King of 
the bongo, king of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the bongo
King of the bongo bong)
[Verse 3]
Nobody like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of bongo baby, I'm the king of bongo bong
[Chorus: Manu Chao, 
Anouk
]
King of the bongo
King of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo
King of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come
[Verse 4]
They say that I'm a clown
Making too much dirty sound
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie[Chorus: Manu Chao, 
Anouk
]
I'm the
(King of 
the bongo, king of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the bongo
King of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come
[Verse 5]
Bangin' on my bongo, all that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me
I'm a king without a crown hangin' loose in a big town
I'm the king of bongo baby I'm the king of bongo bong
[Chorus: Manu Chao, 
Anouk
]
(King of the bongo
(King of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong))
Hear me when I come
[Verse 1]
Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I start bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong[Outro]
Hear me when I come
Hear me when I come
Hear me when I
