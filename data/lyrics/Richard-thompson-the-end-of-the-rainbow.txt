[Verse 1]
I feel for you, you little horror
Safe at your mother's breast
No lucky break for you around the corner
'Cause your father is a bully
And he thinks that you're a pest
And your sister, she's no better than a whore
[Chorus]
Oh life seems so rosy in the cradle
But I'll be a friend, I'll tell you what's in store
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow
There's nothing to grow up for anymore
[Verse 2]
Tycoons and barrow boys will rob you
And throw you on the side
And all because they love themselves sincerely
And the man holds a bread knife
Up to your throat is four feet wide
And he's anxious just to show you what it's for
[Chorus]
Your mother works so hard to make you happy
But take a look outside the nursery door
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow
There's nothing to grow up for anymore
[Verse 3]
And all the sad and empty faces
That pass you on the street
All running in their sleep, all in a dream
And every loving handshake
Is just another man to beat
How your heart aches just to cut him to the core
[Chorus]
Life seems so rosy in the cradle
But I'll be a friend, I'll tell you what's in store
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow
There's nothing to grow up for anymore
