[Verse 1]
I pulled out for San Anton’
I never felt so good
My woman said she’d meet me there
And of course, I knew she would
The coachman, he hit me for my hook
And he asked me my name
I give it to him right away
Then I hung my head in shame
[Chorus]
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold
Get me outa here, my dear man!
[Verse 2]
I come into Pittsburgh
At six-thirty flat
I found myself a vacant seat
An’ I put down my hat
“What’s the matter, Molly, dear
What’s the matter with your mound?”
“What’s it to ya, Moby Dick?
This is chicken town!”
[Chorus]
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold
Get me outa here, my dear man!
[Verse 3]
I bought my girl
A herd of moose
One she could call her own
Well, she came out the very next day
To see where they had flown
I’m going down to Tennessee
Get me a truck or something
Gonna save my money and rip it up!
[Chorus]
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold
Get me outa here, my dear man![Verse 4]
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel
And boys, I sure was slick
I come in like a ton of bricks
Laid a few tricks on them
Going’ back to Pittsburgh
Count up to thirty
Round that horn and ride that herd
Gonna thread up!
[Chorus]
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking’ for my lo and behold
Get me outa here, my dear man!
