Well, I had me a woman, couldn't be true
She made me for my money and she made me blue
A man needs a woman he can lean on
But my leanin' post is done left and gone
She's long gone now, lonesome blue
Well, she told me on a Sunday she was checkin' me out
Here it is Tuesday, she's nowhere about
Man needs a woman that he can lean on
But my leanin' post is done left and gone
Yes, she's long gone now, lonesome blue
Yeah, she told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out
Here it is Monday, she's nowhere about
A man needs a woman he can lean on
But my leanin' post is done left and gone
She's long gone now, I'm lonesome blue
