[Verse 1]
You made your major overtures
When you were a sure and orotund mutt
And I was still a dewey petal
Rather than a moribund slut
My love wrecked you
You packed to twirl your skirt at the palace
It hurt more than it ought to hurt
I went to work to cultivate a callus
[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow
[Chorus]
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left alone?
[Verse 2]
Oh, when I try to love
And I can love the same man in the same bed in the same city
But not in the same room, it's a pity, but
Oh, it never bothered me before
Not 'til this guy, what a guy, oh God what a good guy
And I can't even enjoy him[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow
[Chorus]
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
Alone?
Alone?
Alone?
[Verse 3]
My ills are reticulate
My woes are granular
The ants weigh more than the elephants
Nothing, nothing is manageable
So couldn't we skip the valedictories?
I can see a door there
Shut it and forget my number
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow[Chorus]
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left alone?
