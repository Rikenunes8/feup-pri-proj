[Verse]
We used to laugh a lot
We never cried
But things are all different now
Since your sweet love has died
[Chorus]
Seems we've lost the way to find
All the good times we found before
Yeah, we used to laugh a lot
Things aren't funny anymore
[Verse 2]
If I knew how to change your mind
Maybe things could be right again
If I could turn back one page of time
Before love came to an end
[Chorus 2]
I'd know just where to turn
To turn it all on once more
Maybe we laughed too soon
Things aren't funny anymore
[Chorus 2]
I'd know just where to turn
To turn it all on once more
Maybe we laughed too soon
Things aren't funny anymore
