[Chorus]
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but...
[Verse 1]
Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears, I'm wondering
If I have to do without you
But there's no reason why
I fell asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin' my arms are yours
I want no one but you
[Chorus]
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but...
[Verse 2]
I still remember to the day
In fact it was a third Monday
You came along to be the one for me
And now I'm alone
I'm sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I have
The chance to beg you to stay
I want no one but you
[Chorus]
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but...[Breakdown]
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
You know that I know that I get so lonely thinking of you
[Chorus]
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
