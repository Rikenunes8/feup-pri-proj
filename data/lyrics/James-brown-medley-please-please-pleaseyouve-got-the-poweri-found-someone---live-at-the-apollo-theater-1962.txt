Please, please, please, please
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
Oh, oh, I need you, darling
You've got the power of love
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I found someone to love me
I know it's true
I love you
I found someone to love me
Why did it happen this way?
Someone has taken my place
No one to share my embracе
Oh, why do you do me like you do?
I love you, yеs I do
I love you, yes I do
I know your love is true
From the way I looked at you
You love me yes, you do
You need me, I need you
I'm yours my whole life through
Since I first laid eyes on you
I guess you knew it from the start
From the day you took my heart
You're the one girl I'll always admire
I must be whenever you are
But I want to let you know one thing
I want to tell you one thing
I want to tell you one thing
I was walking down the streets
Why just everything happen to me
Why just everything happen to me
Please, I'm lonely
I'm by myself now and the love's a memory
And so many strange things happen to me
All day long
Strange, strange things happen to me
All day long
Please I'm lonely, everything I
Everything I do is wrong
Bewildered
Love, I dream of you
Well, I love, I need you
Why did we part?
Baby, take my hand (Please don't go)
I want to be a better man (please, please, don't go)
Honey, please (don't go)
I love you so (please, please, don't go)
Please don't go (please, please, don't go)
Please don't go (please, please, don't go)
Honey please don't go (don't go)
I love you so (please, please, don't go)
