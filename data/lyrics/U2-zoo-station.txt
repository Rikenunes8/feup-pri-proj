[Verse 1]
I'm ready
Ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
Ready for what's next
Ready to duck
Ready to dive
Ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
Ready for the push
[Pre-Chorus]
In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around
On my hands and knees
[Chorus]
She's just down the line ... Zoo Station
Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station
[Verse 2]
I'm ready
Ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street
Ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go
Of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush
[Bridge]
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright ... it's alright ... it's alright ... it's alright
Hey baby ... hey baby ... hey baby ... hey baby ...
It's alright
It's alright[Verse 3]
Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass
[Outro]
I'm just down the line from your love ... Zoo Station
Under the sign of your love ... Zoo Station
I'm gonna be there ... Zoo Station
Tracing the line ... Zoo Station
I'm gonna make it on time ... make it on time ... Zoo Station
Just two stops down the line ... Zoo Station
Just a stop down the line ... Zoo Station
