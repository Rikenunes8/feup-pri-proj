[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!
[Verse 1: Eddie, 
Dennis
]
People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learnin'
But the teacher
[Pre-Chorus: Dennis]
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation
[Chorus]
Ball of confusion
Oh, yeah
That's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
[Verse 2: Paul, 
Dennis
, 
Melvin
]
The sale of pills are at an all-time high
Young folks walkin' 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh, the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, 
gun control
, the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon
, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
[Pre-Chorus]
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows
[Chorus]
Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey[Verse 3]
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction
, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand
, 
population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on
[Chorus]
Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
It's a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey (Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya)
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today
