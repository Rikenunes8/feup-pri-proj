[Verse 1: Elizabeth Fraser]
You're not my eater
I'm not your food
[Chorus: Elizabeth Fraser]
Love you for God
Love you for the Mother
[Verse 2: Elizabeth Fraser]
Eat me in the space
Within my heart
[Chorus: Elizabeth Fraser]
Love you for God
I love you for the Mother
[Verse 3: Elizabeth Fraser]
Mother fountain
Or live or not at all
[Verse 4: Elizabeth Fraser]
The most level
Sunken chapel
[Chorus: Elizabeth Fraser]
Love you for God
Oh, love you for the Mother
[Verse 5: Elizabeth Fraser]
All's there to love
Only love
