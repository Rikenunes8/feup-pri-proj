[Verse 1]
Oh, southern breeze knock me to my knees

The religious and the rest, they've all tried their best
Well I guess some things you just don't understand
[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, when will the road run out
I'm on the road but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why, still I second guess my pace
If I stand to lose from winning
To find the truth I'm willing
To start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days
[Verse 2]
Oh, southern pines reaching for the sky
I'm convinced that I can fly beneath your shade
Oh, and its all overdue spending time just me and you
Mmm, the pulpit and pew where I was saved
[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, when will the road run out
I'm on the road but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why, still I second guess my pace
If I stand to lose from winning
To find the truth I'm willing
To start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, when will the road run out
I'm on the road but I'm in doubt
And I don't know why, still I second guess my pace
If I stand to lose from winning
To find the truth I'm willing
To start back at the beginning of the good ol' days
The good ol' days
[Outro]
Oh, southern breeze knock me to my knees
I believe you're the only one who can
