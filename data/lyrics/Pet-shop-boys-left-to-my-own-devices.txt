House
House
[Interlude]
[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
I get out of bed at half past ten
Phone up a friend who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping
[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
One day I'll read or learn to drive a car
If you pass the test you can beat the rest
But I don't like to compete or talk street, street, street
I can pick up the best from the party animal
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
Pick up a brochure about the sun
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw
I was always told that you should join a club
Stick with the gang if you want to belong
[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
In a world of my own at the back of the garden
I didn't want to compete or play out on the street
For in a secret life I was a roundhead general
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
Oh, I would[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
I was faced with a choice at a difficult age
Would I write a book or should I take to the stage?
But in the back of my head I heard distant feet
Ché Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat
[Verse 5: Neil Tennant]
It's not a crime when you look the way you do
The way I like to picture you
When I get home it's late at night
I pour a drink and watch the fight
[Verse 6: Neil Tennant]
Turn off the TV, look at a book
Pick up the phone, fix some food
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day
Waiting for the minute I hear you say
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Come on, baby, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
Come on, baby
Left to my own devices, I probably would[Interlude]
[Verse 7: Neil Tennant]
Out of bed at half past ten
The party animal phones a friend
Picks up news about the sun
And the working day has just begun
[Interlude]
[Verse 8: Neil Tennant]
Sticks with the gang at the back of the street
Pass the test and you don't compete
[Verse 9: Neil Tennant]
Drive the car if you're with me
Ché Guevara's drinking tea
He reads about a new device
And takes to the stage in a secret life
[Interlude]
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Left to my own devices, I probably would
If I was left to my own devices, I possibly would
If I was left to my own devices, I probably would
If I was left to my own devices, I probably would
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
[Outro: Neil Tennant]
Come on, baby
Left to my own devices, I probably would
