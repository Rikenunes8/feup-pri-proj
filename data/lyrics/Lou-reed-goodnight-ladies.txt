[Verse 1]
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye, let me tell you now
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye
[Bridge 1]
Now, all night long
You've been drinking your tequila
But now you've sucked your lemon peel dry
So why not get high, high, high and
Goodnight ladies
Ladies goodnight
[Verse 2]
Goodnight ladies, ah, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye
Goodnight sweet ladies, ah, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye, bye-bye
[Bridge 2]
Ah, we've been together for the longest time
But now it's time to get high
Come on, let's get high, high, high
And goodnight ladies
Ladies goodnight
[Verse 3]
Oh, I'm still missing my other half
Oh, it must be something I did in the past
Don't it just make you wanna laugh
It's a lonely Saturday night
[Verse 4]
Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone
I put another record on my stereo
But I'm still singing a song of you
It's a lonely Saturday night
[Bridge 3]
Now, if I was an actor
Or a dancer who is glamorous
Then, you know, an amorous life would soon be mine
But now the tinsel light of star break
Is all that's left to applaud my heart break
And at eleven o'clock I watch the network news[Verse 5]
Oh, woh, woh, something tells me that you're really gone
You said we could be friends
But that's not what I want
Ah, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done
It's a lonely Saturday night
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night
One more once, it's a lonely Saturday night
