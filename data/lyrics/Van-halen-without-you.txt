[Verse 1]
Hey you, wake up, get yourself together
Yeah you, so you think you made it better
'Cause you know it's coming at you while your back is turned
Look too long and I can't help you
Clear your head, find a way home, better make up your mind
[Verse 2]
First, you say that you will
Then you say you won't
Well I'm just trying to figure
Try and figure you out
[Pre-Chorus]
How long can this go on?
Tell me what is wrong
And maybe there's a way that we can work it out
[Chorus]
There must be some kind of way that we can make it right
But I just can't do it all without you
Without you
[Verse 3]
Hey fool, wise up, better late than never
Yeah you, you know that nothing lasts forever
Nobody ever told you that your time is running out
Too bad and I can't help you
[Pre-Chorus]
How long can this go on?
Tell me what is wrong
And maybe there's a way that we can work it out
[Chorus]
There must be some kind of way that we can make it right
But I just can't do it all without you
Without you[Bridge]
The point I'm trying to make
You got to give more than you take
You gotta give, give more than you take
[Refrain]
Gotta, gotta, gotta work it out
[Chorus]
There must be some kind of way that we can make it right
But I just can't do it all without you
Without you
[Outro]
Find a way
The point I'm trying to make
You got to give more than you take
You gotta give, give more than you take
