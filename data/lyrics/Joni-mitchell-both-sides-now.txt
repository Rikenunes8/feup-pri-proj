[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
[Chorus]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take
, 
and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day
[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
 
at all
[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
