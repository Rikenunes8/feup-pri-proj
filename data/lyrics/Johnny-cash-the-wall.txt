There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Namin' their wedding day
Namin' their wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide
