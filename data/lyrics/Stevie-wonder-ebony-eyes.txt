[Verse 1]
She's a miss beautiful supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's got to be number one
[Chorus]
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
[Verse 2]
She's the sunflower from nature's seed
A girl that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles, it seems the stars all know
'Cause one by one, they start to light up the sky
[Chorus]
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love ya, baby
[Interlude]
Saxophone, right here
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes
[Verse 3]
When she starts talking soft and sweet
Like birds of spring, her words all seem to sing
With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings[Chorus]
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love you, baby
[Interlude]
Saxophone, one more time
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes
[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty Black beauty
Beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
