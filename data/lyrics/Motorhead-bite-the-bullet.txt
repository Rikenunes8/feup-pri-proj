Stepping out, I'm leaving here
No use crying, crying in my beer
Enough's enough, believe it's true
Bite the bullet
I'm leaving you
I said goodbye, I left a note
But I don't remember what I wrote
The same old words
To say we're through
Bite the bullet
I'm leaving you
You know that's the way it always ends
Get sympathy from all your friends
Seems there's nothing
Nothing else to do
Bite the bullet
I'm leaving you
