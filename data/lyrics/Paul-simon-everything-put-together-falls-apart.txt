[Verse 1]
Paraphernalia never hides your broken bones
And I don't know why
You'd want to try
It's plain to see you're on your own
[Bridge 1]
Ooh, 
I ain't blind, no
Some folks are crazy
Others walk that borderline
[Verse 2]
Watch what you're doing
Taking downs to get off to sleep
And ups to start you on your way
After a while they'll change your style
I see it happening every day
[Bridge 2]
Ooh, 
spare your heart
Everything put together
Sooner or later falls apart
[Verse 3]
There's nothing to it, nothing to it
And you can cry and you can lie
For all the good it'll do you, you can die
But when it's done, the police come
And they lay you down for dead
Just remember what I said
