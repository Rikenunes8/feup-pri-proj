You made plans to leave a thousand times, I know
And a thousand times I should have let you go
But each time, I'd always beg you back somehow
If I'd left it up to you, it'd all be over now
It'd all be over now except the crying
I'd be used to spending all my nights alone
Wish I'd found a way to let you go somehow
If I'd left it up to you, it'd all be over now
It'd all be over now except the crying
I'd be used to spending all my nights alone
Wish I'd found a way to let you go somehow
If I'd left it up to you, it'd all be over now
