Someone's hanging out
We can't forget about
Things that people do
When they're free
Like visitors from space
It's hard to find a place
To blend in and go unrecognized
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm standing on the road
My mind outstretched to you
I'm picking something up
I'm letting something go
Like a dog I'm fetching
This to you
Pictures in mind
Rows of poppy fields
Harmony entwined
Changing gear that grinds
Pictures in my mind
Pictures in my brain
Electrical energy
Fighting drugs with pain
There's a war inside
Pictures in my brain
I'm looking for a job
I don't know what I'm doing
My software's
Not compatible with you
But this I can't deny
I know that you can fly
Cause I'm here
On the ground without you
Angel without wings
Owner without things
Sharpshooter without rings
Around you
The road we used to ride
Together side by side
Has flowers pushing
Through the dotted line
