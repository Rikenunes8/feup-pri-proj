Jump Sturdy Jump Sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
(she came, she came...)
People say she used to dance with the fish
Some people say she juggled fire in a dish
Clear day on the Bayou St. John
She raised her hands and caused a 'lectrical storm
She was a treacherous lady
She never met much harm
One day she ducked past the station house
She turned on the fire alarm
Somehow she got tangled up with Queen Julia Jackson
Down on Melpomene and Erato Street
Queen Julia Jackson talked to Zozo LaBrique
And Jump Sturdy died with her soul in defeat
