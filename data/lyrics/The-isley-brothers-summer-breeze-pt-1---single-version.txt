Oh, ah, ah, yeah
Summer breeze, all in my mind
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Summer breeze, all in my mind
No, no, no, no
It's all in my mind
No, no, no, no
It's all in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmines in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmines in my mind
All in my mind
See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Lets me know every, everything's alright
Oh, summer
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmines in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmines my mind
All in my mind
Sweet days of summer, the jasmines in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world
See the smile waiting in the kitchen
Food cooking on a plate for two
Feel the arms reaching out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through
Oh, summer
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmines in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmines in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
