[Verse 1]
I believe if I was all alone
I would be better off in a world my own
I'd forget I ever knew of you
And this dream every night that you put me through
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We walk along a Hollywood sea
And you dance once again with me
[Chorus]
We are close, we are friends
And our love never ends
But in the cold morning light I see
That you won't be back for me
[Verse 2]
The wound you left is healing and then
It starts itching and I scratch it open again
So the pain comes out and I give in
And indulge my imaginations, whims
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We sit and drink Victorian tea
And your face wears a smile for me
[Chorus]
I was yours, you were mine
Our hearts bound, lost in time
But in the cold morning light I see
That you won't be back
[Bridge]
For me there can be no peace
For me there can be no rest
I believe though I've tried my best
I'm condemned it seems
To a life of restlessness and hopeless dreams
[Chorus]
We are close, we are friends
And our love never ends
But in the cold morning light I see
That you won't be back for me
