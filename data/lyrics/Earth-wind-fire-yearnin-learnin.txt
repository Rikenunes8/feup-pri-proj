Stop! Look at what's behind you
Fame and love's gonna find you
We're just here to remind you
Yearn and learn is what you do, oh
Yaow!
Yeah

Once upon a time
Child was born
With the light to carry on
Didn't know what he had to be
Had the feelin' he was
Bound to see
So the streets he fled to shine
In a world of a different kind
As we yearn
So we learn, yeah

Stop! Look at what's behind you
Fame and love's gonna find you
We're just here to remind you
Yearn and learn is what you do, oh

Ha
He just felt so good inside
Watchin' people come alive (haow)
Throbbin' rhythm
Stir your soul
Melody hazy
Do unfold
Give your heart, huh, a special treat (yeah)
Clap your hands, oh, ba-baby
Stomp your feet, y'know
As you yearn, now
So you learn
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Stop! Look what's behind you
Fame and love's gonna find you (yeah, yeah, yeah, haow)
We're just here to remind you
Yearn and learn is what you do

Yeah, yeah, yeah (unintelligible)
Stop! Look what's behind you (la, la, la, la... here it go)
Fame and love's gonna find you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give a sign
We're just here to remind you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What you know?
Yearn and learn is what you do
(Unintelligible)
Play on it, play on it
(Unintelligible)
Play on it
Ay-yee, yeah
