[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
And right about now with this particular time
As we bring this LP to a close
Busta Rhymes and the whole entire Flip Mode squad
Would like to congratulate you all for being such a wonderful audience
And taking the time outta your busy day to day livin’
To do the knowledge
Take in and observe and absorb
And listen and feel the whole emotional roller coaster of this LP
Thoroughly put together by Missy and Timbaland
The official bang shit
Hip-hop music, soul music, R&B music
Y'all motherfuckers don’t know, this is that official full fledge shit
And until the next time, y'all niggas stay safe
Stay aware, and stay tuned
Word is bond and we be back
