[Verse 1]
What if I told you I love you?
What if I court you with rhyme?
In this world there's nothing left
Well, nothing that's new
What if I told you, without you
Loving is simply a lie?
I'm belching blues into the night
Oh, tell me you're mine
Please say it's true
[Chorus]
Oh, shame it's over
I was the last of the days of them all
Well, push me over
I'm flat on my back but I'm having a ball
And just look who's laughing
[Verse 2]
What if I flew like a dove, dear?
What if I wooed you in rhyme?
There's nothing left
Nothing that's good left for me now
Oh, I'll just go and sleep with strangers
I'll live like a lord in a tower
Carouse in the sin, take in too much air
And I can't dream at night
Well, not anymore
[Chorus]
Oh, shame it's over
It's been such fun and we've had a ball
Well, push me over
But I'll be the last of people to fall
Well, just look who's laughing
[Instrumental break][Chorus]
Oh, shame it's over
Howl like a cow bloated on grass
Well, push me over
Me on my back and you on your arse
Such a shame it's all over
There are so few days left to grasp
So push me over
Me on my back and you on your lazy old arse
Well, just look who's laughing
