You talk of sweeties bashful sweeties
I've got one of those
Oh he's handsome as can be
But he worries me
He goes to college
And gathers knowledge
Oo, what that boy knows
He's up in his Latin and Greek
But in his sheikin' he's weak cause
When I want some lovin'
And I gotta have some lovin'
He says please, stop it, please
He's so unusual...
