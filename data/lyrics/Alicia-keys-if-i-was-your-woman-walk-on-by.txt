[Intro]
Yeah Mo Bee, drop it on me
Yeah, let's do it like this
[Verse 1]
If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength to walk out my door
My love would overrule my sense
And I'd call you back for more
[Chorus]
If I was your woman (If I was your woman)
If I was your woman (If I was your woman)
And you were my man, yeah
[Verse 2]
She tears you down, darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up, darling
When she lets you fall
'Cause you're like a diamond (Shining)
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me, you won't ask[Chorus]
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
Here's what I'd do (What would you do?)
I'd never, never, no, no, stop loving you (Yeah, yeah)
Mmm, oh
[Bridge]
Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first, darling
Will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me (Part of me)
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need (I'm what you need)
But I'm too afraid to show it
[Chorus]
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
Here's what I'd do (What would you do?)
I'd never, never, no, no, stop loving you
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
Here's what I'd do (What would you do?)
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Outro]
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
