[Verse 1]
Something old, the time's gone by
Something new, these tears I cry
Something borrowed were those lips my lips knew
And that's why I'm something blue
Something old, the vows we made
Something new, the price I paid
Something borrowed, love was tried but not true
Now my life is something blue
[Chorus]
I guess that I'd better smile
Walking behind you down the aisle
I feel I'm walking to my doom
I'm really not the best man in this room
[Verse 2]
Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two
Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two
[Outro]
And that's why
And that's why I'm something blue
