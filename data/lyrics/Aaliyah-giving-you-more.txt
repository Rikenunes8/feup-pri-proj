[Chorus]
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
[Verse 1]
Let me be your angel, I'm ready
Ready to get on your love
You don't have to worry, I'm ready to do
Yeah, whatever you require, it's my one and only desire
[Pre-Chorus]
Call on me
And you know that I'll be all you need
Oh, come to me
I got what you like, and your love I won't deny
[Chorus]
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
[Verse 2]
Let me be the one, one that you run to
Everything that you're goin' through
And if you feel kind of lonely, you just call me
Any time, any place, anywhere[Chorus]
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
[Bridge]
I'm givin' you more, all the love you need
I'm givin' you more, all the love you need
I'm givin' you more, all the love you need
I'm givin' you more, all the love you need
My love, is right here for you
And I'm down to give you every part of me
Can't you see
[Chorus]
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
All that you need, all that you want
I wanna be the one that's giving you more
[Outro]
All that you need, all that you need
All that you need, everything you get
All that you need, I know what you need
All that you need
All that you need
All that you need
