[Verse 1]
I awoke today and found a frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
And all the trees are shivering in a naked row
I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
[Chorus]
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down
And winter's closing in
[Verse 2]
I had me a man in summertime, he had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town my darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground, bully winds came around
Pushed them face-down in the snow
He got the urge for going and I had to let him go
[Chorus]
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
Summertime was falling down
And winter was closing in
[Verse 3]
Now the warriors of winter, they gave a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out
See the geese in chevron flight
Flapping and racing on before the snow
They got the urge for going and they got the wings so they can go
[Chorus]
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down
And winter's closing in[Verse 4]
I'll ply the fire with kindling now, I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
Have her stay for just another month or so
But she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go
[Chorus]
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in
[Outro]
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down
