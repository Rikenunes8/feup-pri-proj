[Verse 1]
Take a toke of smoke from me as you dream inside
Let your days slip away come with me and ride
My darling, you aren't the average kind
You need the comfort of my lovin'
To bring out the best in you
I hope that you do, uh
See what you've given to me, uh
Separatin', debatin', uh
Stay with me that's all you have to do
[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away, uh
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(Okay) It ain't that easy
(Ow, ow, ow) Ow, ow, ow, ow-ow-ow, yeah
[Verse 2]
Ever hit with a choice that you can't decide?
Direction left or right, mmm
Shut your mouth off and focus on what you feel inside
See y'all know I'ma go with my vibe, uh
You won't believe all the things you have to sacrifice
Just to get peace of mind, oh
And you take what they give as if it did suffice
Still it's just a waste of time
Uh, I offer you the truth
You need the comfort of my lovin' to bring out the best in you
I wanna give you something (I wanna give you)
To feed your mind (To feed your mind)
Separating, don't debate it (Separatin')
Faithfully we'll see this love through[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away, uh
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(Okay) It ain't that easy
(Ow, ow, ow) Ow, ow, ow, ow-ow-ow, yeah
[Bridge]
I got just what you need, babe
All this love you'll receive, yeah, ooh, yeah
I've been waitin' so long on you
Ooh, yeah, aw, huh
[Verse 3]
I tell you this sincerely
I need the comfort of your lovin', uh
To bring out the best in me
I'm gonna keep you (I'm gonna keep you)
Safe from evil opinion
What I give, can't duplicate it
Faithfully we'll see this love through
[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(Okay) It ain't that easy
(Ow, ow, ow) Ow, ow, ow, ow-ow-ow, yeah
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away, yeah
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) Ow-ow-ooh
