Love and hope and sex and dreams are still surviving on the streets
And look at me, I'm in tatters
Shattered
Friends are so alarming, my lover's never charming
Life's just a cocktail party on the street, Big Apple
People dressed in plastic bags
Directing traffic, some kind of fashion
Laughter, joy, and loneliness and sex and sex and sex and sex
And look at me, I'm in tatters
Shattered
All this chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter 'bout
Shmatta, shmatta, shmatta, I can't give it away on 7th Avenue
This town's been wearing tatters, uh-huh
Work and work for love and sex
And ain't you hungry for success, success, success, success
Does it matter?
I'm shattered
Tattered
Shattered
Ahh look at me, I'm tattered, yes
Oh, so shattered, yes
What does it matter?
So tattered
What does it matter?
[Eddie (Jeanne)]
Shadoobie, shattered, shattered (What you say?)
Shadoobie, shattered, shattered (Come again?)
Shadoobie, shattered, shattered
Don't you know the crime rate's going up, up, up, up, up
To live in this town, you must be tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough
You got rats on the west side, bed bugs uptown
What a mess, this town's in tatters, I've been shattered
My brain's been battered, splattered all over Manhattan[Jeanne (Eddie)]
What you say? (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
Raindrops (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
On roses (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
Whiskers (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
On kittens (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
What you say?(Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
Uh-huh (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
This town's full of money grabbers
Go ahead, bite the Big Apple, don't mind the maggots
My friends they come around they
Flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter
Pile it up, pile it up, pile it high on the platter
