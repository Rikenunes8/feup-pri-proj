I told a little lie, baby, I made you cry
That's why I'm feeling blue
I'm feeling sorry, I lied to you
I took your little heart, I tore it all apart
And now I'm missin' you
I'm feeling sorry, I couldn't be true
I should have known better
I should have been truer
I know that you're blue but baby I'm bluer
Now I've got a little heart that's broke all apart
And now I'm wanting you
I'm feeling sorry and missin' you
I put a tear or two in your eyes of blue
I wasted your true love
And now I'm sorry, just a fool in love
You were the one for me but I felt fancy free
That's why I'm hurting so
I'm feeling sorry, I didn't know
You offered me true love but I didn't take it
One way that you forgive me but I'll never make it
Ooh, I hope to find a way, baby, to make you stay
But I know I'll never win
I'm feeling sorry, I'm just a friend
I'm feeling sorry, I'm just a friend
I'm feeling sorry, that I'm just a friend
