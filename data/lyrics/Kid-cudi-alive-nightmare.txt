[Intro]
So mean
So mean
[Chorus]
Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm not myself, I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Ah, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing's right
My skin is burning and my heart begins to speed
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly, ay
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move, mm
I smell her scent, and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey
[Chorus]
Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl while I'm hoping to find some light
You call it Heaven, I do too, we feel the same
Ain't nothing wrong, I'll be feasting on something brave, ay
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, ah
I hope she can find the man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey
[Chorus]
Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na[Verse 3]
I watch the sun collapse and took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf, go where I wanna
Let the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away, the light never left me
Uh, I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light, rather that than the evil
Feelin' out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
Your fate will be
Whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
Won't fight no more
I let these things just be, be, be, be
[Chorus]
Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
