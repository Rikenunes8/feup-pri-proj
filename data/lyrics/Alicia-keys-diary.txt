[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you, ooh
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away, mmm
Ooh baby, if there's anything that you fear (Anything)
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & (Tony! Toni! Toné!)]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
Yeah, mmm, yeah
[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
And only we know what is talked about, baby boy
I don't know how you can be driving me so crazy, boy
Baby, when you're in town, why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me, boy
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & (Tony! Toni! Toné!)]
Oh, I won't tell (No, no, no) your secrets
(I will never, never, never)
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep (I will keep) your secrets (Your)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary[Outro: Alicia Keys & 
Tony! Toni! Toné!
