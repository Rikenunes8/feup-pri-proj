Read out the warning
See how the river flows
Be ready to sail
On Judgment Day

Who knows where God is
Paging through the book of life
Rememberin' crosses every day
Goodbye Christians on the shore
Goodbye Christians on the shore

He'll take a little bird
He'll have the last word
And we'll stand and cheer
When he flies away

Who knows where God is
Paging through the book of life
Rememberin' crosses evеry day

Goodbye Christians on the shore
Goodbyе Christians on the shore

Goodbye Christians on the shore
Goodbye Christians on the shore
