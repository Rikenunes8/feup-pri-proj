[Verse 1]
How can I convince you, it's me I don't like
And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes
When I've always been distant
And I've always told lies for love
[Verse 2]
I'm bound by these choices, so hard to make
I'm bound by the feeling, so easy to fake
None of this is real enough to take me from you
[Chorus]
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you
[Verse 3]
I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say
How can I get closer and be further away
From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie
[Chorus]
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you
[Chorus]
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you
[Outro]
Not about you
Not about you
Not about you
It's not about you
