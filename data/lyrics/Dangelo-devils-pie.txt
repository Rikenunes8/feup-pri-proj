[Chorus]
Mm
Fuck the slice, want the pie
Why ask why 'til we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs, women, wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
[Verse 1]
Who am I to justify
All the evil in our eye
When I myself feel the high
From all that I despise?
Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay in this bed I made
And if I die before I wake
I hope the Lord don't hesitate
To get to heaven, went through hell
Tell my peeps all is well
All them fools whose soul's for sale
Sitting next to the Jezebel
Demons screamin' in my ear
All my anger, all my fear
If I holler, let them hear
In this spinning sphere[Chorus]
Fuck the slice, want the pie
Why ask why 'til we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs, women, wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
[Verse 2]
Main ingredients (Uh) to this dish (Yeah)
Goes like this, here's the list
Materialistic, greed and lust, jealousy, envious
Bread and dough, cheddar cheese
Flash and stash, cash and cream
Temperature's at a high degree
Where niggas come to feast
Hell is this all about?
Apocalypse, ain't no doubt
Everybody's ho'ing out
All the loot, all the clout
Right or wrong, do or die
Only vengeance could pacify
Watch your back and so will I
In these days and time[Chorus]
Fuck the slice, want the pie
Why ask why 'til we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs, women, wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
[Interlude]
(Tryna eat)
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
(If you want the pie)
(On a plate)
(Check it out)
(Mark of the beast)
(This how it be in this everlasting game)
[Bridge]
Oh, woah-woah-woah-woah
Oh
Oh-oh-oh, woah-woah-woah
Ah[Verse 3]
Ain't no justice, it's just us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Time has come for most of us
To choose in which God we trust
I know I was born to die
Searching to find a peace of mind
With eighty-five, dumb and blind
There can be no compromise
[Chorus]
Fuck the slice (Yeah), want the pie (Uh)
Why ask why 'til we fry ('Til we gon' fry)
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie (Yeah, yeah)
Drugs and thugs (Oh-oh), women, wine (Huh)
Three or four at a time
[Outro]
Uh, wait a minute
Uh, let me tell you 'bout a slice of the devil's pie (Oh-oh)
Uh, said everybody out there can get down with the slice of the devil's pie (Oh-oh-oh, huh)
For a slice of the devil's pie
Little women in the streets sell her fuckin' body for a slice of the devil's pie (Oh-oh)
Niggas killin' each other in the streets for a slice of the devil's pie
Say what?
All in line, all in line (Oh)
For a slice of the devil's pie (Yeah)
All in line, all in line (Give me some)
For a slice of the devil's pie
All in line, all in line (What? Huh?)
For a slice of the devil's pie (Yeah)
All in line, all in line (I don't give a fuck, I ain't goin' out for theâ€”)
For a slice of the devil's pie (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
