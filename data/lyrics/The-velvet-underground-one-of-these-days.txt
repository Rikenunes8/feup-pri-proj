[Verse 1]
One of these days, ain't it peculiar?
You're gonna look for me and baby, I'll be gone
One of these days and it won't be long
Oh, darling, gonna call my name and I'll be far gone
[Bridge]
I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is, if I can stop dancing
And get my poor self off this barroom floor
[Verse 2]
One of these days, ain't it peculiar?
Babe, you're gonna call my name you know that I'll be gone
(Bye, bye, baby)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is, if I can stop dancing
And get my poor self off this barroom floor
[Outro]
One of these days and it won't be long
You're going to call my name and I'll be gone
You're going to call my name and I'll be gone
Oh, you're going to call my name, child and I'll be gone
