[Verse]
Mama, where's your little daughter?
She's here, right here on the altar
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never going to see her no more
You don't know what I can do with this axe
Chop off your head, so you better relax
[Chorus]
You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
[Verse]
Mama, where's your little daughter?
She's here, right here on the altar
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never going to see her no more
You don't know what I can do with this axe
Chop off your head, so you better relax
[Chorus]
You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
[Repeat to fade out]
(Open that door)
