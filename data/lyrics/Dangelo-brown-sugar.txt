[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout this girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See, we be making love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade blood burgundy
The way that we kiss is unlike any other way
That I be kissin' when I'm kissin' what I'm missin'
Won't you listen?
[Chorus]
Brown Sugar, babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Oh, Sugar, when you're close to me
You love me right down to my knees
And whenever you let me hit it
Sweet like honey when it comes to me
Skin is caramel with the cocoa eyes
Even got a big sister by the name of Chocolate Thai[Chorus]
Brown Sugar, babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar, oh)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
Ooh, ooh
[Interlude]
Yo, Tail, cut me up some
[Verse 3]
Now that'd be how the story goes
Brown Sugar got me open, now I want some more, huh
Always down for a ménage à trois
But I think I'ma hit it solo
Hope my niggas don't mind
Stick out my tongue and I'm 'bout
Ready to hit this pretty gritty
Bitty with persistence
Yo, I don't think y'all hear me
[Chorus]
Brown Sugar, babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Oh, baby)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(I want some of your brown sugar, baby)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Oh, babe, oh, yeah)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Oh, gimme some of your brown sugar, baby)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Baby, oh, babe)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(I-I, oh, babe)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Ooh, babe, ooh, oh, babe)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Brown sugar, so sweet, baby)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Baby, so good to me, baby)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Oh, brown sugar, yeah, oh)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Brown, brown)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Oh, oh, baby)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Sugar, baby, sweet to me every night)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Brown sugar in my cup)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(Oh, brown sugar, baby, sweet as could be)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
(You're so good to me, oh-oh)
I want some of your brown sugar (Sugar)
