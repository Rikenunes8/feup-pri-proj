They told you in school about freedom
But when you try to be free they never let ya
They said, "It's easy, nothing to it"
And now the army's out to get ya
Sixty-nine America in terminal stasis
The air's so thick it's like drowning in molasses
I'm sick and tired of paying these dues
And I'm finally getting hip to the American ruse
I learned to say the Pledge of Allegiance
Before they beat me bloody down at the station
They haven't got a word out of me since
I got a billion years probation
Sixty-nine America in terminal stasis
The air's so thick it's like drowning in molasses
I'm sick and tired of paying these dues
And I'm sick to my guts of the American ruse
Phony stars, oh no! crummy cars, oh no!
Cheap guitars, oh no! Joe's primitive barâ€¦nah!
Rock 'em back, Sonic!
The way they pull you over it's suspicious
Yeah, for something that just ain't your fault
If you complain they're gonna get vicious
Kick in the teeth and charge you with assault
Yeah, but I can see 
the chickens coming home to roost
Young people everywhere are gonna cook their goose
Lots of kids are working to get rid of these blues
'Cause everybody's sick of the American ruse
Well well well, take a look around!
Well well well, take a look around!
Well well well, take a look around!
Well well well, take a look around!
Well well well, take a look around!
