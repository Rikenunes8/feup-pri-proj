Newtown where everybody goes around sniffing televisena
Or taking footballina
Newtown
Gimme another fix
Oh, gimme another fix
If not I'll go sick
If not I'll go sick
I'll be sick
Morning papers will bring you something flash!
Make your bones shake
Keep busy your mind
Newtown
Gimme another fix
I I I need another fix
If not I'll go sick
If not I'll go sick
I'll be sick sick sick sick
Morning in the city, Mr. Simpson is a speedin freak
Taking huncholyna
Or sniffing phoncallina
Newtown
Down town
Drop down
Stick around
Feeling down
Might be some coming out
Football colors all around
Dropping PC late at night
Waiting for a fight
Newtown
Newtown where everybody goes around sniffing televisena
Or taking footballina

Oh gimme another fix
I I I need another fix
If not I'll go sick
If not I'll go sick
I'll be sick
