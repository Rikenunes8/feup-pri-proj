[Verse 1]
Today, you're gonna be so sick, so sick
You'll prop your forehead on the sink
Say, "Oh, Christ, oh, Jesus Christ
My head's gonna crack like a bank."
[Verse 2]
Tonight, you'll fall asleep in clothes
So late like a candy bar wrapped up
For lunch, that's all you get to taste
Poverty and spit
Poverty and spit
[Chorus]
Nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to sleep
[Verse 3]
Today, you're gonna be so sick, so sick
You'll prop your forehead on the sink
Say, "Oh, Christ, oh, Jesus Christ
My head's gonna crack like a bank."[Verse 4]
Tonight, you'll fall asleep in clothes
So late like a candy bar wrapped up
For lunch, that's all you get to taste
Poverty and spit
Spit, spit
[Chorus]
Nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to sleep
[Bridge]
Talking out of harmony
You can't remember what you said
Cut it out, you feel retarded
Take the scissors, saw the head
Talking out of harmony
Can't remember what you said
Cut it out, you feel retarded
Take the scissors, saw the head
[Chorus]
Nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to sleep
