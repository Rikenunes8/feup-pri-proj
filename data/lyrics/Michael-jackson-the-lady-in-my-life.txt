[Verse 1]
There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away
[Chorus]
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And, baby, through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life
[Verse 2]
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
[Chorus]
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And, baby, through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life
[Bridge]
Stay with me
I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go nowhere
(Ooh, girl, let me keep you warm)
Let me keep you warm
(You are the lady in my life)
You're my lady
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
I want to squeeze you
(Always the lady in my life)
I want to touch you, baby
(Lay back in my tenderness)
(You are the lady in my life)
(Rock me with your sweet caress)
(Always the lady in my life)
You're my lady and I love you, girl
(Ooh, girl, let me keep you warm)
(You are the lady in my life)
Don't you go nowhere
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
(Always the lady in my life)
I love you I, love you, I need you, I want you, baby
(Lay back in my tenderness)
Stay with me
(You are the lady in my life)
Don't you go nowhere
(Rock me with your sweet caress)
And I love you, baby
(Always the lady in my life)
Woo, ooh, baby
Don't go nowhere
You're my lady
All through the night[Outro]
(Ooh, girl, let me keep you warm)
I want to give you all
(You are the lady in my life)
In my life
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
Let me be your baby
(Always the lady in my life)
All over, all over, all over
(Lay back in my tenderness)
Lay back with me
(You are the lady in my life)
Let me touch you, girl
(Rock me with your sweet caress)
Lay back with me
(Always the lady in my life)
All over, all over, all over
(Ooh, girl, let me keep you warm)
All over, all over
(You are the lady in my life)
All over, all over, baby, woo
(Fill you with the sweetest love)
(Always the lady in my life)
You're my lady
(Lay back in my tenderness)
You're my lady, babe
(You are the lady in my life)
