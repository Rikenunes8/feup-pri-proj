[Verse 1]
I see your face before me
Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always
[Verse 3]
If you could share the magic
Yes, if you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
[Refrain]
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me
[Interlude]
[Refrain]
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me
