[Verse 1]
"Darling, you were wonderful, you really were quite good
I enjoyed it, though, of course, no one understood
A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue
They couldn't understand your sense of humour like I do"
[Pre-Chorus]
"You're much too kind"
I smiled with murder on my mind
[Chorus]
Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me
[Verse 2]
"You have a certain quality, which really is unique
Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak
It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud
Of course, it's all on tape, but no one will find out"
[Pre-Chorus]
You hated me too
But not as much as I hated you
[Chorus]
Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me
[Post-Chorus]
Then when I was lonely
I thought again
And changed my mind
[Verse 3]
Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners
And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner
And someone said: "It's fabulous you're still around today
You've both made such a little go a very long way"[Chorus]
Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me
[Chorus]
Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me
[Post-Chorus]
Then, when I was lonely
I thought again
And changed my mind
