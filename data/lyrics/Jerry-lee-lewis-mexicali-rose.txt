Mexicali rose, please stop your cryin'
I'm comin' back again some sunny day
You know, dear, every hour, I'm pinin'
Every hour, dear, though I'm away
Oh, dry your big brown eyes and smile, dear
Banish all your tears, honey, please don't cry
Kiss me once again and hold me
Mexicali rose, goodbye
[Instrumental Break]
Well, dry your big brown eyes and smile, dear
Honey, banish all your tears and please don't cry
Well, kiss me once again and hold me
Mexicali rose, goodbye, goodbye
Mexicali rose, goodbye
