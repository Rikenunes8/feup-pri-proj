[Intro]
There's a new sensation
A fabulous creation
A danceable solution
To teenage revolution
[Verse 1]
Do the Strand, love
When you feel love
It's the new way
That's why we say
"Do the Strand"
[Chorus 1]
Do it on the tables
Quaglino's place
 or Mabel's
[Verse 2]
Slow and gentle
Sentimental
All styles served here
Louis Seize he prefer
Laissez-faire Le Strand
[Chorus 2]
Tired of the Tango
Fed up with Fandango
[Verse 3]
Dance on moonbeams
Slide on rainbows
In furs or blue jeans
You know what I mean
Do the Strand
Ooh
[Bridge]
Had your fill of Quadrilles
The Madison and cheap thrills
Bored with the Beguine
The Samba isn't your scene[Verse 4]
They're playing our tune
By the pale moon
We're incognito
Down the Lido
And we like the Strand
[Chorus 3]
Arabs at oases
Eskimos and Chinese
[Verse 5]
If you feel blue
Look through Who's Who
See La Goulue
And Nijinsky
Do the Strandsky
[Chorus 4]
Weary of the Waltz
And mashed potato schmaltz
[Verse 6]
Rhododendron
Is a nice flower
Evergreenin'
It lasts forever
But it can't beat Strand power[Outro]
The Sphynx and Mona Lisa
Lolita and Guernica
Did the Strand
