A walk in the park.
I've got to get some sense
Back into my head.
I`m in the dark.
And I can`t see
Where I`m being led.
I`d give the world
To set the clock back
And act like a man.
Where can I turn
To save myself from this confusion.
A walk in the park, a step in the dark.
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark.
I`m getting away, escaping today.
A walk in the park.
Away from all
The busy streets of my mind.
I seek a straighter path.
I seek a shady clay in which to unwind.
But why do we go on.
In spite of mistakes.
In spite of destruction.
Life can be fun
Depending on the situation.
A walk in the park, a step in the dark.
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark.
I`m getting away, escaping today.
A walk in the park, a step in the dark.
A walk in the park. 
I`m getting away.
A walk in the park.
I`m getting away.
