[Verse 1]
Who needs remote control
From the Civic Hall?
Push a button
Activate
You gotta work
You're late
[Verse 2]
It's so grey in London town
Panda car crawlin' around
Here it comes
Eleven o'clock
Where can we go now?
[Chorus]
Can't make no noise
Can't get no gear
Can't make no money
Can't get outta here
[Verse 3]
Big business, it don't like you
Don't like the things you do
They got no money
They got no power
They think you're useless
And so you are, punk
[Verse 4]
They had a meeting in Mayfair
They got you down and they wanna keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
That's all that matters
You don't count
[Chorus]
Can't make no progress
Can't get ahead
Can't stop the regress
Don't wanna be dead[Post-Chorus]
(Look out those rules and regulations)
[Verse 5]
Who needs the Parliament?
Sittin' makin' laws all day
They're all fat and old
Queuein' for the House of Lords
Repression (Gonna start on Tuesday)
Repression (Gonna be a Dalek)
Repression (I am a robot)
Repression (I obey)
