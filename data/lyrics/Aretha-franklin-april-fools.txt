[Intro]
April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools
April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools
[Verse 1]
In an April dream
Once you came to me
You smiled, I looked into your eyes and I knew
I'd be loving you, and
Then you touched my hand, and I knew
April dreams could come true
[Chorus]
Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools?
I don't care, true love has found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now) Woo, yes, it has
(April fool, true love's found us now) Uh-huh
[Verse 2]
Little did we know where the road would lead
Here we are, a million miles away
From the past, traveling so fast, and
There is no turning back if our sweet April dream doesn't last
[Chorus]
Are we just April fools (Are we just April fools?)
Who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? (Are we just April fools?)
I don't care (I don't care)
True love has found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now) Yes, it has
(April fool, true love's found us now)
(April fool, true love's found us now) Yes, it has
(April fool, true love's found us now)
[Verse 3]
Little did we know where the road would lead
Here we are, a million miles away
From the past, traveling so fast, and
There's no turning back if our sweet April dream doesn't last[Chorus]
Are we just April fools (Are we just April fools?)
Who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? (Are we just April fools?)
I don't care (I don't care)
True love has found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now)
(April fool, true love's found us now) It's found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now) Yeah, true love
(April fool, true love's found us now) Has found us now
[Outro]
April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools
April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools
(April fool, true love's found us now) True love
(April fool, true love's found us now) Has found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now) April fool, has found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now) True love has found us now
(April fool)
