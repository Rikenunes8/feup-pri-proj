[Verse 1]
She walks with a bell clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time, time
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck
[Chorus]
She's so fine
She's so very very fine
[Verse 2]
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind, mind
Morning sign sounds just like a lark
All these signs are always the  start
[Chorus]
She's so fine
She's so very very fine
[Bridge]
When I veer I get so near
But so far, far, far away
Listen to me today
[Outro]
We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her
She's so fine, fine
