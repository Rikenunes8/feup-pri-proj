[Verse 1]
This name I got we all agreed
C could stop, stop it well read
We could bind it in the scythe
We could gather, throw a fit
[Chorus]
Up to par and Katie bar
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
[Verse 2]
I'm the sun and you can read
I'm the sign and you're not deaf
We could bind it in the scythe
We could gather, throw a fit
[Chorus]
Up to par and Katie bars
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
[Verse 3]
This name I got we all agreed
C could stop, stop it well read
We could bind it in the scythe
We could gather, throw a fit
[Chorus]
Up to par and Katie bars
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you[Verse 4]
You can gather when I talk
Talk until you're blue
You could get away from me
Get away from me
[Chorus]
I'm up to par and Katie bars
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
[Outro]
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
Can you hear me?
