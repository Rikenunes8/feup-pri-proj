[Verse]
No letter today, I have waited since dawn
I've waited each day since you have been gone
No letter today, all the days are so long
Why don't you write? I know I was wrong
[Bridge]
Give me one chance, please, won't you forgive?
I'll love you, my dear, as a long I live
I know it's no use, but I hope and I pray
The postman goes by, no letter today
[Piano Solo]
[Outro]
I know it's no use, so I hope and I pray
The postman goes by, no letter today
No letter today, no letter today
No letter today, yes
