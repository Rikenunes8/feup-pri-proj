[Intro]
This song is called "A Bullet in Your Head"
Yeah, so get with this
[Verse 1]
This time the bullet cold rocked ya, yeah
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red, yeah
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds
[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
Check this shit out, uh
[Guitar Solo]
[Spoken]
Yeah, that shit's proper funky
Uh
[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
[Verse 2]
Checka, checka, check it out
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again, Jack, and then rewind the tape
And then play it again, and again, and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say "how high?"
Ya braindead, ya got a fuckin' bullet in ya head[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
[Interlude]
Uh
[Bridge]
Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya got a bullet in ya head
Am I standin' in line?
Am I believin' the lies?
I'm bowin' down to the flag
I got a bullet in my head
[Outro]
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
You got a bullet in your fuckin' head
Yeah
Yeah
