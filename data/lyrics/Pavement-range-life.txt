[Verse 1]
After the glow, the scene, the stage, the set
Talk becomes slow, but there's one thing I'll never forget
Hey, you gotta pay your dues
Before you pay the rent
Over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
There's ways of living; It's the way I'm living
Right or wrong, it's all that I can do
And I wouldn't wanna let you be
[Chorus]
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
[Break]
[Verse 2]
Run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
Pass me your gloves, this crime, it is never complete
Until you snort it up and shoot it down
You're never gonna feel free
Out on my skateboard, the night is just humming
And the gums smacks are the pulse I'll follow if my Walkman fades
But I've got absolutely no one
No one but myself to blame[Bridge]
But don't worry, we're in no hurry
School's out, what did you expect?
[Chorus]
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
Yeah
[Break]
[Verse 3]
Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins
Nature kids, I, they don't have no function
I don't understand what they mean
And I could really give a fuck
The Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant bachelors
They're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
I will agree they deserve absolutely nothing
Nothing more than me[Outro]
Dreamin', dream dream dream dream dream
