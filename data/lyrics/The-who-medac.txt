Henry Pond had no fun
Had a face like a currant bun
This adolescent little fella
Was nicknamed by his friends "Old Yella"
The doctors gave him creams and lotions
To try to sooth the boy's emotions
But all in vain; the acne stayed
Henry's hopes began to fade
Then, when just about to crack
He found another cream - Medac
When Henry in the mirror peered
His pimples all had disappeared
Henry laughed and yelled "I got 'em!
Me face is like a baby's bottom"
