[Verse 1]
You always find a way to hurt my pride
If I am not crying, you're not satisfied
I don't know why you want to hurt me so
But if you're trying to break my heart
You don't have very far to go
[Verse 2]
You don't have very far to go before the heartache begins
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You can't love me and still love to hurt me so
If you're trying to break my heart
You don't have very far to go
[Verse 3]
You don't have very far to go before the heartache begins
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You're turning down the flame of love too low
If you're trying to break my heart
You don't have very far to go
