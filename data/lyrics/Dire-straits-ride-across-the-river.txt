[Verse 1]
I'm a soldier of freedom in the army of the men
We are the chosen, we're the partisan, alright
Well the cause it is noble and the cause it is just
We are ready to pay with our lives if we must
[Chorus]
Gonna ride across the river, deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side
[Verse 2]
I'm a soldier of fortune, I'm a dog of war, yeah
And we don't give a damn-a who the killing is for
It's the same old story with a different name
Death or glory, it's the killing game
[Chorus]
Gonna ride across the river 
deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side
[Instrumental break 2:09-3:24]
[Verse 3]
Oh, nothing gonna stop them
As the day follows the night
Right becomes wrong, the left becomes the right
And they sing as they march
With their flags unfurled
Today in the mountains, tomorrow the world[Chorus]
Gonna ride across the river,  deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side
Gonna ride across the river, deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side
[Instrumental outro 4:18-6:57]
