[Verse 1]
Oh, did you know I'm a wanted man?
Steeped in black, where the sun won't pass
I never needed anyone, no-oh
I never needed anyone, no-oh
[Chorus]
Young hearts must flame
Hell must roil
And feeling this all and all that surrounds you
It's I who admits he'll lie in wait
[Verse 2]
Lord knows I've been gunning fast, oh
On seven's six, low on thirteen black
I never needed anyone, no-oh-oh
I never needed anyone, no-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Saturn curdles sleep
Death will change a heart
I'm feeling this all and all that surrounds you
It's I who admits he'll lie in wait
[Verse 3]
Strike earth, ply name
Rend sulfur to sage
I'm feeling this all and all that surrounds you
Here he comes, here comes a wanted man
So step back, where the word don't last
I never needed anyone, no-oh-oh
I never needed anyone, no-no-no[Chorus]
Young hearts will change
Hell will have its roil
And feeling this all and all that surrounds you
It's I who admits he'll lie in wait
