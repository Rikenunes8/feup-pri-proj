It's been a long and loney lonely year
Since the last time I saw you my dear
Don't you remember when I was in my surrender
I said I'd always love you endlessly
Hey little sweetheart, so how you doing now?
I thought without me you probably would drown
I guess I was wrong and for that it's so long
Take care my darling, I hope to see you 'round
Parting with you I'll never ever get
Our love can be here and instantly regretted
You showed me love and gave me understanding
Baby with out you it's going to leave me shredded
It's been a long and loney lonely year
Since the last time I saw you my dear
Don't you remember when I was in my surrender
I said I'd always love you endlessly
I said I'd always love you endlessly
I said I'd always love you endlessly
