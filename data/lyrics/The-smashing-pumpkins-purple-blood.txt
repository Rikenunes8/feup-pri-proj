[Verse 1]
I'm in love with your god
I'm in love with your fear
By the touch of your hand
I'm far from here
Oh, for sunny days
When life was flat embrace
And might love come what may
[Pre-Chorus]
Shot to ground
Set it off
Like your phoenix, I will fly
From dread dawns to sky
[Chorus]
I'm in love with your god
[Verse 2]
Fever by your side
Sun is so you cannot rise
Fever by your side
Sun is so you cannot rise
I'm in love with your god
I'm in love with said fear
By the blush of your thorn
I'm lost but near
But, oh, for sunny days
[Pre-Chorus]
Shot to ground
Set it off
Like your phoenix, I will fly
From dread dawns to sky
[Chorus]
I'm in love with your god
I'm in love with your god
[Verse 3]
Fever by your side
Sun is so you cannot rise
Fever by your side
Sun is so you cannot rise
Hunger greets far fleece
So solace, thunder agony
A fever by your side
Sun is so you cannot rise
