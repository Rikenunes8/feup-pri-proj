[Intro]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
I do, I do
[Verse 1]
But I told you why we just can't make it
I want you still but just can't take it
The time has come we oughta break it
Someone had to pay the price
[Bridge]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Over
It's true, it's true
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Over
It's true, it's true
[Verse 2]
And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed
Now things are better
Someone had to pay the price
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed
Now things are better
Someone had to pay the price
