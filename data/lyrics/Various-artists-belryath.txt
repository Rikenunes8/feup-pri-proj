Baby just breathe
A couple breaths is all you need
Baby just breathe now
A couple breaths is all you need
Baby just breathe
A couple breaths is all you need
Baby just breathe now
A couple breaths is all you need

Everybody faced their  while I wait my turn
Everything seems so bleak but I know what I learnt
Everything seems so spent but I know what I’ve earnt
Ain’t nobody living in vain, all of us got wills
Ain’t nobody’s life go to waste, that’s just how you feel
Don’t nobody know you’re a  til they take your pills
Don’t nobody pull your reins til they see your 
Baby just breathe
A couple breaths is all you need
Baby just breathe now
A couple breaths is all you need
Baby just breathe
A couple breaths is all you need
Baby just breathe now
A couple breaths is all you need

A few of us try so hard while the rest just watch
A few of us try so hard while the rest don’t stop
A few of us speak for the ones who ain’t found their voice

Pay attention to the ones who say and the ones who know

Breathe
