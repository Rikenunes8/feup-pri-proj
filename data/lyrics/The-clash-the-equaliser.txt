No! Gangboss no!
We don't want the whip!
As you get weaker
We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize
We gang, we want to equalize till
No! Gangboss no!
We don't want the whip!
As you get weaker, it will get harder
So don't be like them
Your bones of effort and strength
Don't sell out to them
We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize
We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize
To my father's father's father work was no joy
When his son, grown of age, you've got to work now my boy
Father, father's father, they've had to work hard boy
Never ceasing for many years, want to follow that boy?
(Chorus)
'Til half and half is equalized, oh put down the tools
See the car, see the house, see the fabulous jewels
See the world you have built in with shoulders of iron
See the world but it is not yours say the stealers of Zion
(Chorus)
Geneva, Wall Street
Who makes them so fat?
Well well, me an' you
Better think about that in overdrive
Till humanize is equalize
Oh, put down the tools
Every face on every side
Throw down the tools(Chorus)
Going home, don't check with Rome
Paint strike on the door
It's one to one, the fight is on
So don't go to war
(Chorus)
Prove me wrong
