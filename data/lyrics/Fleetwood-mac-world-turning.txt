[Verse 1]
Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong
[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night
[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night
[Chorus]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
[Outro]
Umm turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down
