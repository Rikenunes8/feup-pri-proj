[Verse 1]
Like the lion, I will track our rulers
Into the cracks of this earth
'Twixt the field and the foal, unaided
Yet spun with the toil of an oath
[Pre-Chorus]
Three days unknown, two days agone
I'm harvest more than guide
Isidore was right
[Chorus]
Forgotten, familiar
Find your light
Fain autumns, winter side
Find your light, find your light
Mark the hurt, mark the face
Mark the dirt of cloven graves
Find your light
Forgotten, familiar
Find your light
[Verse 2]
As the bull on the wheel, I follow
Stubborn, with downcast eyes
'Round the hills of our lord and hollows
In sacrifice of his own[Pre-Chorus]
Three days unknown, two days agone
I'm shadow more than guide
Isidore was right
[Chorus]
Forgotten, familiar
Find your light
Fain autumns, winter side
Find your light, find your light
Mark the coil, mark the reed
Mark the piper, go to sleep
Find your light
Forgotten, familiar
Find your light
Find your light
