I told you once before
That I love you
And I need you
But let me tell you once again

I'll never leave you
So hold me tight
All through the night
Caress me with your tender care
Anytime or anywhere
[Pre-Chorus]
Anytime, anywhere
I will go with you anywhere
Please won't you trust me, baby?
Won't you trust in me, baby?
Stay with me
'Til death do us part

You'll always be right in my heart
Won't you please stay with me?
Baby, please believe in me
Please believe in me

You gotta believe me that
Mary, Mary, I hear you loud and clear[Verse 2]
Why don't you believe in me?
Tell me why you don't see
That you can put your trust in me
And let me lead the way
Please, baby, take my hand
I don't need another man
But if you wanna hold on tight
You cannot be afraid
