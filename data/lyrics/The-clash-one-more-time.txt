Must I get a witness for all this misery?
There's no need to brothers, everybody can see
That it's a'one more time in the ghetto
One more time if you please
One more time to the dyin' man
One more time to be free
One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free
One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free
The old lady kicks karate
For just a little walk down the street
The little baby knows Kung Fu
He tries it on those he meets
'Cause its a'one more time in the ghetto
One more time if you please now
One more time to the dyin' man
They say one more time if you please
(Chorus 1)
(Chorus 2)(Chorus 1)
You don't need no silicone to calculate poverty
Watch when Watts town burns again
The bus goes to Montgomery
'Cause it's a one more time in the ghetto
One more time, yeah
One more time, dying man
One more time if you please
One more time (x4)
