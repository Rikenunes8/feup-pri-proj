Sweet, sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget my past and live my life anew
Instead I'm having sweet dreams about you

You, you don't love me, it's plain
I should have known you'd never wear my name
I, I should hate you girl, the whole night through
Instead I'm having sweet dreams about you

I, I should hate you girl, the whole night through
Instead I'm having sweet dreams about you
Instead I'm having sweet dreams about you
