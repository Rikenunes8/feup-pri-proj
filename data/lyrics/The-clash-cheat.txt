[Verse 1]
I get violent when I'm fucked up
I get silent when I'm drugged up
Want excitement, don't get none, I go wild
I don't know what can be done about it
If you play the game you get nothin' out of it
Find out for yourself, try bein' a goody goody
[Chorus]
You better cheat, cheat, no reason to play fair
Cheat, cheat or don't get anywhere
Cheat, cheat if you can't win
Hey
[Verse 2]
Nobody knows what they are doin'
Beyond your control, Friday night's a ruin
You wanna survive, you better learn how to lie
[Chorus]
You better cheat, cheat, no reason to play fair
Cheat, cheat or don't get anywhere
Cheat, cheat if you can't win
[Verse 3]
Don't use the rules
They're not for you, they're for the fools
And you're a fool if you don't know that
So use the rule, you stupid fool
