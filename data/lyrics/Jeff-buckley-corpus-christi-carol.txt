[Intro]
He bear her off, he bear her down
He bear her into an orchard ground
[Chorus]
Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away
[Verse 1]
And in that orchard there was a hold
That was hanged with purple and gold
And in that hold there was a bed
And it was hanged with gold so red
[Chorus]
Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away
[Verse 2]
And on this bed there lyeth a knight
His wound is bleeding day and night
By his bedside kneeleth a maid
And she weepeth both night and day
[Chorus]
Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away[Outro]
By his bedside standeth a stone
Corpus christi written thereon
