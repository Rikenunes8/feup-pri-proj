[Chorus]
Oh my love for the first time in my life
My eyes are wide open
Oh my lover for the first time in my life
My eyes can see
[Verse 1]
I see the wind, oh I see the trees
Everything is clear in my heart
I see the clouds, oh I see the sky
Everything is clear in our world
[Chorus]
Oh my love for the first time in my life
My mind is wide open
Oh my lover for the first time in my life
My mind can feel
[Verse 2]
I feel the sorrow, oh I feel the dreams
Everything is clear in my heart
I feel life, oh I feel love
Everything is clear in our world
