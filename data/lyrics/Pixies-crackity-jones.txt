[Verse 1]
José Jones
Told me alone his story
He got friends like 
Paco Picopiedra
La muñeca he receives on his set
[Chorus]
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack!
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
(Wup, wup!)
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
[Verse 2]
Please forgive me, José Jones
You need these walls for your own
I'm movin' out of this hospedaje
I'm afraid you'll cut me, boy
[Verse 3]
Thirty miles by
Hundred miles by stinkin' island
Por confiar en crushing automovil
Chasing voices, 
he receives in his head
[Chorus]
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
(Whoop, whoop!)
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack!
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
(Whoop, whoop!)
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
