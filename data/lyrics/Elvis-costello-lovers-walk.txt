[Verse 1]
I won't walk with my head bowed
Beyond caution where lovers walk
Your love walks where three's a crowd
Beyond caution where lovers walk
[Verse 2]
Lovers walk, lovers scramble
Beyond caution where the lovers walk
Lovers step, shuffle and gamble
Beyond caution where lovers walk
[Verse 3]
Lovers trip, lovers stumble
Lovers dip, lovers fumble
Lovers lip where love has crumbled
Beyond caution where lovers walk
[Verse 4]
Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lovers leap
Lovers late, lovers wait
Making promises that they can't keep
Lovers link up arm and arm
Lovers slink up, lovers charm
Lovers drink up and come to harm
Beyond caution where lovers walk
[Verse 5]
Love is gone and it's no one's fault
Love has stopped here, lovers halt
Lovers don't walk, lovers run
Will you look what love has done
Will you look what love has done
Will you look what love has done
Beyond caution where lovers walk
[Outro]
Now love's limping on a lover's crutch
Looking for a hand with a personal touch
Beyond caution where lovers walk
Beyond caution where lovers walk
Beyond caution where lovers walk
Beyond caution where lovers walk
