[Verse 1]
Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart say "Go go, have a time"
'Cause Saturday night and I'm feel fine
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight
[Verse 2]
Got me a date and I won't be late
Picked her up in my 88
Shag on down by the union hall
When the joint starts jumping I have a ball
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight
[Verse 3]
Along about ten I'll be flying high
Rock on out unto the sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight, I'm gonna be one happy soul
[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight, ow[Saxophone Solo]
