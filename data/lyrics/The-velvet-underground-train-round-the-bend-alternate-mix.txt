Train round the bend
Taking me away from my country
I'm sick of the trees take me to the city
Train coming round the bend
Oh, train coming round the bend
Been in the country oh, much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted ever seems to grow
Train coming round the bend
Woah, train coming round the bend
Hey, I am just a city boy
And really not the country kind
Oh, I need the city streets and I need your light
To see bend coming round the bend, oh what
The train coming round the bend
Once, she's going twice
She's going to the loop up and down
She's going once, she's going twice
She's going the train coming round the bend
You know the train coming round the bend
And I'm out of nowhere
Taking me back where I belong
I've been here once and I don't take it tonight
For the train comings round the bend
Oh, the train coming round the bend
Alright
[Incomprehensible]
Take me back where I belong
I've been in the country very much too long
The train coming round the bend
Look out for the train coming round the bend
