[Verse 1]
I should wander
Yet I shalln't gander far
Beyond her spells enchant
As red made roses
As red made crimson morns
Black makes my blood char
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm ruthless
Ain't the kind to see
I know I'm ruthless, sigh
[Chorus]
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona
Storms with thee
Ramona, ain't it just like I dreamed?
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona
You with me
Ramona, let's not say we're bound
I know I'm ruthless
Ain't the kind to free
[Verse 2]
I've been riding high
I've been riding stone alone
Right out of my mind[Bridge]
Ooh, the incantations of
The souls she's torched to dust
By hex that had no stage
Of all the evidence
Of all I've ever been
Was some innocence to where I belonged
By the elements, I've been roaming too long
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm ruthless
Ain't the kind to plead
[Chorus]
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona
Storms with thee
Ramona, ain't it just like I dreamed?
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona
You with me
Ramona, let's not say we're bound
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona
Deliver thee
Ramona, ain't it like I dreamed?
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona
You with me
Ramona, Ramona, please
