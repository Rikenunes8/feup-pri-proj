It used to be fun was in
The capture and kill
In another place and time
I did it all for thrills
Love me and I'll leave you
I told you at the start
I had no idea that you
Would tear my world apart
And you're the one to blame
I used to know my name
But I've lost control of the game
Cause even though I set the rules
You've got me acting like a fool
When I see you I lose my cool
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust turned to love
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust turned to love
That was when the fun was in
The capture and the kill
In another place and time
I did it all for thrills
Love me and I'll leave you
I told you at the start
I had no idea that you
Would tear my world apart
And you're the one to blame
I used to know my name
But I've lost control of the game
Cause even though I set the rules
You've got me acting like a fool
When I see you I lose my coolLust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust turned to love
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust turned to love
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
