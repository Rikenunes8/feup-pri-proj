[Verse]
My friend came to me
With sadness in his eyes
He told me that he wanted help
Before his country dies
Although I couldn't feel the pain
I knew I had to try
Now I'm asking all of you
To help us save some lives
[Chorus]
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Where so many people are dying fast
And it sure looks like a mess
I've never seen such distress
Now won't you lend your hand, try to understand?
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
[Chorus]
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Such a great disaster, I don't understand
But it sure looks like a mess
I've never known such distress
Now please don't turn away, I wanna hear you say
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
[Chorus]
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Now it may seem so far from where we all are
It's something we can't reject
It's something I can't neglect
Now won't you give some bread? Get the starving fed?
We've got to relieve Bangladesh
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
We've got to relieve Bangladesh
[Outro]
Now won't you lend your hand and understand?
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
