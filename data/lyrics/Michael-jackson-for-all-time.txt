[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well
[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there
[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say
[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
[Outro]
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
(That's for all time)
(That's for all time)
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all time
