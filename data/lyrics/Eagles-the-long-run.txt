[Verse 1]
I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
Till I found you
[Chorus 1]
You can go the distance
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through
[Chorus 2]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
[Verse 2]
You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?[Chorus 3]
Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)
[Pre-Chorus 4]
Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'
[Chorus 4]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
In the long run
In the long run
[Outro]
Gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out
Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long
