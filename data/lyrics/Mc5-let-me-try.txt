I'll be your singer
You'll be my song
I'll lay you down softly
I'll love you long
I'll be there
To keep you satisfied
If you'll only let me try, hey hey
Let me try, hey hey, yeah
You've been neglected
You've been abused
But I'll give you pleasure
Deep inside of you
I'll always be near
Right there by your side
If you'll only let me try, hey hey
Let me try, hey hey, yeah
/ INSTRUMENTAL /
Let me try, hey hey
Let me try, hey hey, yeah
I'll play you like music
I'll sing you like a song
I'll lay you down gentle
I'll love you strong
I'll dry your teardrops
Each time you cry
Wrap you in my arms
Set you on fire
If you'll only let me try, hey hey
Let me try, hey hey, yeah
I'll be your singer
You'll be my song
La da da da
La da da da
