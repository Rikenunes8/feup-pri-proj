[Verse 1]
Hit dirt
Shake tree
Split sky
Part sea
[Verse 2]
Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule
[Verse 3]
Live win
Dare fail
Eat the dirt
And bite the nail
[Pre-Chorus]
Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you
[Chorus]
So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby[Verse 4]
Draw Lead
Piss wine
Sink teeth
All mine
[Verse 5]
Stoke fire
Break neck
Suffer through this
Cheat on death
[Verse 6]
Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign
[Pre-Chorus]
Then make me miss you
Oh yeah
Then make me miss you
[Chorus]
So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby[Bridge]
Ah, ah, yeah, suck it!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Live win
Dare fail
Eat the dirt
And bite the nail
[Verse 2]
Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule
[Verse 7]
Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign
[Pre-Chorus]
Then make me miss you
Come on, come on
Then make me miss you[Chorus]
So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby
[Outer]
Come make me miss you
Come carpe diem, baby
Come carpe diem, baby
