[Verse 1]
Someone clean to chew on
A wife that no one likes
I called and they said 
all of New York
Was a tow-away zone
We paid sixty dollars on 12th Street today
And now all our money's gone
[Chorus]
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phone's off the hook
But you're not
[Verse 2]
You hate my older sister
And you burglarize her home
Your dirty invitation waits
Run over on my street
I don't care who you don't like
You don't have to answer me
[Chorus]
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phone's off the hook
But you're not
[Verse 3]
Someone clean to chew on
A wife that no one likes
I called and they said all of New York
Was a tow-away zone
We paid sixty dollars on 12th Street today
And now all our money's gone
[Chorus]
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phone's off the hook
But you're not[Outro]
But you're not
But you're not
But you're not
