I'm just a little beggar girl and Sally is my name
You can call me a skiver and I'll call you the same
You can show me you're sorry if you think it's a shame
That I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
You can show me you're sorry if you think it's a shame
That I'm only a poor little beggar girl
I'll dance with my peg leg a-wiggling at the knee
I'll play on the accordion my father gave to me
For it's well worth it all to please a gent such as thee
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
And it's well worth it all to please a gent such as thee
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
I've been down to London, I've been up to Crewe
I travel far and wide to do the work that I do
'Cause I love taking money off a snob like you
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
And I love taking money off a snob like you
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Oh the poor they will be rich and the rich they will be poor
That's according to Saul when he wrote down the law
And I'd much rather be rich after than before
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
And I'd much rather be rich after than before
For I'm only a poor little beggar girlIf the words of my song do your conscience alarm
Just remember generosity is like a lucky charm
If you give me your money, it'll do you no harm
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
If you give me your money, it'll do you no harm
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
