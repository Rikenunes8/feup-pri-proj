[Verse 1]
Manic depression is searching my soul
I know what I want, but I just don't know
How to, go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my 
Fender's
, fingers
Manic depression is capturing my soul
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Woman so willing, the sweet cause in vain
You make love, you break love
It's all the same
When it's, when it's over, mama
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess
[Breakâ€”Guitar solo]
[Verse 3]
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and go on down
All the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around
In your kind of scene
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess
