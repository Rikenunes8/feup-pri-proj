[Verse 1]
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go
[Chorus]
'Cause teacher, there are things
That I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me "No"
So you think that you love me and know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go
[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I don't want to learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[Bridge]
So when you say that you need me, that you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong, let me go
[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try[Outro]
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try
