[Verse 1]
Open your eyes so you can see
Little girl, that you hurt me, yeah
Talking foolishly about lies
Never really knowing the reason why
Hey, hey
[Chorus]
How much did they cost? I don't know
But that's the price you'll have to pay
You see, what I feel is real
You want me to stay, I will
You've been loving me for years, baby, yeah
Ah, talking 'bout loving you
Hey, one of these good old days
Talking 'bout loving you
[Verse 2]
Time and time again, I wanted you to be my friend (My friend)
I'm gonna love you, 'til the end, baby (Baby)
Here's something else, little girl
Deep down inside (Down inside)
Oh, you know you caught me by surprise (Yeah)
Now I finally opened my eyes, baby
Hey, hey, yeah
[Chorus]
How much did they cost? I don't know
But that's the price you'll have to pay
Yeah, listen here
Hey, talking 'bout loving you
You haven't seen anything, girl (Yeah, baby)
One of these good old days
(One of these good old days)
After I get myself together, baby
Talking 'bout loving you
[Outro]
Oh, when you think about it
Let me think about it
One of these good old days
(One of these good old days)
I won't have to do anything but call your name, baby
(I'm gonna call your name)
I think I wanna call your name, I wanna call your name
Expecting your love (Expecting your love)
Hey, one of these good old days
I wanna call your name, I wanna call your name
Baby, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh-huh, baby
I say when you get right down
