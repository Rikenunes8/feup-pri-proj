[Intro]
(Now I'm down in it)
(Now I'm down in it)
[Verse 1]
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
Sometimes I don't believe them myself
And I decided I was never coming down
Just then, a tiny little dot caught my eye
It was just about too small to see
But I watched it way too long
It was pulling me down
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
[Verse 2]
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now?
I was swimming in the haze, now I crawl on the ground
And everything I never liked about you
Is kind of seeping into me
Try to laugh about it now
But isn't it funny how everything works out?
"I guess the joke's on me," she said
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
[Bridge]
I used to be so big and strong
I used to know my right from wrong
I used to never be afraid
I used to be somebody
I used to have something inside
Now just this hole that's open wide
I used to want it all
I used to be somebody[Verse 3]
I'll cross my heart, I'll hope to die
But the needle's already in my eye
And all the world's weight is on my back
And I don't even know why
And what I used to think was me
Is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye
And said goodbye
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it
I was up above it
(Now I'm down in it)[Outro]
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
