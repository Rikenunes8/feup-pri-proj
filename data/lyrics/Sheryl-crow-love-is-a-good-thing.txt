[Verse 1]
Watch out sister, watch out brother
Watch our children while they kill each other
With a gun they bought at Walmart discount stores
Welcome to the hallway, metal detector just been installed
Hey, isn't cops and robbers gettin' to be a big bore?
Mary, Mary quite contrary
Close your door now, it's much too scary
And you might see something you wish you hadn't seen
Out of sight, out of time, out of patience
And I'm out of my mind
Governor, tell me, what does it mean?
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna be a hippie 'cause life is so sweet
Well, good morning hate, yeah
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna rock and roll up and down the street
I've got a message, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing, yeah, yeah[Verse 2]
Politicians on a mission
Bring 'em up, bring 'em down for the good of the system
Well, we don't like the way you live your life
I got one thing I must express
We try our criminals in the press
Justice is a fadin' light
Mary, Mary quite contrary
Close your door now, it's much too scary
Yeah, you might see something you wish you hadn't seen
Out of sight, out of time, out of patience
And I'm out of my mind
Governor, tell me, what does it mean
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna be a hippy 'cause life is so sweet
Well, good morning hate, yeah
Dance children, dance to the beat
Wanna rock and roll up and down the street
I've got a message, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good thing
Love is a good thing
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good, love is a good
Love is a good[Outro]
