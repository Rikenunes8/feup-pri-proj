[Verse 1]
All the world just stopped now
So you say you don't wanna stay together anymore
Let me take a deep breath, babe
If you need me, me and Neil'll be
Hanging out with the Dream King
Neil said "Hi",
 
by the way
I don't believe you're leaving cause me and Charles
Manson like the same ice cream
I think it's that girl
[Pre-Chorus]
And I think they're pieces of me you've never seen
Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen, well
[Chorus]
All the world is all I am
The black of the blackest ocean
And the tear in your hand
All the world is
Dangling, dangling, dangling for me, darling
You don't know the power that you have
With that tear in your hand
Tear in your hand
[Bridge]
Maybe I ain't used to
Maybe's smashing in a cold room
Cutting my hands up
Every time I touch you
Maybe, maybe it's time to wave goodbye now
Time to wave goodbye now
[Verse 2]
Caught a ride with the moon
I know I know you well
Well, better than I used to
Haze all clouded up my mind
In the daze of why it could've never been
So you say and I say you know you're full of wish
And your "baby, baby, baby, babies"[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you they're pieces of me you've never seen
Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen, well
[Chorus]
All the world is all I am
The black of the blackest ocean
And the tear in your hand
All the world is
Dangling, dangling, dangling for me darling
You don't know the power that you have
With that tear in your hand
Tear in your hand
With that tear in your hand
