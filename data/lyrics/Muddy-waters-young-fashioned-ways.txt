[Verse]
I may be getting old
But I got young-fashioned ways
I may be getting old
But I got young-fashioned ways
But I'm going to love a good woman
The rest of my natural days
If my hair is turning grey
I know you think the way I feel
If my hair is turning grey
I know you think the way I feel
There may be snow up on the mountain
But there is fire down under the hill
I may be getting old
But I got young-fashioned ways
I may be getting old
But I got young-fashioned ways
I don't worry about no young one
There'll be no one to take my place
A young horse is fast
But an old horse knows what's going on
A young horse is fast
But an old horse knows what's going on
A young horse may win the race
But an old horse stays out so long
