[Verse 1]
I don't know why the world loves a forever love affair
(I'm just a freak)
Who loves a one-night thing, oh yeah
(A one night all night)
And after a long day of work all I wanna do is play around
(So I'm going out)
For a little bit of love
And a whole lotta getting down
Do you believe me? You gotta believe me
[Chorus]
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight, oh yeah
I need some love
I need some love tonight
[Verse 2]
People talk about my life and here's what they say
(It's incomplete)
It's too bad that they feel that way
(He sho' is crazy)
But I don't listen to any of them after five o'clock
Because the night is mine
And I don't wanna change anything 'cause I like what I got
Alright
[Chorus]
I've been working (Gotta work, work)
I've been all day working (I gotta work, work)
And I need somebody (Gotta work, work)
Said I need some
I need some love tonight, oh yeah
I need some love
I need some love tonight[Verse 3]
So don't give me a forever love affair, no don't you dare
(I like to freak)
To the one-night beat, oh yeah
(Again and again, yeah yeah)
I work hard every day so I do what I wanna do
That's why I'm steppin' out (Step)
To find me, somebody, to do what I wanna do
[Chorus]
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight, oh yeah
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight, oh yeahI've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight, oh yeah
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight
