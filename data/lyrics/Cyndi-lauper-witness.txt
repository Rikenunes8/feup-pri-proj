[Verse 1]
You're sorry now
And you'll change somehow
I am what you need to get out
[Chorus]
But I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm crawling back
I'm searching the right track
Standing at last, I'm sure
[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
[Break]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh,-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 3]
Jailbird, chained to walk
How you used to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
But the melody
None at all, my love
[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
And I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness[Break]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh,-oh-oh-oh
Witness
Witness
Yeah, yeah
Ooh
[Chorus]
Please, let me out this time
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be, no
Don't wanna be a witness
I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be, oh
Don't wanna be a witness
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh,-oh-oh-oh
Witness
