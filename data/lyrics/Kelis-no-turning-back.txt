[Intro: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
Uh, uh, uh uh uh
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh uh uh
Uh-huh, yeah
Come on, uh, said, uh uh uh
Uh-huh, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, uh
Yeah
 (Yeah), what (Yeah) what (Yeah) what (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
You can search around the world for different people
For a thing called love, mhm, mhm
And you'll return with stories on how they perceive you
It just wasn't love
Your friends will say how they often see it
(
But what
) They ain't talkin' 'bout love
(They ain't talkin' 'bout love, baby)
(
Sing it, baby
)
Just go inside and figure many that don't believe it (
Uh uh
)
'Cause it just ain't love
Love love, love love, love love love
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
When in love with someone
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it
If it's bright as the sun (
Talk to me, baby
)
There's no turning back
(
Yeah, second verse, what, what, what
)[Verse 2: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
I don't need your lavish lifestyle to please me
(
Why?
) 'Cause it just ain't love
If you notice, kings and queens divorce so easy
'Cause it just ain't love
(
Sing it, baby; sing, sing it, baby
)
The world could change if starving mouths were eating
But there is no love (
That's so true, what
)
When your heart is starving, now's the time to feed it
I'm rich with love
When you love someone
(
Come on, come on
)
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
When in love with someone (
What?
)
When he leaves you can still feel it (
Huh?
)
Since you feel they're the one
Just close your eyes and you can still see it (
Okay, yeah
)
If it's bright as the sun (
What?
)
There's no turning back
(
Again, again
)
When in love with someone (
What
)
When he leaves you can still feel it (
Okay
)
Since you feel they're the one (
What
)
Just close your eyes and you can still see it (
Okay
)
If it's bright as the sun (
Then what, baby, huh?
)
There's no turning back (
Okay, what
)[Bridge: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
You (
Uh
) can't (
Uh
) deny (
Uh, uh
)
You can't deny (You can't deny)
When you're open wide (When you're open wide) (
Yeah
)
And what you're feeling inside (What you're feeling inside)
Is an all-time high (Is an all-time high)
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
When in love with someone (
What
)
When he leaves you can still feel it
Since you feel they're the one (
What
)
Just close your eyes and you can still see it (
Okay
)
If it's bright as the sun (
Sing it to me, baby; sing it to me
)
There's no turning back (
Ha ha, come on, uh, uh, uh uh uh
)
[Bridge: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
You can't deny (You can't deny) (
Come on
)
When you're open wide (When you're open wide)
And what you're feeling inside (What you're feeling inside)
(
Sing it, baby; sing it, baby come on
)
Is an all-time high (Is an all-time high)
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
When in love with someone (
What
)
When he leaves you can still feel it (
I feel you
)
Since you feel they're the one (
What
)
Just close your eyes and you can still see it (
I see it, baby
)
If it's bright as the sun (
Brighter than ever, come on
)
There's no turning back[Outro: Pharrell]
There's no turning back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's us, y'all
