Before you left your garrison
You'd had a drink, maybe two
You don't remember Paris, hon
But it remembers you
It's true, we flew to Paris, dear
Aboard an Army jet
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
You said I was terrific, it
Meant zilch to you, ah but I
Have our marriage certificate
And I'll keep it 'til I die
You were an Army officer
And I just a Rockette
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
No rose conveyed your sentiments
Not even a petunia
But you've got vague presentiments
And I've got little Junior
You said, "Nobody loves me"
And I said, "Wanna bet?"
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
