[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
[Verse 1]
Last time I saw her alive
She was wavin', wavin' bye bye
She was contemplating suicide
Now she's lying in a bottle of Formaldehyde
And oh, I just don't know
Why I can't let her go
Oh, I just don't know
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
[Verse 2]
Last time I saw her
She was going to the wash and dry
She was outside hitchin' a ride
Now she's lying in a bottle of Formaldehyde
And oh, I just don't know
Why I can't let her go
Oh, I just don't know
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
Hey, hey, hey, why is it always this way?
