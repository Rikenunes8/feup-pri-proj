[Guitar Intro: Carl Wilson]
[Verse 1: Mike Love]
There she goes she ran in her room
She'll probably stay in there the rest of the day
It sounds like it must have been something you said
You know she's awful used to getting her way
[Chorus 1: Brian Wilson, 
Group
]
Why don't you kiss her 
(Why don't you kiss her)
And while you kiss her 
(Tell her you miss her)
Why don't you treat her 
(Why don't you treat her)
Treat her 
nice
[Chorus 2: Group]
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
[Verse 2: Mike Love]
You know she digs you and thinks you're a real groovy guy
But yet I'm not sure that I feel the same
We both know that you've been making her cry
I hope you don't think it's some kind of game
[Chorus 1: Brian Wilson, 
Group
]
Why don't you love her 
(Why don't you love her)
Like her big brother 
(Like her big brother)
Why don't you tell her 
(Why don't you tell her)
Tell her you're 
sorry
[Chorus 2: Group]
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
[Instrumental]
[Outro: Group, 
Brian Wilson
]
Don't hurt my little sister 
(Why don't you love her)
Don't hurt my little sister 
(Like a big brother)
Don't hurt my little sister
