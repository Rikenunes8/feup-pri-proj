[Verse]
Ah, when I'm done mess again
Lord, and my baby don't understand
Well I know, ah, child
That the sun, sun gonna shine again, shine again
Well you say that you'll always be mine
Hee, lawdy, would always treat me kind
But still I know, Lord
That the sun, sun gonna shine again, shine again
Yes, Lord, baby
Well my skies are so cloudy grey
Oh, Lord, baby since you, since you been away
Ah, but I know, Lord
That the sun, sun gonna shine again, yea shine again
Well, you're gonna be sorry, baby, for what you've done
Hee, lawdy, and I'll be far away havin' so much fun
Ahh, 'cause I know, Lord
That the sun, sun gonna shine again
