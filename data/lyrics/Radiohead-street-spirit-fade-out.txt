[Verse 1]
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out
[Verse 2]
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out again
[Bridge]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
[Verse 3]
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out again
[Outro]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Immerse your soul in love (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh)
Immerse your soul in love (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh)
