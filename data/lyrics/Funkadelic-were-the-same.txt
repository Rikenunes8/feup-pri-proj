La da da da-da
Ah, la da da, la da da da-da
Just because it's said
That a man is not
Supposed to cry (supposed to cry)
Just because we conceal
What we feel
When we hurt deep down inside
Ohh, why don't they realize
That it's just a disguise
To hide the way that we feel
We hurt too
This is true
Why don't they
See through this
Pretending happiness
There are really certainty?
And when they say good bye
We will drown only inside
By those same little tears
Ohh, they know this is true
That
He made me and he made you
This is true
We hurt too
We hurt too
There is no difference
We're just like you
It's the same laughing and crying
Loving and dying
So remember every day
As you pass along life's way
What I said to you
That because you see no tears
It's not happiness I feel
When you say we're through
Ohh, sugar it's hard
That you find
With more faith than you did mine?
I feel really lost you??
Th?
This is true
We hurt too
This is true
