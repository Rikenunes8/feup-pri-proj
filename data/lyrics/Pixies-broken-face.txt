[Intro]
I got a broken face
I got a...
I got a broken face, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooo!
I got a broken face
[Chorus]
I got a broken face
I got a broken face
[Verse 1]
There was this boy who had two children with his sisters
Who were his daughters, who were his favorite lovers
[Pre-Chorus]
I got no lips, I got no tongue
Where there were eyes, there's only space
I got no lips, I got no tongue
[Chorus 1]
I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh!
I got a broken face
[Verse 2]
There was this man who smashed his brain in little pieces
And then they drilled holes and then they put 'em back in there
[Pre-Chorus]
I got no lips, I got no tongue
Where there were eyes there's only space
I got no lips, I got no tongue
[Chorus 1]
I got a broken face, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh!
I got a broken face[Verse 3]
The little thing who does my laundry speaks no English
But if you saw her, you'd say "Hey, isn't she lovely?''
[Pre-Chorus]
I got no lips, I got no tongue
Where there were eyes there's only space
I got no lips, I got no tongue
