[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
"Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"
[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no
[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?
[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no[Outro]
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Keep thinking
