[Chorus 1][x2]
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick
[Chorus 2]
People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
[Chorus 3]
Come and tell me you love me
She didn't want to be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3]
[Chorus 1][x2]
