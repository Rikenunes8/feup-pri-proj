[Verse 1: Mike Love]
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her
A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring
[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Love]
It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long
[Chorus: Mike Love]
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
[Verse 2: Mike Love]
Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well, you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well, I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were
[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Love]
She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long
[Chorus: Mike Love]
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
[Chorus: Mike Love]
Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
