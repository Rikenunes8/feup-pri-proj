[Verse 1]
Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much?
Sweet, sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender
[Chorus]
Like a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is love
[Verse 2]
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing
[Chorus]
Yes a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love
[Bridge]
And if you're warm and tender
I'll kiss you, return to sender, please surrender
[Outro]
Bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is love
