[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & 
Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
 (
Yo
)
[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean & 
Lauryn Hill
]
Now that I escape, sleepwalk awake
 (
Yeah
)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates
, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world)
, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & 
Wyclef Jean
]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
 (
Yo, yo, yo
, yo)[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill & 
Wyclef Jean
]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Eliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo,
 I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (
Ha
)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these styles I got, oh, baby
Hey, baby, 'cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh, baby
Hey, baby, you can't hide from the block, oh, no
[Verse 3: Pras, 
Pras & Lauryn Hill
]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber (Drop bombs)
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from 
Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & 
Wyclef Jean
]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (
Ayo, nobody move
)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide (
Ayo, nobody move
)
Gonna find you and make you want me
 (
Come on

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (
You know theâ€”

Gonna find you and take it slowly
 (
You know

Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
