[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
I met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet
[Chorus]
I'm talking 'bout you
Nobody but you
Yeah, I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you
[Verse 2]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
I tell you now, she looks so good
Got so much skills, such a beautiful will
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood
[Chorus]
I'm talking 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on and give me a cue
So I can get a message to you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I asked if she
Promised someday she will be my bride
[Chorus]
I'm talking 'bout you
I do mean you
Nobody but you
Come on, let me get a message through
