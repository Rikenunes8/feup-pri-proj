[Verse 1]
I dropped my anchor in the dead of night
I packed my suitcase and threw it away
I fell asleep in the funeral fire
I gave my clothes to the policeman
[Chorus]
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
[Verse 2]
Shooting venom at the passers-by
Hijackers tie the heavens down
I put my eyes in a paper bag
I'm spinning 'round like a gambling wheel
[Chorus]
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
[Verse 3]
I dropped my anchor in the dead of night
I packed my suitcase and threw it away
I fell asleep in the funeral fire
I gave my clothes to the policeman
[Chorus]
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
