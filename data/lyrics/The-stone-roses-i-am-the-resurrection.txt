[Verse 1]
Down down, you bring me down
I hear you knocking down my door and I can't sleep at night
Your face, it has no place
No room for you inside my house I need to be alone
[Chorus]
Don't waste your words
I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been
Or what you plan to do
[Verse 2]
Turn turn, I wish you'd learn
There's a time and place for everything, I've got to get it through
Cut loose, 'cause you're no use
I couldn't stand another second in your company
[Chorus]
Don't waste your words
I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been
Or what you plan to do
[Verse 3]
Stone me, why can't you see
You're a no-one nowhere washed up baby who'd look better dead?
Your tongue is far too long
I don't like the way it sucks and slurps upon my every word
[Chorus]
Don't waste your words
I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been
Or what you plan to do
[Post-Chorus]
I am the resurrection and I am the life
I couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as I'd like
I am the resurrection and I am the life
I couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as I'd like[Instrumental Outro]
