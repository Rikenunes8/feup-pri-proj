[Verse 1]
Here’s a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands (What’s in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
Surviving if he can (Surviving if he can)
[Refrain]
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow (Hi-high)
[Chorus 1]
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
[Interlude]
(Hi-high, hi-high, hi-high)
[Verse 2]
Here’s a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands (What’s in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
Surviving if he can (But only if he can)
[Refrain]
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow (Hi-high)
[Chorus 2]
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (Pride)
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow (Hi-high)
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow (Hi-high)
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
