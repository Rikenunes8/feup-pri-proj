{Funeral for a Friend}
[Instrumental]
{Love Lies Bleeding}
[Verse 1]
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm 
sorry, honey
, 
if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"
[Chorus]
And 
love lies bleedin'
 in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
[Verse 2]
I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the 
burnin' hoops of fire
 that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow
[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands[Outro]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
