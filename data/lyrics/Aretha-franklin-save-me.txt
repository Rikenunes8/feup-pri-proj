[Chorus]
Save me, somebody save me
Save me, somebody save me, yeah
[Verse 1]
Promised myself after the first romance
I wouldn't give you a second chance
They say if you seek, you're sure to find
But the closer I get to you, baby
You drive me stone outta my mind
[Chorus]
Save me oh, yeah
Save me, yeah yeah
[Verse 2]
Those who love always give the most
We're crying together from coast to coast
Love leaves us cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours, unjustified
[Chorus]
Begging you to, save me
Yeah, I need somebody to save me, yeah, hey hey hey
[Verse 3]
Your love said you needed me
You abused my love, set me free
You didn't need, you didn't want me
Somebody help me, this man wants to taunt me
I'm begging you to, oh
[Chorus]
Save me, yeah
Please save me
[Verse 4]
Calling the Caped Crusader, Green Hornet, Kato, too
I'm in so much trouble I don't know what to do
If you think anything about me[Outro]
Save me, oh yeah, yeah, come on
I just said, save me, baby, come on
Save me, save me
Oh, save me
Oh, save me
