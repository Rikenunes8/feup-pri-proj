Oh
, 
Lord
, don't let 'em shoot us
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em stab us
Oh, Lord, no more swastikas
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em tar and feather us!
[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, no more Ku Klux Klan
Name me someone who's ridiculous, Dannie
Governor Faubus!
Why is he so sick and ridiculous?
He won't permit integrated schools
Then he's a fool!
Boo!
 Nazi Fascist supremists!
Boo! Ku Klux Klan (With your Jim Crow plan)
[Chorus]
Name me a handful that's ridiculous, Dannie Richmond
Bilbo, Thomas, Faubus, Russel, 
Rockefeller
, Byrd, 
Eisenhower
Why are they so sick and ridiculous?
Two, four, six, eight:
They brainwash and teach you hate
H-E-L-L-O, Hello
Boo! Nazi Fascist supremists!
Boo! Ku Klux Klan (With your Jim Crow plan)
[Chorus]
Name me a handful that's ridiculous, Dannie Richmond
Bilbo, Thomas, Faubus, Russel, 
Rockefeller
, Byrd, 
Eisenhower
Why are they so sick and ridiculous?
Two, four, six, eight:
They brainwash and teach you hate
