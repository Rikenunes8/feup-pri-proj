[Verse 1]
Kashka from Baghdad
Lives in sin, they say
With another man
But no one knows who
[Verse 2]
Old friends never call there
Some wonder if life's
Inside at all
If there's life inside at all
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But we know the lady who rents the room
She catches them calling Ã  la lune
[Chorus]
At night (Watching every night)
They're seen (Don't you know they're seen?)
Laughing (Won't you let me laugh?)
Loving (Let me in your love)
They know (They know)
The way (The way)
To be
Happy[Verse 3]
They never go for walks
Maybe it's because
The moon's not bright enough
There's light in love, you see
[Verse 4]
I watch their shadows
Tall and slim
In the window opposite
I long to be with them
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause when all the alley-cats come out
I can hear music from Kashka's house
[Chorus]
At night (Watching every night)
They're seen (Don't you know they're seen?)
Laughing (Won't you let me laugh?)
Loving (Let me in your love)
They know (They know)
The way (The way)
To be
Happy[Outro]
Watching every night
Don't you know they're seen?
Won't you let me laugh?
Let me in your love
Watching every night
Don't you know they're seen?
Won't you let me laugh?
Let me in your love
Watching every night
Don't you know they're seen?
Won't you let me laugh?
Let me in your love
Watching every night
Don't you know they're seen?
Won't you let me laugh?
