[Verse 1]
I don't want you to, to be no slave
I don't want you to, to work all day
I don't want you sad and blue
I just want to make love to you
Love to you
[Verse 2]
I don't want you to, to wash my clothes
I don't want you to, to keep me at home
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you
Love to you
Love to you
Make love to you
[Guitar solo]
[Bridge]
I can tell by the way you switch and walk
I can see by the way you baby talk
I can know by the way you treat your man
That I could love you, babe, until it's a cryin' shame
[Verse 3]
I don't want you to, to cook my bread
I don't want you to, to make my bed
I don't want you because I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you
Wanna make love to you
Make love to you
Yes I wanna make love to you
Make love to you
Oh yes baby makе love to you
Make love to you
Oh I wanna hold you in my arms
Makе love to you
Make love to you
Make love to you
