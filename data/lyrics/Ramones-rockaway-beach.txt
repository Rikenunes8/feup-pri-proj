[Verse 1]
Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum
The sun is out and I want some
It's not hard, not far to reach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
Up on the roof, out on the street
Down in the playground the hot concrete
Bus ride is too slow
They blast out the disco on the radio
[Chorus]
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
[Bridge]
It's not hard, not far to reach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
It's not hard, not far to reach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
[Verse 2]
Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum
The sun is out and I want some
It's not hard, not far to reach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
Up on the roof, out on the street
Down in the playground the hot concrete
Bus ride is too slow
They blast out the disco on the radio
[Chorus]
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
[Chorus]
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
Rock rock Rockaway Beach
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach
