[Verse 1]
You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
My purity you stole
[Pre-Chorus]
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat, and lies, lies, lies
[Chorus]
It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain
It gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin
[Verse 2]
You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
While I get what I deserve
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced
To be defaced
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything
Well, then, just give me a taste
[Chorus]
It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain
It gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin[Verse 1]
You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
And my purity you stole
[Pre-Chorus]
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat and lies, lies, lies
[Chorus]
It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain
It gets under my skin
Within, take in
Well, my sin, it comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain
It gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin
