[Verse]
Last night, we had a hell-raising time
Nippin' on tequila and suckin' on a lime
Sunrise chased the good times away
And good morning would have been the wrong thing to say
'Cause the pounding in the top of my head
Hey, didn't leave me any too soon
I can't say we've had a good morning
But babe, it's been a great afternoon
[Verse]
Well, you nursed me through the morning while I was really down
Then one rowdy afternooner got me up and around
Yes, last night we had one hell-raising time
But today won't be forgotten too soon
I can't say we've had a good morning
Oh but babe, it's been a great afternoon
[Verse]
Well, you nursed me through the morning while I was really down
Then one rowdy afternooner got me up and around
Yes, last night we had one hell-raising time
But today won't be forgotten too soon
I can't say we've had a good morning
But dang, it's been a great afternoon
