"Are We The Waiting"
]
[Verse 1]
Starry nights, city lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found, city bound in my dreams
[Chorus 1]
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
[Verse 2]
Forget me nots and second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie
[Chorus 2]
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

"St. Jimmy"
]
[Intro]
St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette
He's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1,2- 1,2,3,4![Verse 1]
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves, and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment
[Chorus]
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
[Verse 2]
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized
[Chorus]
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
[Ad Libs]
Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
St. Jimmy
[Middle Eight]
My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun
I'm the one that's from the way outside, now
I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime, now
I'd really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, old boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found
It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy
And that's my name
And don't wear it out!
