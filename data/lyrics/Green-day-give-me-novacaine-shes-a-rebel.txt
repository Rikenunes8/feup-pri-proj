"Give Me Novacaine"
]
[Verse 1]
Take away the sensation inside
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
I can’t take this feeling anymore
[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
[Verse 2]
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling, that’s alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why
[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
[Ad Lib]
Oh Novacaine
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine[
"She's A Rebel"
]
[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she’s a saint
She’s the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She’s a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
[Verse 1]
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she’s holding on my heart like a hand grenade
[Verse 2]
Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody
[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
[Outro]
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous
