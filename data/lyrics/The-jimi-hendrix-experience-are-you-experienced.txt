[Verse 1]
If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands, and then we'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea
[Chorus]
But first, are you experienced?
Or have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
[Verse 2]
I know, I know you probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world
Are you trying to prove that
You're made out of gold and, uh, can't be sold?
[Chorus]
So uh, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Ah, let me prove it to you
[Guitar Solo][Verse 3]
Trumpets and violins I can, uh, hear in the distance
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will, haha
If you just take hold of my hand
[Chorus]
Oh, but are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
[Outro]
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful
