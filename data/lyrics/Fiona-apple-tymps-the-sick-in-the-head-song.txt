[Verse 1]
Those boon times went bust
, 
my feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted, it's just rust
And that signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering
[Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it
[Verse 2]
I knew that to keep in touch, would do me 
deep in dutch
Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, it's just mush
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing
I should have no trouble now to keep from following
[Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it
[Verse 3]
Those boon times went bust
, 
my feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted, it's just rust
And that signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering
[Modified Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it
