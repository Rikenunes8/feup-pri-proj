[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
[Verse 1]
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do
[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do
(Ow!)
[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you
[Bridge]
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for mе, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll bе too late[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
[Post-Chorus]
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waitin' on you
[Outro]
Fuck you
