[Chorus]
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (Where you goin', child?)
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood (Where you goin' now?)
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood
[Verse 1]
He's waited at bus stops all his life
He's been in and out of those spaces
Seein' eyes that spoke to him
From sad and empty places
Sad and empty places
[Chorus]
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood (Where you goin' now? What you doin', child?)
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (Where you goin' now?)
[Verse 2]
You know he's gonna be dressed to kill
He's gonna find some brand new thrills
Whatever he's been looking for, tell him that there's so much more
In Hollywood
Hollywood
[Chorus]
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood (What you doin' now? What you doin', child?)
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (What you doin'?)
[Bridge]
Painted faces, sun-burnt skin
Fixed expressions, smiles worn thin
Caught in the blinkin' neon of Hollywood
Bending battles, maneuvering schemes
False expressions, washed up dreams
Everybody makes believe
In Hollywood
Hollywood (Woah, child)[Chorus]
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (What you doin' now?)
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood (What you been doin'?)
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (I said)
[Outro]
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
He's bussin' it to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood (Uh-huh)
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (I said)
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
He's bussin' it to Hollywood (Hollywood)
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood (Hollywood)
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood (To Hollywood)
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood (Hollywood)
