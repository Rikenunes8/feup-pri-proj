The night was cold and the wind was howling
I was awaken by the sound of hoof beats pounding
Outside the window on the ground, my old hound dog was growling

Grey Riders flew across my lawn
I looked again and they all were gone
That voice was calling and it cut through the night
"Come on boys, let her go"
Up on a hill they rode in one long column
They were freezing in the chill of the new day dawning
Their hair long and grey, they had just one voice calling

Grey Riders on the morning sky
The sun made diamonds of their road-weary eyes
That voice was calling and it cut through the night
"Come on boys, let her go"


Grey Riders on the morning sky
The sun made diamonds of their road-weary eyes
That voice was calling and it cut through the night
"Come on boys, let her go"

The night was cold and the rain came down
Outside the window, on the ground my old hound dog was ah-woo!
I was awakened by the sound of hoof beats pounding

Grey Riders flew across my lawn
I looked again and they all were gone
That voice was calling and it cut through the night
"Come on boys, let her go"
