[Verse 1]
Monty, this seems strange to me
The movies had that movie thing
But nonsense has a welcome ring
And heroes don't come easily
Now, nonsense isn't new to me
I know my head, I know my feet
But mischief knocked me in the knees
So, just let go
Just let go
I saw the ocean meet the man
I saw you buried in the sand
A friend was there to hold your hand
Said, walk on by
So, I went walking through the street
I saw you strung up in a tree
A woman knelt there said to me
Said, hold your tongue
Hold your tongue
[Chorus]
You don't owe me anything
You don't want this sympathy (Waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath (Waste your breath)
For the silver screen
[Verse 2]
That nonsense doesn't mean a thing
They tried to bust you in a sting
But virtue isn't everything
So, don't waste time
Now, here's a rhyme that you can steal
Put this on your reel to reel
Mischief threw a rotten deal
Monty's laying low
He is laying low
Just let go
Just let go
[Chorus]
You don't owe me anything
You don't want this sympathy (Waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath (Waste your breath)
Monty, this seems strange to me
