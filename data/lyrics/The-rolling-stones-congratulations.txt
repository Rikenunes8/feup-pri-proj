[Verse 1]
Congratulations
Congratulations
Well done, my friend
You've done it again
You've gone and broken another heart
Yeah, you've torn it apart
[Verse 2]
You've done it before
Hope to do it some more
You've got it down to a fine art
[Bridge]
Remember the first time
You tried to do it to me
My girl won't fall
Just wait and see, just wait and see
[Verse 3]
Congratulations
Congratulations
You've gone and broken another heart
Yeah, you've torn me apart
