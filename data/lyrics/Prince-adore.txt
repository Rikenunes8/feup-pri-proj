[Intro]
Ohhhh, baby, ohhh
[Chorus]
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me
[Verse 1]
From the first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you
I was rappin' 'till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
[Chorus]
That's why
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me[Verse 2]
When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride--
Well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare
To your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
I'm just tryin' to say
[Chorus]
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
You own my heart, you own my mind
I truly adore you
I truly adore you, darlin'
Adore you
You don't know what you mean to me, baby
Baby, baby
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
Adore you[Breakdown]
Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me
Without you there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is too weak to define how much I adore
You child, you child
The last words you hear
Be with me darlin' til the end of all time
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body
I'll give you my time
For all time I am with you
[Outro]
You are with me
You are with me
