[Verse 1]
I can't feel this way much longer expecting to survive
With all these hidden innuendos just waiting to arrive
It's such a wavy midnight and you slip into insane
Electric angel rock and roller, I hear what you're playin'
[Chorus]
It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
[Verse 2]
Substitution, mass confusion, clouds inside your head
Involving all my energies until you visited
With your eyes of porcelain and of blue
They shock me into sense
You think you're so illustrious, you call yourself intense
[Chorus]
It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love-ov-ov-ove
[Synthesizer solo]
[Verse 2]
Substitution, mass confusion, clouds inside your head
Were fogging all my energies until you visited
Oh, with your eyes of porcelain and of blue
They shock me into sense
You think you're so illustrious, you call yourself intense
[Chorus]
It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love[Guitar outro]
