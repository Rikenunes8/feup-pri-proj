[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path, and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out
[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale, up for sale
[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
Now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home, go home, go home
[Outro]
Pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Mm, pale shadow of a woman
Mm, black widow
Mm, pale shadow, she's a dragon
Dust woman, woman, woman
