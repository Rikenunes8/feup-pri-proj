[Verse 1]
Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow?
Oh, I love your roman nose
The way you curl your toes, baby
Make me feel so mellow
[Verse 2]
It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain
[Chorus]
Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
[Verse 3]
Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed
[Verse 4]
And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right[Chorus]
Oh, I make you mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
[Electric Violin Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
Oh! You make me mellow
Oh! You make me mellow
Rocking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
