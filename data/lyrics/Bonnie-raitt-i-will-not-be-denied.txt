A true love story is hard to find
Can't get no rest, got no peace of mind
You say you gave your heart to me
You put me down you set me free
You said you're deadly, everybody said you was deadly
I guess you know he is because, deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Always takes you by surprise
You said you was the only one
Coming on me and ruining my fun
Leave me setting at home all alone
Waitin' on your call by the telephone
You said you're deadly, everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always was deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried, but you just can't get enough
So you lied and lied and lied and lied
I will not be denied, I'm gonna plant a seed
I will not be denied, of the man and the love I need
Said you're deadly, everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you are because, deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Always takes you by surpriseIt's a sad situation when yes its true
I can say it baby I'm through with you
It's over now and in the past
Gonna find me a man with a love that'll last
You know he's deadly, everybody said you were deadly
Guess you know you always been deadly
Comes in every shape and size, deadly
Finally made me realize
That I tried and tried, but you just couldn't get enough
And so you lied and lied and lied and lied
And I will not be denied, will not be denied
Of the love I'll be there, will not be denied
I said I will not be, will not be denied
No not be denied I, I will not be denied
I tell it one more time, will not be yeah, will not be denied
Will not be denied, will not be denied
