[Verse 1]
On A Monday I Was Arrested (Uh Huh)
On A Tuesday They Locked Me In The Jail (Oh Boy)
On A Wednesday My Trial Was Attested
On A Thursday They Said Guilty And The Judge's Gavel Fell
[Chorus]
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down
[Verse 2]
On A Monday My Momma Come To See Me
On A Tuesday They Caught Me With A File
On A Wednesday I'm Down In Solitary
On A Thursday I Start On Bread And Water For A While
[Chorus]
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down
[Chorus]
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down
