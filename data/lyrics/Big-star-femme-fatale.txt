Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up to just put you down
What a clown
[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows
(Elle est une femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(Elle est une femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(Elle est une femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
You're written in her book
You're number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
Yes, it true
[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows
(Elle est une femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(Elle est une femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(Elle est une femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
'Cause everybody knows
(Elle est une femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(Elle est une femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(Elle est une femme fatale)
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
