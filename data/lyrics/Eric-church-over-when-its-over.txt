[Chorus]
It's over when it's over
Ain't it, baby, ain't it?
Rips ya like a dagger
Can't it baby, Can't it
Wish we could do it over
Damn it, baby, Damn it
We had it in the air, we just couldn't land it
[Verse 1]
It's the first snap of the last straw
Where regrets outlast the alcohol
It's a cold sweat, in an empty bed
And dreams are like a knife
When you're hanging by a thread
Ain't no "Maybe we can make it if we just play the right cards"
[Chorus]
It's over when it's over
Ain't it, baby, ain't it?
Rips ya like a dagger
Can't it baby, Can't it
Wish we could do it over
Damn it, baby, Damn it
We had it in the air, we just couldn't land it
[Verse 2]
It's a white flag
It's a stop sign
It's the last long drag, on a Marlboro light
It's a long night, beating up the past
Know when the first lie, is going to hit you back
This ain't no gone for good drill
Or no goodbye false alarm, it's over
Yeah it's over[x2]
There ain't no better way
We could make it work
It's a blank page
When you're outta words
Yeah it's a flat line
It's a heart attack
Yeah it's too far gone, to be shocked back
It's a one way, with nowhere to turn
It's a no brakes, baby, crash and burn
Ain't no map going to ever bring us back
From where we are[Chorus]
It's over when it's over
Ain't it, baby, ain't it?
Rips ya like a dagger
Can't it baby, Can't it
Wish we could do it over
Damn it, baby, Damn it
We had it in the air, we just couldn't land it
