[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I thought that I knew about 'em
Thought that they would never do me wrong
Well, well they smile in your face
When all the time they want to take your place
Them backstabbers
[Pre-Chorus]
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come
Well, don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
[Verse 2: T-Boz & Chilli]
I thought that I knew about 'em
The only ones that really cared for me
Oh yeah (No, no, no)
But they shouldn't be that way
Only down for as long as
You can give security
[Pre-Chorus: T-Boz]
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come, well
Don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
Goodbye, goodbye
To all the fake people in my life (In my life)
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now (You gotta be on your way, hey yeah)
You better think twice (Oh no)
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
[Outro]
Uh oh
You got a case of the fake people
Oh, oh
Case of the fake people
Yeah
Got a case of the fake people
(Oh, oh, oh, why)
Goodbye, goodbye
To all the fake people in my life
(Case of the fake people)
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
(Case of the fake people)
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
(Case of the fake people)
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
(Case of the fake people)
Goodbye, goodbye
Case of the fake people
Goodbye, goodbye
To all the fake people in my life
Case of the fake people
Oh, oh
