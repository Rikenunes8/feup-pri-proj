[Intro]
Cool
Yeah
Uh-uh, yeah
[Verse 1]
You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?
And you'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax
[Chorus 1]
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
[Chorus 2]
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you
[Verse 2]
Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, max[Chorus 1]
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
No, no, no
[Chorus 2]
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you
[Bridge]
Don't be stupid
My baby
[Chorus 2]
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you
[Chorus 1]
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible, impossible
Oh, no, no, no[Outro]
Don't be, don't be, don't be, baby
Don't be ridiculous
No, no
Oh, don't be stupid
