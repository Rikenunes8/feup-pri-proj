[Verse 1: Thom Yorke]
Can you hear them?
The helicopters?
I'm in New York
No need for words now
We sit in silence
You look me
In the eye directly
You met me
I think it's Wednesday
The evening
The mess we're in and
[Chorus: PJ Harvey]
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
[Verse 2: Thom Yorke]
Night and day
I dream of
Making love
To you now baby
Love-making
On-screen
Impossible dream
And I have seen
The sunrise
Over the river
The freeway
Reminding
Of this mess we're in and
[Chorus: PJ Harvey]
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
[Bridge: 
PJ Harvey
 & Thom Yorke / 
Together
]
What were you wanting?
What was it you wanted?
I just wanna say
I just wanna say
Don’t ever change
Don’t ever change now, baby
And thank you
And thank you
I don’t think we will meet again
I don’t think we will meet again
And you must leave now
And you must leave now
Before the sun rises over the skyscrapers
Before the sunrise above skyscrapers
And the city landscape comes into being
Sweat on my skin
The city
Oh, this mess we’re in[Chorus: PJ Harvey]
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
