Whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass, I'm pretty handy
I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine

So, join me for a drink, boys
We're gonna make a big noise
So, don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me

I'm dizzy, drunk and fighting
On tequila, white lightnin'
Yes, my glass is gettin' shorter
On whiskey, ice and water

Yeah, so come on, have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So, don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me tonight
Get stoned
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Come on

Going another round
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swig
Have another drink
Gonna drink you dry
Gonna get me high
Come on, all the boys make a noise
Have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Ah, have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink
On me
