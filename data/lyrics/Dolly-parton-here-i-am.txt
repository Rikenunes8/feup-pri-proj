[Verse 1]
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a love that's true
Need someone to stand by you
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
[Chorus]
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been looking for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
[Verse 2]
My world is such an empty place
I need someone to fill the space
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Because I've got so much love to give
I need someone to share it with
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
[Chorus]
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been looking for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
[Outro]
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
