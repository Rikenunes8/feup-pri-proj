[Verse 1]
Well, I'm standing here freezing
Inside your golden garden
I got my ladder leaned
Up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned
To run away together
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me...
[Chorus]
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, hey
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
Girl, what you're talking 'bout?
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta make sure it's right
So until tomorrow, goodnight
Oh, what a drag
[Verse 2]
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you
Hang me up this way?
On the phone you said you wanted
To run off with me today
Now I'm standing here
Like some turned-down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter
From the mixed-up mind of you
And you keep telling me, that, uh...
[Chorus]
I think we better wait till tomorrow
What you're talking 'bout?
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
No, can't wait that long
(I think we better wait 'til tomorrow)
Oh, no
Gotta make sure it's right
Until tomorrow, goodnight, oh no
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit here
[Verse 3]
Oh, Dolly Mae girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning
From your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody
Pointing something from a tree?
Click, bang!
What a hang
Your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...[Chorus]
We don't have to wait till tomorrow, hey!
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
What'd you say?
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
It must not have been right
So forever, goodnight
Listen at you
[Outro]
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Ah, do I have to wait? Don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
It's a drag on my part
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, uh, hmm, oh no
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait, yeah
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Oh no, I won't be around tomorrow, yeah!
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Bye, bye bye!
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Oh, what a mix up
Crazy, ah!
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
