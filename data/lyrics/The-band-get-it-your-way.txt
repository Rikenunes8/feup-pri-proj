All this time
I always thought that I could read your mind
But you were busy gettin' off online
Now I wonder where your secrets hide
You think you know someone
I never knew you were a loaded gun
Now there's nothin' that could be undone
You're losing everybody one by one, one by one

You said you're sorry, but you didn't mean it
Don't lie to me 'cause I've already seen it
I don't believe who you act like you arе anymore
I'm holdin' on (I don't wanna let go)
For another еscape (I don't know what to say)
You're movin' on (And I'm lookin' at you like)
You're not the same (I guess you always get it your way)
You say it's not your fault (You don't know who to blame)
You're just this way (You keep runnin' from yourself now)
And after all (I guess you'll always get it your way)
And after all (I guess you'll always get it your way)

I can't help reminiscin' all the things I felt
Even if you can only think about yourself
You only love yourself, at least you love yourself

You said you're sorry, but you didn't mean it
Don't lie to me 'cause I've already seen it
I don't believe who you act like you are anymore, anymore

I'm holdin' on (I don't wanna let go)
For another escape (I don't know what to say)
You're movin' on (And I'm lookin' at you like)
You're not the same (I guess you always get it your way)
You say it's not your fault (You don't know who to blame)
You're just this way (You keep runnin' from yourself now)
And after all (I guess you'll always get it your way)
And after all (I guess you'll always get it your way)

Always get it your way
Always get it your way (You say it's not your fault)
Get it your way, always get it your way (You're just this way)
Get it your way, always get it your way (And after all)
Get it your way, always get it your way (And after all)
Get it your way, always get it your way
