[Verse 1]
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
[Verse 2]
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide
[Chorus]
Always lived, very quiet life
I have never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
[Verse 1]
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
[Chorus]
Always lived, very quiet life
I have never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
[Verse 1]
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
