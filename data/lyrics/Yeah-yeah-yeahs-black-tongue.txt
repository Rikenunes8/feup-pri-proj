You can keep your black tongue
Well, I found it at the mortuary
You know I'm gonna want some, want some
We're high in the back room
Gonna have a pack soon
With this you will regret
Just let it be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sonny kept his ring on
Red tape so ordinary
Love, I feel like it was gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's do this like a prison break
I want to see you scream and shake

Boy you just a stupid bitchÂ 
And girl you just a no good dick
Boy you just a stupid bitch
And girl you just a no good dick
Boy you just a stupid bitch
And girl you just a no good dick
We're gonna keep it in the family
Yeah, well even though were on the run
You know they're gonna want some, want some
We're high in the back room
Gonna have a pack soon
With this you will regret
Just let it be
Yeah, yeah, yeah[Hook]
Boy you just a stupid bitch
