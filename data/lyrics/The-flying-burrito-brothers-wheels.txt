[Verse 1]
We've all got wheels to take ourselves away
We've got the telephones to say what we can't say
We've all got higher and higher every day
Come on wheels, take this boy away
[Bridge]
We're not afraid to ride
We're not afraid to die
So come on wheels, take me home today
Come on wheels, take this boy away
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
And when I feel my time is almost up
And destiny is in my right hand
I'll turn to him who made my faith so strong
Come on wheels, make this boy a man
[Bridge]
We're not afraid to ride
We're not afraid to die
Come on wheels, take me home today
Come on wheels, take this boy away
Come on wheels, take this boy away
