Just looking for a way around

You're the rod, I'm water
I'm just looking for the divine hammer

One divine hammer

I'd bang it all day
Oh, the carpenter goes bang
Bang bang
I'm just looking for one divine hammer
[Hook]
One divine hammer
Divine hammer
[Guitar solo]

I'm just looking for one divine hammer
[Hook]
One divine hammer
One divine hammer
