[Verse 1: 3D]
I seen you go down to a cold mirror
It was never clearer in my era so
You lick a shine upon your forehead or
Check it by the signs in the corridor
You light my ways through the club maze
We would struggle through the dub daze
[Verse 2: 3D]
I see myself in there upon my lover
It's how you go down to the men's room sink
Sad we talk of how madmen think
I see myself in there upon my lover
I don't know her from another miss
I don't know you from another
See me run now you're gone, dream on
[Verse 3: 
Daddy G
]
Why you want to take me to this party and breathe?
I'm dying to leave
Every time we grind we know we severed lines
Where have all those flowers gone?
Long time passing
“Why you keep me testing, keep me tasking?”
You keep on asking
[Verse 4: 3D]
Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like
They're invisible, 
when they trip, it flips
They get physical,
 way below my lips
And everything you got hoi-polloi like
Now you're lost, and you're lethal
And now's about the time you gotta leave all
These good people dream on
[Verse 5: 3D]
Nicer than the bird up in the tree top
Cheaper than the chip inside my laptop
All the variations you could do with me
Nicer than the girl up in your mind, you're free
[Verse 6: 3D & 
Daddy G
]
Automatic crystal remote control
They come to move your soul
You're gonna fade into the background
Like a better smoke'll bring you back round
Like a man slide inside you, my dear
Your cheap beer's filled with crocodile tears
See 'em run, now you're gone, dream on[Outro: 3D]
Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like
I found a reason
I found a reason
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
