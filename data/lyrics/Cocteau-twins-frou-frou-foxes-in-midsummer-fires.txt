I buckled in lust
As got in the wrist
How marriages been
In war all we lose
Close into symbols
A fire-drake's ignitions
They turn infant's breath, my
Milk and wrap to baby
In day
And night to come

I buckled in lust
As got in the wrist
How marriages been
In war all we lose
Close into symbols
A fire-drake's ignitions
They turn infant's breath, my
Milk and wrap to baby
In day
And night to come

Days go
And sutil things
Ad nauseum

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening eyes
On the useless science of cherry-coloured light
(Trouser)
But now this music explain, this is the reason
(Put it)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled round

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening eyes
On the useless science of cherry-coloured light
(Trouser)
But now this music explain, this is the reason
(Put it)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled round

Trouser
Put it
Tighter

They're fanatical
From serpents to dragons
I lost here in flame
You, milk and the passion
Lead weight from these things is over
The youngner was eagerest
I lose in the stairs, I
I miss here to find you

I buckled in lust
As got in the wrist
How marriages been
In war all we lose
Close into symbols
A fire-drake's ignitions
They turn infant's breath, my
Milk and wrap to baby
In day
And night to come
Days go

And sutil things
Ad nauseum

Things old
And young
Very young
Right here comes our reason
New skies are a young escape to find you

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening eyes
(Pulled round)
On the useless science of cherry-coloured light
(Trouser)
But now this music explain, this is the reason
(Put it)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled round

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening eyes
On the useless science of cherry-coloured light
(Trouser)
But now this music explain, this is the reason
(Put it)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
It's to wait for you
(Tighter)
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled round

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening eyes
On the useless science of cherry-coloured light
(Trouser)
But now the music explain, this is the reason
(Put it)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
