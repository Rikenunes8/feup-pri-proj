[Spoken: James Brown]
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thanks for catching the James Brown show
And I hope when you leave you'll be glad you did
'Cause we intend to do a good job, work real hard
So each and everyone will enjoy what they come to see
And I wanna say thanks for all you've done for James Brown and the James Brown show
Because without you there wouldn't be a James Brown (Talk louder)
You want me to talk louder? Hahaha
I thought I gotta sing so loud, I'd be cool when I start talking
Okay, I'll talk louder
I want each and everyone to know, there's something that I'll never forget
And it's nice to know how artists feel about the people who made him
I'll never forget who I am, where I came from, where I am today, and who put me there
You - thank you very much
Thank you
