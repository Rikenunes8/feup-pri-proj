[Verse 1]
Well, I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight
Well, I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight
[Chorus]
I'm gonna hold my baby
As tight as I can
Tonight she'll know
I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight
[Verse 2]
I say, "Well, meet me in a hurry
Behind the barn
Don't you be afraid, darling
I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring along my rocking shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all my blues"
I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight
[Verse 3]
Well, we're gonna rock
We're gonna rock
Let's rock
Come on and rock
We're gonna rock
All our blues away
[Verse 4]
Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rocking tonight
Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rocking tonight
[Chorus]
I'm gonna hold my baby
As tight as I can
Tonight she'll know
I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight[Verse 5]
Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock
Come on and rock, rock, rock
Well, rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away
