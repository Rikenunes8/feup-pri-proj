[Intro: 
Gerry O'Driscoll
]
...and I am not frightened of dying, you know
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime
[Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry]
[Bridge: 
Patricia Watts
]
I never said I was afraid of dying
[Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry]
