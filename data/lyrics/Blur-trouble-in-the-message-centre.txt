[Verse 1]
I am the message centre
Local and direct
Room to room, an operator
(No calls today, dear, they'll just have to wait, dear)
I call and I collect
(So just strike him softly, away from the body)
[Chorus]
You're made up too shiny today
 (In so much trouble)
Your thoughts are just pissing away (In so much trouble)
So much trouble
[Verse 2]
I am a manager
And I am in control
As the local delegator
(No calls today, dear, they'll just have to wait, dear)
I offer no guarantee at all
(So don't take it lightly, you'll put yourself under)
[Chorus]
You're made up too shiny today (In so much trouble)
Your thoughts are just pissing away (In so much trouble)
A new typeface, a new day
 (In so much trouble)
You can't remember ten minutes ago (In so much trouble)
Too much trouble
[Instrumental break]
[Bridge]
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la
(You'll put yourself under)
[Chorus]
You're made up too shiny today (In so much trouble)
Your thoughts are just pissing away (In so much trouble)
A new typeface, a new day (In so much trouble)
You can't remember ten minutes ago (In so much trouble)
Just too much trouble[Bridge]
