[Verse 1]
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Verse 2]
I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
'Cause there are no others
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's all right,  it's all right,  it's all right
It's all wrong,  it's all right
It's all right,  it's all right
