[Verse 1]
Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy
And I became aware this year
If you want to follow me
You've got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs
Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you getting drunk
So sorry, I got you sussed
Hey you smoking mother nature
This is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal
Don't try to gain my trust
Cause you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways
Although you think you must
[Chorus]
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
We're not going to take it
Going to break it
Going to shake it
Let's forget it better still[Bridge]
Now you can't hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
Your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie
To guide you to
Your very own machine
[Chorus]
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take you
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still[Bridge]
We forsake you
Going to rape you
Let's forget you better still
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
[Verse 2]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story
[repeat until fade]
