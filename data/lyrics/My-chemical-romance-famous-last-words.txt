[Intro]
Now, I know that I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's yourâ€”
And I know there's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change
[Verse 1]
So many bright lights to cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak
[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
[Verse 2]
Can you see? My eyes are shining bright
'Cause I'm out here on the other side
O
f a jet black hotel mirror
And I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A love that's so demanding
I get weak
[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home[Guitar Solo]
[Post-Chorus]
These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me, I say
[Bridge]
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
 
(
How can I see, I see you lying
)
'Cause I see you lying next to me (
How can I see, I see you lying
)
With words I thought I'd never speak (
How can I see, I see you lying
)
Awake and unafraid (
How can I see, I see you lying
)
Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone (Or dead)
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
 (Or dead)
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone (Or dead)
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
 (Or dead)
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
 (Or dead)
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
