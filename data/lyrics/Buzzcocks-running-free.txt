[Verse 1]
Here in suburbia, there's nothing left to see
Just want to spend my time running free
I've had enough of the day job, I can see farther than that
Just want to spend my time running free
[Chorus 1]
The air of tension still is rising higher
Screaming emotions are singing to you
(No-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
[Verse 2]
Here in the engine room, a pulse shouts for a word
Just want to spend my time running free
I'll pull out condition, there's no need to face facts
Just want to spend my time running free
[Chorus 2]
You better make a move, before the sleeping gets ya
You better shape soon, before the weak things make ya
(No-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
[Verse 3]
Here in Proles' paradise, experiments on the weak
Just want to spend my time running free
It's a trick of the torment, you tend to forget yourself
Just want to spend my time running free
[Chorus 3]
Your conscience may be changed as the plan gets harder
It's just been rearranged to keep the strata
(No-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
Your conscience may be changed as the plan gets harder
It's just been rearranged to keep the strata
(No-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)[Outro]
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(No-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(No-no-no time, n-no-no-no time)
(N-no-no-no time)
