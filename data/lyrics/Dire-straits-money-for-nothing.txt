[Intro]
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
[Verse 1]
Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Verse 2]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire
[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
Hoover mover
, uh
[Chorus]
Gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
He's gotta move these refrigerators
Got to move these color TVs
Looky here, look out[Verse 3]
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free
[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Verse 4]
Listen here
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV

That's the way you do it
Money for nothin', and your chicks for free
