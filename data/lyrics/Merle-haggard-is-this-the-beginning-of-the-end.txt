[Verse]
I just don't seem to know you anymore
You're only with me every now and then
And you don't kiss me like you did before
Is this the beginning of the end?
[Verse]
Is there a broken heart for me in store?
While I'm holding you, do you pretend
That I'm someone else you're longing for?
Is this the beginning of the end?
[Bridge]
There's a faraway look in your eye
"Am I losing you?" my heart cries
[Verse]
Hold me close and put my heart at ease
Whisper "I love you" once again
Just three words can make my heart believe
This is not the beginning of the end
[Bridge]
There's a faraway look in your eye
"Am I losing you?" my heart cries
[Verse]
Hold me close and put my heart at ease
Whisper "I love you" once again
Just three words can make my heart believe
This is not the beginning of the end
