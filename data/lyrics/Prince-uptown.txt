[Verse 1]
She saw me walking down the streets
Of your fine city
It kind of turned me on when she looked at me
And said, "come here"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers
But she looked so pretty
What can I lose
If I just give a little ear?
What's up little girl?
I ain't got time to play
Baby didn't say too much
She said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by surprise
I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes
And I said, "No, are you?"
Said to myself, said
She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy little mixed up dame
She's just a victim of society
And all its games
[Pre-Chorus]
Now where I come from
We don't let society, tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair, we don't care
It's all about being there
[Chorus]
Everybody's going
Uptown
That's where I want to be
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't want to stop, no
[Verse 2]
As soon as we got there
Good times were rolling
White, black, Puerto Rican
Everybody just a-freaking
Good times were rolling
She started dancing in the streets
Girl, she's just gone mad
You know, she even made love to me
Best that I ever had
I don't usually talk to strangers
This time it's all right
See, she got me hot
I couldn't stop
Good times were rolling all night
All night, yeah[Pre-Chorus]
Now where I come from
We don't give a damn
We do whatever we please
It ain't about no downtown
Nowhere bound
Narrow-minded drag
It's all about being free
[Chorus]
Everybody's going
Uptown
That's where I want to be
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't want to stop, no
[Interlude]
[Outro]
Uptown
Uptown
Everybody's going, everybody's going
Everybody got to,  got to
Uptown
Got to go, got to go-go-go
Got to go Uptown
Uptown
All now
Uptown
Got to go-go-go
Baby, got to go, got to
Uptown
Come on, come on
You, you have to, you got to go
Uptown
Yeah
