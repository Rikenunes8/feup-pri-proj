She's a schemer and she makes me bad
But I love her like those lonely nights
I was in a big room playing my things
Oh I wish she were here she can be so kind
When she's not trying to hide
She tries not to love me but she knows she can
And why don't you come on back from way out west?
And love me, we can work out the rest
And why don't you come on back from way out west?
And love me, we can work out the rest
She thinks she's a mystery to all
But I know what's behind those eyes
Sometimes I think she'll make me forget
What I need most to remember
And then I'll slip on back
Even if they say it's better
And why don't you come on back from way out west?
And love me, we can work out the rest
