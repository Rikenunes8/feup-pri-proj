[Verse 1]
I'm losing ground
Well you know how this world can beat you down
And I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way
[Interlude]
I'm always falling down the same hill, bamboo puncturing this skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place
[Chorus]
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel
[Verse 2]
I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
Don't tell me that you care
There really isn't anything, now, is there?
[Interlude]
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste, like that means something
And oh so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help[Chorus]
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel
[Outro]
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters
