I know I don't want to
Be the one that you run to
When you got nowhere else to go
When you need some love
I know I'm the last one
You try to call but
I always give in
To give you it all

Oh-oh
I can't be your midnight love
Oh-oh-oh
When your silver is my gold
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear I'm blind
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear you're mine

I hope that the right time one day arrives
So I'll be willing to let this die
Able to look you right in the eyes
Say I'm not your consolation prize
Oh-oh
I can't be your midnight love
Oh-oh-oh
When your silver is my gold
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear I'm blind
Oh-oh-oh
In this light, I swear you're mine

I can't be your second best
Close but not your favorite
I keep going back for more
Where there's nothing from before

I can't be your midnight love
Oh-oh-oh
When your silver is my gold
I can't be your second best
Close but not your favorite
I keep going back for more
Where there's nothing from before
