[Verse 1]
You've been so long
Your blind eyes are gone
Your old bones are on their own
So take off your coat
Put a song in your throat
Let the dead beats pound all around
[Chorus]
We will go
Nowhere we know
We don't have to talk at all
Hand me downs
Flypaper towns
Stuck together, one and all
[Verse 2]
The bargains you drive
Buckets and bags
And all your belongings
Your train's in the sand
Ramshackle Land
Let the rats watch the races
[Chorus]
We will go
Nowhere we know
'Til we find our one and all
Hand me downs
Flypaper towns
Stuck together, one and all
[Verse 3]
Praises get spent
Your trick face is bent
Pigsties and prizes
'Cause there's no kind of wealth
You're suiting yourself
You leave yourself behind
[Chorus]
We will go
Nowhere we know
'Til we find our one and all
Hand me downs
Flypaper towns
Stuck together, one and all
