[Verse 1]
Well, the telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is screaming
Won't she leave me alone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone? Ahh
[Verse 2]
Well, every girl that I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Every girl I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Well, I hear my mother calling
But I don't need her as a friend
Well, every girl I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Oh, ohh, mother
Mother
Mother
[Verse 3]
Oh mother dear, please listen
And don't devour me
Oh mother dear, please listen
Don't devour me
Oh women, please have mercy
Let this poor boy be
Oh mother dear, please listen
And don't devour me
Oh mother
[Verse 4]
Well, the telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is screaming
Won't she leave me alone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
Oh, [maniacal laughter], mother, ohhhh
[Outro]
Mother, mother mother
Mother mother, mother, mother, mother...
