A punch to get it, tryin' to get it
To do what I wanted to do
I cried and screamed when I saw my dream
It was dancin' all around the room
Follow, baby, and save my soul
I just couldn't wait for you
Energy, energy, greatest drink
And I knew what I had to do
Baby, baby, that's no lie
Baby, baby, don't ask me why
Take it, break it, break it up
Now glue it back together again
I'm tryin' to drive you, tyin' it off
Then kick it back down the bend
Tryin' to delude me
Trying to give it all you can
Swingin', squealin', brushin' up
Now bring it all home to bed
Baby, baby, that's no lie
Sit on my face when you waste my time
Well, I saw you, talkin' on
Riding on the crest of a wave
How appallin', the music surrounds you
Sounding right in your way
Oh baby, off we go
Headin' for a brand new place
The song's been sung, the deed's been done
Staring you right in the face
Baby, baby, watch your step
You know you really ain't seen nothing yet
