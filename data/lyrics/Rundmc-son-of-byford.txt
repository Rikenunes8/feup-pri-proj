[Intro: D.M.C.]
Ayo, Jay, yo, Jay
, check this out
[Verse: D.M.C.]
I was born son of Byford, brother of Al
Bannah's my mama
 
and Run's my pal
It's McDaniels, not McDonald's
These rhymes are Darryl's, 
those burgers are Ronald's
I ran down my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother and D, huh
[Outro]
Oh, y'all on that tip now, huh?
