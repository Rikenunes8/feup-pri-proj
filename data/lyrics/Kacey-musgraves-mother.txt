[Verse]
Bursting with empathy
I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors
[Chorus]
Wish we didn't live
Wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother
Mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother
Mother
