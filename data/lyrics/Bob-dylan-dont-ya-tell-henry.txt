[Chorus]
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly
[Verse 1]
I went down to the river on a Saturday morn
A-lookin’ around just to see who’s born
I found a little chicken down on his knees
I went up and yelled to him, “Please, please, please!”
[Chorus]
He said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”
[Verse 2]
I went down to the corner at a-half past ten
I’s lookin’ around, I wouldn’t say when
I looked down low, I looked above
And who did I see but the one I love
[Chorus]
She said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”
[Verse 3]
Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve
A-lookin’ around just to see myself
I spotted a horse and a donkey, too
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few
[Chorus]
They said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”
[Verse 4]
Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night
A-lookin’ around, I was outta sight
I looked high and low for that big ol’ tree
I did go upstairs but I didn’t see nobody but me[Chorus]
I said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”
