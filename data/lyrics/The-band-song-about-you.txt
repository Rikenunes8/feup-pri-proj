I've got this worthless collection
Of all my wasted affection for you, for you
Got these memories and confessions
God, I still hate where we left it, I do, I do

Where else can I go with all these emotions?
Call me a psycho, but my way of copin’

Is one more song about you
Two more nights without you
You're still all that's on my mind all the time
It’s 3 AM and now I'm
Four drinks in and I just
Don't know how to let you go, so here it goes
One more song about you
One more song about you

Sick of starin' at the ceilin'
While I spill out what I'm feelin' for you, for you
Sick of pacing in a circle
Wastin' pages in a journal for you, it’s all I do

Whеre else can I go with all thеse emotions?
Call me a psycho, but I’m all alone, writin'

One more song about you
Two more nights without you
You’re still all that's on my mind all the time
It's 3 AM and now I'm
Four drinks in and I just
Don’t know how to let you go, so here it goes

One more song about you
One more song about you
One more song about you
Song about you
One more song about you
Two more nights without you
You're still all that's on my mind all the time
It's 3 AM and now I'm
Four drinks in and I just
Don't know how to let you go, so here it goes

One more song about you
One more song about you
One more song about you
