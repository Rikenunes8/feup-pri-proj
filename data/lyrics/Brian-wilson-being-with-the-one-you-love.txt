Never have I ever
Ever told you of my fears
I thought it was important
To shield you from my doubts and tears
In this world of people fighting right and wrong
Our love will protect and keep us strong
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
Never have you ever
Ever told me you love me (Never ever told me you love me)
Maybe 'cause you're scared love has no lasting guarantee (No lasting guarantee)
But now I'm gonna show you with my open heart
Please tell me now we're never ever gonna be apart
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
Love's not a lonely place (Lonely place)
Locked in your warm embrace (Warm embrace)
Within our private space
In our private space
You have my promise
If you wanna count on me (if you wanna wanna count on me)
Let's have a talk about
A life of possibilities (Talk about the possibilites)
I sing this song to tell you what you mean to me
I see our love stretching to infinity
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
Being with the one you love
