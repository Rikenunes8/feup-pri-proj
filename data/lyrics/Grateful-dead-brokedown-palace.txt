[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone
Goin' to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll
[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul
[Verse 2]
River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama many worlds I've come
Since I first left home
[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the water-side I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul
[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul
