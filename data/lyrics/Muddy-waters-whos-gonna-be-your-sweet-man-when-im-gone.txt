[Chorus]
I wonder who, going to be your sweet man when I'm gone?[x2]
I wonder who you're going to have to love you?
Because I won't ever stay at home
[Verse 1]
Who's that yonder come walking, down the street?
She's the most beautiful girl any man would want to meet
[Chorus]
I wonder who, going to be your sweet man when I'm gone?
I wonder who you're going to have to love you?
Because I won't ever be at home
[Verse 2]
You know I once have would-a married you?
But, you, you married too soon
I don't have no more break, darling
I'll see you after your honeymoon
[Chorus]
