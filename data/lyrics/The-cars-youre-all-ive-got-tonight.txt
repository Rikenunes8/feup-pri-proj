[Verse 1]
I don't care if you hurt me some more
I don't care if you even the score
Well, you can knock me and I don't care
Well, you can mock me, I don't care
You can rock me just 'bout anywhere
It's alright (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
'Cause you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight
[Verse 2]
I don't care if you use me again
I don't care if you abuse me again
Oh, you can make me, I don't care
And you can fake me, I don't care
And you can love me just 'bout anywhere
It's alright (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
'Cause you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I said I need you tonight[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna feel sorry for you-ooh
You don't have to make believe it's you-hoo
You can pump me, I don't care
And you can bump me, I don't care
And you can love me just 'bout anywhere
It's alright (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
When you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I said I need you tonight
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
'Cause you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight
I, I need you tonight
