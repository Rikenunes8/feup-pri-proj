[Verse 1]
Before all of this ever went down
In another place, another town
[Chorus]
You were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd
[Verse 2]
Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life
[Chorus]
And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, thinking out loud
A face in the crowd
[Verse 2]
Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life
[Chorus]
And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd
[Outro]
A face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
