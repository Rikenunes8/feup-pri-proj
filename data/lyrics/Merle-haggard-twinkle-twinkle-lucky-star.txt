[Verse]
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
Can you send me luck from where you are?
Can you make a rainbow shine that far?
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
Can you really make a wish come true?
And do you shine on just a chosen few?
Is it over? Have I gone too far?
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
[Bridge]
Like two ships on the ocean, we drifted apart
And you found an island at sea
I'm still adrift with this pain in my heart
Won't you send her sweet love back to me?
[Verse]
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
Can you send me love from where you are?
Can you make a rainbow shine that far?
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
[Break]
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
[Bridge]
Like two ships on the ocean, we drifted apart
And you found an island at sea
I'm still adrift with this pain in my heart
Won't you send her sweet love back to me?
[Verse]
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
Can you send me love from where you are?
Can you make a rainbow shine that far?
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
