[Verse 1]
The time has come not to be cautious
You must be careful not to make mistakes
For every half-hour in twenty-four
And operations rose faster than they did yesterday
And the lending rate's on your side
So there won't be much of a problem
Then past midnight, there is a rise
When everybody's asleep at home
He becomes nervous and sees a change
Today in futures
[Chorus]
Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
[Verse 2]
Watch the markets move from a screen
In a pocket in a grey flannel suit
Read tomorrow's crash today and check your pulse
Base metals crawled onto the curb
And softs dropped in a summer term
Sugars melted in the mouth of a rude girl
Who knew a better option
She thinks for while
And it could be a long time before he thinks again
And then he looks at the papers and looks again
Today in futures[Chorus]
Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
[Outro]
Today in futures
Futures, futures, futures
Futures, futures, futures
Futures, futures, futures
Futures, futures, futures
