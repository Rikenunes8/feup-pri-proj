Konvict, Music, and you know we Upfront

I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say, "I don't talk Dogg, then she told on me", oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me, and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you
D-O double G and I'm here to put this d— on you
I'm stuck on p— and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot 'fo the end of the night
'Cause p— is p—, and baby, your p— for life
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

Shorty I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of n— and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me, now what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides, I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (Just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
Hmm, it's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your p— is wet, you're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your t— is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Girl, and while you're lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl, girl
