[Verse 1]
I'm afraid, I'm starting to feel
What I said I would not do
The last time really hurt me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last
[Chorus]
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race every time
[Verse 2]
One half wants me to go
Other half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last
[Chorus]
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time
My heart does begin to race every time
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last[Chorus]
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race every time
It's every time
It's every time
'Cause every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
[Outro]
Could it be that this will be the one that lasts?
The fear does start to erase every time
Oh could it be that this will be the one that lasts
For all my times, oh yeah, for all my times
