I need a one-way
A one-way sign
Fagin's prophets on Aesop's ride
Like templar thieves
Well, you've had me
A buck so sweet
You've spoilt the fray
Which of these dauphins can set you free?
From flaming youth to token army
But give me anodyne
Or give me pandrogynes
I'll take home a hidden
A hidden sun
(A hidden sun)
In lieu of morphine (Morphine)
Come eminence
I'm stuck with blunt force (Blunt force), and Morpheus
Oh, Chiron, cleave wherе you've had me
On pain of love I'd shattеred sweet
Which of these dauphins can set you free?
From flaming youth to token army
But give me anodyne
Or give me pandrogynes
I'll take home a hidden sun
(Sun)
But give me anodyne (Dauphine)
Or give me pandrogynes (One day)
I'll take home a hidden sun
I'll take home a hidden sun
