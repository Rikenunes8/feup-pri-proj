[Verse 1]
She knows that I've been doing something wrong
But she won't say anything
She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday
But she won't mind me lying
Mmm, because
[Chorus 1]
Mother stands for comfort
Mother will hide the murderer
[Verse 2]
It breaks the cage and fear escapes and takes possession
Just like a crowd rioting inside
Make me do this, make me do that
Make me do this, make me do that
Am I the cat that takes the bird?
To her the hunted, not the hunter
[Chorus 2]
Mother stands for comfort
Mother will hide the murderer
Mother hides the madman
Mother will stay mum
[Chorus 3]
Mother stands for comfort
Mother will stay mum
She stands for comfort
