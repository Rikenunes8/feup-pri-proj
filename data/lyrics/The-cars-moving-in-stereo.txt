[Verse 1]
Life's the same, I'm moving in stereo
Life's the same except for my shoes
Life's the same, you're shaking like tremolo
Life's the same, it's all inside you
[Verse 2]
It's so easy to blow up your problems
It's so easy to play up your breakdown
It's so easy to fly through a window
It's so easy to fool with the sound
[Verse 3]
It's so tough to get up
It's so tough
It's so tough to live up
It's so tough on you
[Verse 4]
Life's the same, I'm moving in stereo
Life's the same except for my shoes
Life's the same, you're shaking like tremolo
Life's the same, it's all inside you
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Life's the same, I'm moving in stereo
Life's the same except for my shoes
Life's the same, you're shaking like tremolo
Life's the same, it's all inside you
