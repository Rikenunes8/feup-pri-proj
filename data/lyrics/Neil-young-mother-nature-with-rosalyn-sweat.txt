Why do birds fly in the sky?
(I don’t know why)
Why do trees grow so high?
Why does the nightingale
Sing a song so sweet?
Why do the love bird come
Strolling along the street
Why do rivers flow
From mountains high, into the sea?
(I don’t know why)
What makes honey so sweet?
Just how, ask the bees
What makes the world go 'round and 'round
While I sing this song?
It’s mother’s nature way
Doing her nature thing
What makes the world go 'round and 'round
While I sing this song?
It’s mother’s nature way
Doing her nature thing
Why do rivers flow
From mountains high, into the sea?
(I don’t know why)
What makes honey so sweet?
Just how, ask the bees
What makes the world go 'round and 'round
While I sing this song?
It’s mother’s nature way
Doing her nature thing
Why, oh why
Why, why, why
