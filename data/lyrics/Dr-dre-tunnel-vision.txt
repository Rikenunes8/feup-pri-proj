[Intro: Drew & Cash]
"Im gone beat yo ass"
"Nigga I wanna see it happen"
"I'll beat yo ass nigga"
"You still talking shit"
"Aight.."
"How you gone be talking shit, you ain't got no squad with you"
"Fuck you on?"
"What the Fuck you on?"
"talkin' bout squats and shit"
"Who said squats?"
"no I said squad!"
"nigga you said squats"
"Move, shut up shut up"
[Hook: Drew]2x
Straight tunnel vision walkin these streets
Straight tunnel vision me n my peeps
I only talk when spoken to, if i dont fuck wit you
Just me, my bros a few, on the grind for a buck or two
[Verse 1 : Drew]
Straight tunnel vision walkin to class
To much shit going on, I'm just lookin at ass
Most these thotties burning so i just pass
And most these niggas learning nothing but gas
So im fast, to get these jungle trees
, Humble me
I dont brag but ima crumble these, fake MC's
Keep A's up, eyes off the double D's
I should pass, 
O-N-L-Y the weed
But frfr i should focus, or be hopeless
Rather be the first, cus im the coldest
But the brokest, bucks for a bro is what im hoping
I need a token, to play the game, but its broken
Fuck the fame, I'm smoking[Hook: Drew]2x
[Verse 2: Jero]
I got one focus, and that's making it
Ain't worried bout, no other shit
So haters please, release my dick
You clamping too hard, you suffocating it
Tunnel vision is my vision, can't take a L
Cause I'm so used to winning, 
weed, shoes, clothes, fast cars, and naked women
Me and the bros chilling eating Harold's chicken
Went from a recruit to a vet like a C.O.D. mission
In my case is a trophy but you got the ribbon
I'm a superhero, nigga you's a robin
I want people to bump my shit while they heads nodding
Mothafucka me and my clique don't fuck with you
We out here grinding, for a buck or two
Claiming you 100 but you fufu
On this track, me and my nigga Drew
All these hoes, that we running through
"All these hoes that we running through nigga, might even fuck yo bitch!"
[Hook: Drew]2x
[Outro: Drew and Cash]
"Aye pass that"
"You good?"
"Yeah, I'm good"
"His ass tweaking"
"Feel like i'm flying trough a tunnel right now. Aye, what you doing. Pass it back"
"No nigga, no give it back. i'm high as hell"
"Fuck you think,
 Its 
High Life
"
