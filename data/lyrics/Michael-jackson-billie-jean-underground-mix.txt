Who will dance on the floor in the round?
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
Hee-hee, oh-oh, oh-oh

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
[Bridge]
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
Remember to always think twice

Who will dance on the floor in the round?
Hee-hee, oh-oh, oh-oh
