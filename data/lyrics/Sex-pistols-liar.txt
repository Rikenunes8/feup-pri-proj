[Verse 1]
Lie, lie, lie, liar, you lie, lie, lie, lie
Tell me why tell me why
Why'd you have to lie
Should've realised that
Should've told the truth
Should've realised
You know what I'll do
[Chorus]
You're in suspension
You're a liar
[Verse 2]
Now I want to know know know know
I want to know why you never
Look me in the face
Broke a confidence just to please
Your ego should've realised
You know what I know
[Chorus]
You're in suspension
You're a liar
[Verse 3]
I know where you go everybody you know
I know everything that you do or say
So when you tell lies
I'll always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool and I know all
'Cause I know what I know
[Chorus]
You're in suspension
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar[Verse 4]
Lie, lie, lie, lie, liar, you lie, lie, lie, lie
I think you're funny, you're funny, haha
I don't need it don't need your blah, blah
Should've realised I know what you are
[Chorus]
You're in suspension
You're a liar
