Tryin' to remember what my Daddy said
Before too much time took away his head
He said we're going back and I'll show you what I'm talking about
Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse

Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
I tried to tell the people but they never heard a word I say
They say there's nothing out there but wheat fields anyway
Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry in her backyard
Out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard

Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowin' through my head

Late at night, lights dancin' in the northern sky
Like the Indian spirits tryin' to show me how to fly
You can see into the future but it may be a mirage
Like a new car sittin' there in your old garage

Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said

There's a place on the prairie where evil and goodness play
Daddy told me all about it but I don't remember what he said
It might be afternoon and it might be the dead of night
But you'll know when you see it 'cause it sure is a hell of a sight
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Prairie wind blowin' through my head)
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Tryin' to remember what my Daddy said)
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Before too much time took away his head)
Prairie wind blowing through my head
(He said we're gonna go back
And I'll show you what I'm talking about)
Prairie wind blowing through my head

Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse)
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
