Everytime that I see your face
Something moves within my heart
And it thrills me to my soul
And tell me that
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
As I see the morning sun
I know everything is alright
I could see you rushing to my door
And tell me that
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
You told me that
My, my, my, my baby
I can see the morning sun
And knowing that everything, everything is alright
I can see you rushing through the door
And tell me that
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
Love is gonna let me down
