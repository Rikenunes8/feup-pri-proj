Well I remember yesterday, just drifting slowly through a crowded street
With neon darkness shimmering through the haze, a sea of faces rippling in the heat
And from that nameless changing crowd a sweet vibration seemed to fill the air
I stood astounded, staring hard at men with flowers resting in their hair
A sweet confusion filled my mind
Until I woke up only finding everything was just a dream
A dream unusual of its kind
That gave me peace and blew my mind and now I'm hung up on a dream
They spoke with soft persuading words about a living creed of gentle love
And turned me on to sounds unheard and showed me strangest clouded sights above
Which gently touched my aching mind and soothed the wonderings of my troubled brain
Sometimes I think I'll never find such purity and peace of mind again
