[Verse 1]
Who said the sea can't move in winter
Or the clouds stand still in a storm?
Who said a man can't cry and be lonely?
Who says a man can't tend to be bored?
And if you could see inside my heart
You would see loneliness
And if I could show you my mind
You would be depressed
[Chorus]
So I I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
[Verse 2]
So I gather my things and be on my way
Into my lonely place
Said, I'm feelin' lonely and lonesome
And I just need to get away
And if you could know what I'm afraid of
You would be frightened
If you could feel the pain that I'm feelin'
Then you would know why
[Chorus]
So I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
[Breakdown]
So I sit away
Said, I get away
Said, I sit away
Said, I get away
[Bridge]
Oh, why do I feel like I will never be loved again?
There I go back in my mood again
Lonely, lonely, sit away
Help me, just get away
Can you hear me?[Chorus]
Said I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
Sometimes, I just go, and I get away
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
Said, I sit away lonely
