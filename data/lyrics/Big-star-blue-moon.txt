[Verse 1] (2X)
Let me be your one light
And if you'd like a true heart
Take the time to show you're mine
And I'll be a blue moon in the dark
While you sleep you'll see me there
Clouds race across the sky
Close your eyes and don't ask why
And I'll be a blue moon in your eyes
Morning comes and sleeping's done
Birds sing outside
If demons come while you're under
I'll be a blue moon in the sky
