[Verse 1]
I was at a party and this fella said to me
"Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights"
[Verse 2]
I said, "Who are you to talk about impending doom?"
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, "I'm a minister, a big shot in the state"
I said, "I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?"
He said, "Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone"
[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
[Verse 3]
Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
[Verse 4]
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, "Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?"
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, "If you're going somewhere can I come along?"
I said, "Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone"
[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone[Interlude]
[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
