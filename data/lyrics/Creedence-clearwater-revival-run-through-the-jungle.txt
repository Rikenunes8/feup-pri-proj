[Verse 1]
Whoa, thought it was a nightmare
Lord, it all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow
The Devil's on the loose
[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a rumblin'
Callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries, "Take aim"
[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 3]
Over on the mountain
Thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke"
[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
