[Verse 1]
Well, I caught you chasin' my man last night
I'm warnin' you once, I ain't warnin' you twice
You better stay off of my private property
You can do your huntin' outside my fence
And don't trespass, if you got any sense
Or it'll be open season on you
[Chorus 1]
I've got a license and it says he's mine
'Cause I caught him first
Keep your hands to yourself and leave him alone
Or look out for the worst
If you don't ease up on your matin' call
I'll nail your hat to the old barn wall
For it'll be open season on you
[Verse 2]
You go huntin' in your miniskirt
You sit in a bar and you drink and flirt
With everything in pants that comes in view
My man might fall for your little trap
So don't try to crawl up in his lap
Or it'll be open season on you
[Chorus 2]
I've got a license, and it says he's mine
'Cause I caught him first
Keep your hands to yourself and leave him alone
Or look out for the worst
If you don't ease up on your matin' call
I'll nail your hat to the old barn wall
For it'll be open season on you
Yeah, it'll be open season on you
