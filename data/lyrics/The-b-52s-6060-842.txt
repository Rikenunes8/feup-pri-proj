6060-842!
Tina went to the Lady's room
Saw written on the wall
"If you'd like a very nice time
Just give this number a call"
It was 6060-842
And I'm waitin' for you
6060-842
And I'm waitin' for you
Tina reached in her pocketbook
Pulled out a thin dime
Dropped it in the phone slot
Prayin' she'd get the line
It was 6060-842
And I'm waitin' for you
6060-842
And I'm waitin' for you
Dial the number to call
Get no answer at all
Dime's in the slot
Ready to trot
Uh, 6060-842
I've been tryin' all day
And I'm makin' no headway
Operator, what's wrong?
I dial stupid number all day long
Operator said
