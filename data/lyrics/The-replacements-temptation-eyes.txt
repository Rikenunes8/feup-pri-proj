Hit it! Copy!
She's got something that moves my soul
And I know my head is spinning
She got no mistake [?] I know some time
You know she'd ride [?]
Never-ending tonight
With me to be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me
Love me tonight
Her wild-eyed innocence is just a game
Just the same, my head is spinning
She's got no escape [?] you know some time
You know she's right
It's never-ending tonight
With me will be so exciting
Want her all for myselfTemptation eyes
Through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
Come on and love me
Love me tonight
Wow
With me she'll be so excited
I want her all for myself
Temptation eyes
Through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
Come on and love me
Love me

Through my, my, my soul
