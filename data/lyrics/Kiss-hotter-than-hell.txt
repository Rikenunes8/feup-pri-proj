[Intro]
Come on
[Verse 1]
She looked good, she looked hotter than hell
All dressed in satins and lace
I looked at her and it was just too clear
I had to get on the case
[Verse 2]
I said, "Lady, oh lady, can I take you home?
There's just so much we could do
I'll take you all around the whole wide world
Before the evening is through"
[Chorus]
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
You know she's gonna leave you well-done
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
Burn you like the midday sun, ow
[Verse 3]
I asked her why she couldn't make up her mind
She said, "You don't understand
I'd love to go, but there's something you should know"
She showed me her wedding band
[Chorus]
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
You know she's gonna leave you well-done
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
She'll burn you like the midday sun, yeah
[Chorus]
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
You know she's gonna leave you well-done
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
She'll burn you like the midday sun, ow
