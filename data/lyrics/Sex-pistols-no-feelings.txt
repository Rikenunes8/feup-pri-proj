[Verse 1: Johnny Rotten]
I've seen you in the mirror when the story began
And I fell in love with you, I love your mortal sin
Your brains are locked away but I love your company
I only ever leave you when you got no money
I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand I'm in love with myself, myself
My beautiful self
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
And no feelings, and no feelings
And no feelings for anybody else
[Verse 2: Johnny Rotten]
Hello and goodbye in a run around sue
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head you got nothing to say
Get out of the way 'cos I gotta get away
You never realise I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me and I'll beat you black and blue
Okay, I'll send you away
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
I got no feelings, ah no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
Except for myself, my beautiful selfish
[Verse 3: Johnny Rotten]
There ain't no moonlight after midnight
I see you silly people out looking for delight
Well I'm so happy I'm feeling so fine
I'm watching all the rubbish, you're wasting my time
I look around your house and you got nothing to steal
I kick you in the brains when you get down to kneel
And pray, you pray to your god
[Chorus: Johnny Rotten]
No feelings, ah no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
No feelings, ah no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
Except for myself
Your daddy's gone away
Be back another day
See his picture hanging on your wall
