[Verse 1]
I get a warm, warm summer feeling
Walking through the snow
Even chilly darkness has the brightest glow
[Chorus]
And I just love you so, mmm
Sometimes I just don't know, know, know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
[Verse 2]
I say that time just seems
To help this wondrous feeling grow
Maybe I might wake up early one morning
And find it isn't so
[Chorus]
But I just love you so, mmm
Sometimes I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
[Bridge]
You got me feeling just like a rich man
Haven't got a dime
Feeling like a young man
But I'm old as father time
[Outro]
And I just love you so, mmm
Sometimes I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
