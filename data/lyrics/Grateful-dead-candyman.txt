Come on all you
 pretty women
With your hair a-hanging down
Open up your windows 'cause
The Candyman
's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven
, boys
I'll take your money home
[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the 
Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
Till the Candyman comes 'round again
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good mornin', 
Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
Till the Candyman comes 'round again
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Won't you tell everybody you meet that
The Candyman's in town
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
Till the Candyman comes 'round again
