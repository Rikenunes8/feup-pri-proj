[Verse 1]
Old James Dean Monroe
Hands out flowers at the Shop-N-Go
Hopes for money but all he gets is fear
And the wind blows up his coat
And this he scribbles on a perfume note
"If I'm not here, then you're not here"
And he says, "Call me Miscreation
I'm a walking celebration"
[Chorus]
It's hard to make a stand (Yeah)
And it's hard to make a stand (Oh)
Yeah, it's hard to make a stand
[Verse 2]
My friend, oh Lordy
Went to take care of her own body
She got shot down in the road
She looked up before she went
Said, "This isn't really what I meant"
And the Daily News said, "Two with One Stone"
And I say, "Hey there, Miscreation
Bring a flower, time is wasting"
[Chorus]
It's hard to make a stand
And it's hard to make a stand
And it's hard to make a stand
Oh, it's hard to make a stand
Yes it is
[Verse 3]
We got loud guitars and big suspicions
Great big guns and small ambitions
And we still argue over who is God
And I say, "Hey there, Miscreation
Bring a flower, time is wasting"
I say, "Hey there, Miscreation
We all need a celebration"[Chorus]
It's hard to make a stand (Yeah)
And it's hard to make a stand
Oh, it's hard to make a stand (Oh)
Yeah, it's hard to make a stand
Oh, I think it's hard to make a stand (Okay)
