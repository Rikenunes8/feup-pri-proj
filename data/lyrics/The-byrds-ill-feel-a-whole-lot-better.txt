[Verse 1]
The reasons why, oh, I can't say
I have to let you go, babe, and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on
[Chorus]
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
[Verse 2]
Baby, for a long time, you had me believe
That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know, that you were putting me on
[Chorus]
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
[Verse 3]
Now I've got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games anymore
After what you did, I can't stay on
[Chorus]
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
