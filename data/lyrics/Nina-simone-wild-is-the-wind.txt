[Verse 1]
Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
[Verse 2]
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind
[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss, my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
[Verse 4]
Don't you know your life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind
[Verse 3]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss, my life begins
Now that you're spring to me
All things to me
[Verse 4]
Don't you know your life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind[Outro]
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
