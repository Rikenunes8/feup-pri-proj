I'd rather shoot a woman than a man
I worry whether this is my last life
And girl if you're listening
I'm sorry I can't help it
[Chorus]
Oh Dana, oh Dana, come on
I'm forevermore fighting with Steven
We do argue beaucoups
But we know
Overvoted down
And strung out twice
[Chorus]
Oh Dana, oh Dana, come on
We seldom know what things are
Two illusions go very far
[Chorus]
Oh Dana, oh Dana, come on
I got busted across the bridge
They rounded up every soul
But now I'm on the East Side
She says, "Don't give a girl a chance"
She's not afraid to take a chance
[Chorus]
Oh Dana, oh Dana, come on
She's got a magic wand
That says play with yourself
Before other ones
[Chorus]
Oh Dana, oh Dana, come on, come on
Oh, oh Dana, Dana, come on
