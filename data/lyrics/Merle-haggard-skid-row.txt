[Verse]
Well, not long ago, I was a happy man
Money in my pockets with a ring on my hands
My money's all gone and I'm feeling low
Standing on the corner of Skid Row
[Verse]
My girlfriend left me, she don't want me no more
We had a great big fight just a night before
She said I got no class because she knows
I've been hanging around on Skid Row
[Chorus]
Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they snicker at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes
When you're hanging around on Skid Row
[Verse]
I got an old John Beam with a Van Moore crew
Got a great big hole in the bottom of my shoe
My wine's all gone and I need some more
Standing on the corner of Skid Row
[Chorus]
Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they snicker at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes
When you're hanging around on Skid Row
One more time!
