[Verse 1]
All of my love has been taken for granted
I've been fair, but you've been underhanded
I've been disgraced but I can't bear to face it
'Cause the truth is my heart has been abandoned
[Verse 2]
I was hoping for heaven but baby I ain't blind
This ain't the first time I've been undermined
Sad eyes and crooked smile that I remember well
Now it looks like all I got was time to kill
[Chorus]
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
Everything I thought we had
Has all been cast aside
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
[Verse 3]
These boots are the same boots I was wearing then
And this beer I'm drinking is still the same old brand
But these blues are something new
They came around when I lost you
And it looks like I got stuck with an empty hand
[Chorus]
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
You can't fool me , I see it in your eyes
Everything I thought we had
Has all been cast aside
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
