Whoso fly up in the sky
Faster than any boy could ever describe
Who's got that love so deep
And everything alive
(I said)
Jet boys fly
Jet boys gone
Jet boy stole my baby
Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby
This's the kinda place where no one cares
What you're livin' for
And jet boy's so preoccupied
He don't care 'bout before
(That's why)
Jet boys fly
Jet boys gone
Jet boy stole my baby
Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby
My baby
Jet boys fly
Jet boys gone
Jet boy stole my baby
Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby
We was all endangered charms
Swear we're havin' fun
And jet boy knows all we done
That's why he's the one(That's why)
Jet boys fly
Jet boys gone
Jet boy stole my baby
Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby
My pretty baby
My pretty pretty baby
My pretty baby
When I first came around this dump
I knew I couldn't stay
'Cause up above the world are jet boy
That's why I gotta play
(Dontcha know that)
