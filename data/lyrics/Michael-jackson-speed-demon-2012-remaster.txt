I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back
Speedin' on the freeway gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed demon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your ticket right"
And nothin' gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road
Speedin' on the freeway gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed dеmon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your tickеt right"
Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like
For me there's no tomorrow
Go! Go! Go! Go! Aaow!
Speedin' on the freeway gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket, I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon)
I just, pull over boy and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
I just, pull over boy and eat your ticket
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and get your ticket
Eat your ticket
Get your ticket
Eat yo', get yo'
Get your ticket right
