[Verse 1]
I live off you
And you live off me
And the whole world
Lives off of everybody
[Chorus]
See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
[Verse 2]
The cat eats the rat
While the pimp beats the whore
As she just screams out
For more and more
[Chorus]
See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
La la la
[Verse 1]
I live off you
And you live off me
And the whole world
Lives off of everybody
[Chorus]
See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
La la la
