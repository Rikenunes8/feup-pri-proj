[Verse 1]
She was a level-headed dancer
On the road to alcohol
And I was just a soldier
On my way to Montreal
Well she pressed her chest against me
About the time the jukebox broke
Yeah, she give me a peck on the back of the neck
And these are the words she spoke
[Chorus]
Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own
[Verse 2]
Well, I sat there at the table
And I acted real na√Øve
For I knew that 
topless lady
Had something up her sleeve
Well, she danced around the bar room
And she did the hoochy-coo
Yeah she sang her song all night long
Telling me what to do
[Chorus]
Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own
[Verse 3]
Well, I was young and hungry
And about to leave that place
When just as I was leaving
Well she looked me in the face
I said, "You must know the answer"
She said, "No but I'll give it a try"
And to this very day we've been living our way
Here is the reason why[Chorus]
We blew up our TV, threw away our paper
Went to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own
