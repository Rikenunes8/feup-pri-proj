[Verse 1]
Sit down, honey, let's kill some time
Rest your head on this heart of mine
Tell me, honey, cause you look so blue
Just how did they, did they get to you?
An' if it's all a waste of time
Gonna spend it, yours and mine
[Chorus]
Well, someone's in the kitchen
Cooking hearts over the stove
Don't lie to me, never say goodbye to me
I don't want to be here alone
Someone's at the front door
Selling Band-Aids for our sores
You can bleed it, as long as they don't see it
I'm not going to be ignored
[Verse 2]
Come on darling, let's hang around
Let's wreck their precious an' their perfect town
If it's all a dirty shame
I'm gonna do it night and day
[Chorus]
Someone's in the kitchen
Cooking hearts over the stove
Don't lie to me, never say goodbye to me
I don't want to be here alone
Someone's at the front door
Selling Band-Aids for our sores
You can bleed it, as long as they don't see it
I'm not going to be ignored
[Bridge]
Did you ever get the feeling that you don't belong?
Said the teacher in the classroom
I think there's something wrong
But your desks are too heavy and your walls are too white
Your rules are all wrong and it's either run or fight
But I'm still running, I'm still running[Outro]
Sit down, honey, let's kill some time
Rest your head on this heart of mine
Come on darling, let's hang around
Let's wreck their precious an' their perfect town
Cause if it's all a waste of time
Gonna spend it yours and mine
