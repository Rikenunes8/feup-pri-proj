[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
I look at you, then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be
[Chorus: James Hetfield & 
Jason Newsted
]
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Lock horns, I push and I strive
Some how I feel more alive
Bury the need for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be
[Chorus: James Hetfield & 
Jason Newsted
]
Better than you
Better than you
Oh, better than you
Better than you
[Bridge: James Hetfield]
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, nothing brings me down
No, can't stop this train from rolling, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, forever on and on
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: James Hetfield]
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, you, you can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, on and on, and on, and no
No, you can't bring it down 'cause I'm[Chorus: James Hetfield & 
Jason Newsted

Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Ooh, better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Much better than you
Better than you
Better than you
