[Verse 1]
New Jersey turnpike
, ridin' on a wet night
'Neath the refinery's glow
,

But I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I done
[Chorus]

Please don't stop me, please don't stop me
[Verse 2]
Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got's been botherin' me my whole life
[Chorus]
Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me
[Verse 3]
In the wee, wee hours, your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
Radio's jammed up with talk show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk till you lose your patience
[Chorus]
Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me
[Outro]
Hey, somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
Hi ho silver-o
, deliver me from nowhere
