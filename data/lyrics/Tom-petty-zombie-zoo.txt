[Verse 1]
All down the street, they're standing in line
With white lipstick and one thing on their minds
Hey little freak with the lunch pail purse
Underneath the paint, you're just a little girl
[Chorus]
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo
[Verse 2]
Cute little dropout, how come you pack a rod?
Is your mother in a clinic? Has your father got no job?
Sometimes you're so impulsive, you shaved off all your hair
You look like Boris Karloff and you don't even care
[Chorus]
You're dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo
[Verse 3]
She disappears at sunrise
I wonder where she goes until the night
Comes fallin' down again
You show up with your friends, half-alive
[Chorus]
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
[Bridge]
Well, you can make a big impression or go through life unseen
You might wind up restricted and over seventeen
It's so hard to be careful, so easy to be led
Somewhere beyond the pavement, you'll find the living dead[Chorus]
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all she wants to do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo
[Verse 3]
She disappears at sunrise
I wonder where she goes until the night
Comes fallin' down again
You show up with your friends, half-alive
[Chorus]
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all she wants to do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo
Dance down at the Zombie Zoo
Get down at the Zombie Zoo
