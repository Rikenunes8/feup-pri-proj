[Verse 1]
Head away from the years
You're on the price list
Head away from the years
You're on the price list
Head away from the years
You're on the price list
[Chorus 1]
Everything will stop your new changing
The grid will be filled
Go to Scotland, no obligation
We'll send you an invitation
We'll send you an inside shower
We'll send you an inside shower
[Verse 2]
It's on the market
You're on the price list
It's on the market
You're on the price list
It's on the market
You're on the price list
[Chorus 2]
In the spring, who can say?
Please send me evenings and weekends
Shared by with the weeks
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
[Outro]
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
Please send me evenings and weekends
