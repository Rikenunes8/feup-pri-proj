[Verse 1]
I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit
[Chorus]
'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel
[Verse 2]
I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy
[Chorus]
'Cause the child rose as light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
[Verse 3]
I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear[Chorus]
'Cause the child rose as life
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
[Outro]
A lady of woe
A lady of woe
