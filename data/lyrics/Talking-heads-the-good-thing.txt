[Verse 1]
I will fight, will fight with my heart
I will fight, will fight with understanding
In my mind the weather never changes
Skill overcomes unfavorable conditions
[Chorus]
A straight line exists between me and the good thing
I have found the line and its direction is known to me
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing
[Verse 2]
Try to compare what I am presenting
You will meet with much frustration
Try to find similar situation
You will always find the same solution
[Chorus]
As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction
As we economize, efficiency is multiplied
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing
[Bridge]
So I say:
I have adopted this and made it my own
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong
I have adopted this and made it my own
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong
Watch me work
Watch me work
Watch me work, Ha! Ha! Ha!
Watch me work[Outro]
Whoa, work! Work
Work, work
Work, work
Oh, work, work
Oh, work!
