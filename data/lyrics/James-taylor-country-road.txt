[Verse 1]
Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name?
Your way and my way
They seem to be one and the same
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mama don't understand it
She wants to know where I've been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
[Chorus 1]
But you know I could feel it
On a country road
[Verse 2]
Sail on home to Jesus
Won't you, good girls and boys?
I'm all in pieces
You can have your own choice
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I can hear a heavenly band full of angels
And they're comin' to set me free
I don't know nothin' about the why or when
But I can tell you that it's bound to be
[Chorus 2]
Because I could feel it, child, yeah
On a country road
[Chorus 3]
I guess my feet know where they want me to go
Walkin' on a country road, yeah
[Verse 1]
Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name?
Your way and my way
They seem to be one and the same, child[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mama don't understand it
She wants to know where I've been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
[Chorus 4]
But I could feel it, Lord
On a country road
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down
[Chorus 5]
Walk on down a country road
[Outro]
La-la la la-la, la-la la la la-la-laa
La-la-la-la la, la-la la la-la-la-l-la
Country road, woah yeah
Walkin' on a country road
Country road
Woo, country road
