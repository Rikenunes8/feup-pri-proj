[Verse 1]
As I look over this beautiful land, I can't help but realize
That I am alone
Why am I able to waste my energy
To notice life being so beautiful?
Maybe partying will help
[Verse 2]
What of the people who don't have what I ain't got?
Are they victims of my leisure?
To fail is to be a victim
To be a victim of my choice
Maybe partying will help
