[Verse 1]
You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
[Chorus]
Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
[Chorus]
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty-handed armies are going home
Your lover, who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
[Chorus]
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore[Chorus]
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
