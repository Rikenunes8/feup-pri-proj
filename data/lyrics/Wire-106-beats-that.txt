If he had a room, he'd paint it white
Avoids the day, prefers the night
Build slight
Got a head for figures
No time for bickerers
Or so he says
Prefers the company of a woman
One, two, three, four
Finds it more physical, that's an important word
Always seen first then heard
Such a rare bird
With praise he glows, with change he grows
Finds that important, hates waiting
I can't understand why that is so funny
That is sex
