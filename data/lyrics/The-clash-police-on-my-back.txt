[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a-runnin'
Police on my back
I've been hidin'
Police on my back
There was a shootin'
Police on my back
And the victim
Well, he won't come back
[Chorus]
I've been runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done? What have I done?
[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm runnin'
Down the railway track
Won't you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me
If I dare drop back
Won't you give me
All the speed I lack?
[Chorus]
I've been runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done? What have I done?
[Refrain]
I'm runnin'
I'm runnin'
I keep runnin'
[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm runnin'
Down the railway track
Won't you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me
If I dare drop back
Won't you help me
Find the speed I lack?[Chorus]
I've been runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done? What have I done?
[Refrain]
Because I'm runnin'
(Police on my back)
Hidin'
(Police on my back)
Runnin'
(Police on my back)
Hidin'
(Police on my back)
[Outro]
Yes, I'm runnin'
Down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me
If I dare drop back
Won't you give me
All the speed I lack?I've been runnin'
I've been runnin'
