(Spoken Intro)
Alright, here we go... This a little number we call "Give me some sugar, little honey natural bee"
[Verse 1]
Come on now, give me some sugar
Give me some sugar, little honey bee
Don't be afraid, not gonna hurt you
I wouldn't hurt my little honey bee
(That's right)
(Come on)
[Verse 2]
Don't say a word about what we're doin'
Don't say nothin', little honey bee
Don't tell your momma, don't tell your sister
Don't tell your boyfriend, little honey bee
[Chorus 1]
She like to call me king bee, she like to buzz 'round my tree
I call her honey bee
I'm a man in a trance, I'm a boy in short pants
When I see my honey bee
Well I've got something to say
(Buzz awhile!)
[Verse 3]
Look here now, peace in the valley
Peace in the valley with my honey bee
Don't say a word 'bout what we're doin'
Don't say nothin', little honey bee
[Chorus 2]
She give me her monkey hand and a Rambler sedan
I'm the king of Milwaukee
Her juju beads are so nice, she kissed my third cousin twice
I'm the king of Pomona
Well I've got something to say(Come on)
(That's right)
(Everybody)
(Go again)
(Everybody)
(Go again)
(That's right)
