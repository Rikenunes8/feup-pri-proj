[Intro]
Tell us about it
Brand new funk
[Verse 1]
If you want to get down with a bird
This is the way you do it
Walk up and rap to her
Put your hand on the lower level
Come on now, you know
And this is what you rap to her
I mean, come on like you should
Come on with your, come on
[Chorus]
Give me, give me your thing
Give me, give me my thing[x2]
Feels so good, let's get it on
Give
[Verse 2]
Make it stone to the bone
Give me my thing
Give me, give me my thing
Baby, got just what I want
Feel so good
[Chorus]
Give me, give me my thing[x3]
Baby, just give me some more
[Verse 3]
Squeeze me, hold me, roll me
Make me, make me scream
Make me feel, give me my thing
Give me, I need you, baby
Need you now
I don't care, what mama don't like
Give it to me anyhow
Give me, give me my thing
What you got, what I need
What you need, what I got
Make me feel, body hot
Give me, give me my thing
Taking off my shirt
About to work me to death
Give, give me my thing
Gimme, ooh, ooh, ooh[Chorus]
Baby, baby
Give me, give me my thing
Give me, give me, give me, give me
Give me, hey Lord, babe
[Verse 4]
What you need is what I got
Give it up, baby, body hot
I want to be satisfied
Oh, you can get it
Keeping it all inside
[Chorus]
So give me, give me my thing
Give me, I said give me my thing
Oh God, give me my thing
[Bridge]
Help me close, help me close
If you don't help me
I'll do it myself
[Chorus]
Give me, give me your thing
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me[x4]
