[Verse 1]
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad
How brown her eyes
[Chorus]
Now see her walk by, peppermint coat
Button-down clothes, buttoned-up high
Diamonds and stones hang from her hand
Isn't she smart, isn't she grand?
[Verse 2]
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad, how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice, she spoke to me
[Chorus]
Now silver and gold, strawberry clothes
Money will buy something to hold
See in her eyes, nothing will last
Like emerald stones and platinum clasp
[Verse 3]
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad, how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice, she spoke to me
[Chorus]
Now silver and gold, strawberry clothes
Money will buy something to hold
See in her eyes, nothing will last
Like emerald stones and platinum clasp
[Verse 4]
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad, how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice, she spoke to me[Outro]
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad, how brown her eyes
