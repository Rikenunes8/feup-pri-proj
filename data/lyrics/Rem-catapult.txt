[Verse 1]
When we were little boys
When we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole
Open your mouth, a question
[Pre-Chorus]
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
[Chorus]
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
[Verse 2]
When we were little boys
When we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, open your mouth
We in step, in hand
Your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope
A question
[Pre-Chorus]
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
[Chorus]
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult[Bridge]
The porch could be darker
The march could be darker
[Chorus]
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
[Verse 3]
When we were little boys
When we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, open your mouth
We in step, in hand
Your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope
A question
[Pre-Chorus]
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?[Chorus]
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
