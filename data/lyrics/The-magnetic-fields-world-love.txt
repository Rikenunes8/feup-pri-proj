When the rhythm calls, the government falls
Here come the cops
From Tokyo to Soweto
Viva la musica pop
We are black and white and we dance all night
Down at the hop
And the letters were tall on the Berlin Wall
Viva la musica pop
[Chorus]
So if you're feeling low, stuck in some bardo
I, even I know the solution
Love, music, wine and revolution
Love, love, love, music, wine and revolution
[Verse 2]
This too shall pass, so raise your glass
To change and chance
And freedom is the only law
Shall we dance?
This too shall pass, so raise your glass
To change and chance
And freedom is the only law
Shall we dance?
[Chorus]
So if you're feeling low, stuck in some bardo
I, even I know the solution
Love, music, wine and revolution
Love, love, love, music, wine and revolution
So if you're feeling low, stuck in some bardo
I, even I, know the solution
Love, music, wine and revolution
