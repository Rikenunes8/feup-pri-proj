[Verse 1: Damon Albarn & 
Lætitia Sadier
]
All those dirty words 
(
Jusqu' la fin
)
They make us look so dumb 
(
En plein soleil
)
Been drinking far too much 
(
Jusqu' la fin
)
And neither of us mean what we say
 
(
En plein amour
)
[Chorus: Damon Albarn]
Well, you and I collapsed in love
And it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
[Verse 2: Damon Albarn & 
Lætitia Sadier
]
What happened to us? 
(
Jusqu' la fin
)
Soon it will be gone forever (
En plein soleil
)
Infatuated only with ourselves 
(
Jusqu' la fin
)
And neither of us can think straight any more 
(
En plein amour
)
[Chorus: Damon Albarn]
Well, you and I collapsed in love
And it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
When you and I collapsed in love
Well, it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge: Lætitia Sadier]
En plein amour
[Chorus: Damon Albarn]
You and I, we just collapsed in love
And it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
[Outro: Lætitia Sadier]
En plein soleil
