[Chorus]
Cowboys and outlaws
Right guys and southpaws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats
Dirt roads and white lines
And all kinds of stop signs
I stand right here where I'm at
'Cause I wear my own kind of hat
[Verse]
There's two kind of lovers
And two kind of brothers
And two kind of babies to hold
There's two kind of cherries
And two kind of fairies
And two kind of mothers, I'm told and told
[Chorus]
Cowboys and outlaws
Right guys and southpaws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats
Dirt roads and white lines
And all kinds of stop signs
I stand right here where I'm at
'Cause I wear my own kind of hat
[Verse]
There's two kind of lovers
And two kind of brothers
And two kind of babies to hold
There's two kind of cherries
And two kind of fairies
And two kind of mothers, I'm told and told
[Chorus]
Cowboys and outlaws
Right guys and southpaws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats
Dirt roads and white lines
And all kinds of stop signs
I stand right here where I'm at
'Cause I wear my own kind of hat
