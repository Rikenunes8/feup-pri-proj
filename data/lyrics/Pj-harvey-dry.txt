[Verse 1]
I caught it in the face
Coming around again
I thought it was worth waiting
You're caught up in my hair
Wet sides from time to time
But mostly I'm just dry
[Chorus]
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
[Verse 2]
You've come all this way
No hair out of place
You put it on the stage
You put right in my face
[Chorus]
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
[Verse 3]
No water well in sight
No water at my sides
I'm sucking on the well
I'm sucking 'till I'm white
[Chorus]
But you leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
