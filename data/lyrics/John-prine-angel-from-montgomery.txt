[Verse 1]
I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning, and thunder were desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago
[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
[Verse 2]
When I was a young girl, well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken-down dam
[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
[Verse 3]
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say?
[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
