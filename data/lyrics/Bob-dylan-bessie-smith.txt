Bessie was more than just a friend of mine
We shared the good times with the bad
Now many a year has passed me by
I still recall the best thing I ever had
Now I'm goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm wonderin' what she'll do
All the crazy things I had to try
Well I tried them all and then some
But if you're lucky one day you'll find out
Where it is you're really comin' from
Now I'm goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm wonderin' what she'll do
Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing
Now and again I still wonder to myself
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing?
So I'm goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
And when I get there I'm wonderin' what she'll do
