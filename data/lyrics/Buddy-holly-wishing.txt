[Chorus 1]
Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away
[Verse]
Dreaming of the time I can hold you tight
Wishing that the time would come tonight
[Chorus 2]
I've been hoping all along things would turn out right
If I could find a wishing star then I would spend the night
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
