[Verse 1]
Those who know
They don't let it show
They just give you one long glance and you go
[Verse 2]
Goes to show
How winds blow
The weather's fine and I feel so so-so
[Verse 3]
Birds of prey
With too much to say
Oh what could be my destiny, another rainy day?
[Chorus]
Why ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more needles in the camel's eye
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Those who know
They don't let it show
They just give you one long glance and you go
[Chorus]
Why ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more 
needles
 in the camel's eye
[Outro]
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Da-da-ra-da, bye
Da-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, ta, ta-ra-ra-ra, ta, ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, ra-ra-ra
Ta-ra-ra, ta-ra-ra
Ta-ta-ta-ra-ra, ta-ra-ra
Ta-ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra-ra-ra, ta-ta-ra-ra-ra, ra-ra-ra
Ta-na-na-na, ra-ra-ra
Ta-na-na-na
All mysteries are just more 
needles
 in the camel's eye
