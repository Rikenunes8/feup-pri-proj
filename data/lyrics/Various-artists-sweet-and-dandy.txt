Alright!

Eh hey! Etty inna room a-cry
Mama say she must wipe her eye
Papa say, "she nuh fi foolish like she never been to school at all"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing in that ballroom last night
Eh hey! Johnson inna room a-fret
Uncle say him must hold up him head
Aunty say, "he nuh fi foolish like it's not time for his wedding day"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing in that ballroom last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
20 bottle of kola wine
All the people them dress up inna white
Fi go eat up Johnson wedding cake

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing in that ball room last night

Hey, but it was sweet and dandy, sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy, sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy, sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy, oh (sweet and dandy)
