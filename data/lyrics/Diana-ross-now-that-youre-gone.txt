My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
I'm living my life all alone
Or hit by a blow
To my pride
But I'm doing OK
I won't let you see
What this has done to me
I guess I'll just take it in stride
Come what may
My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
How can one do what should be done by two
I guess that's a crazy question to ask
I might seem happy
But don't be fooled by my appearance
Make no mistake
I'm just wearing a mask
My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow longNow that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're goneMy nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
