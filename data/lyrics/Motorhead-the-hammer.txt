Let the killers go
Don't let your mother know
Don't go out tonight
Don't even try to fight
Cause I can see
I've got the thing you need
And I'm here to stay
It's gonna be that way
Don't try to run, don't try to scream
Believe me
The hammer's gonna smash your dream
I'm in your life, just might be in your wife
Could be behind your back
I might be on your track
And it might be true, I might be hunting you
I'll scare you half to death
I'll take away your breath
Don't try to see, don't you try to hide
Believe me
The hammer's gonna make you die
Ain't that right?
There ain't no way you'll see another day
I'm shooting out your lights
Bring you eternal night
And your eternal tricks begin to make me sick
The only thing I know is that you've gotta go
Don't you panic, babe, don't look around
Believe me
The hammer's gonna bring you down
Believe me
The hammer's coming down
