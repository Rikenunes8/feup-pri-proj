[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh
Bad
[Verse 1]
Yeah
Come clean, confess up
Tell all, spill gut
Off the veil, stand revealed
Show the cards
Bring it on
Break the seal
[Interlude]
(Ladies and Gentleman, step right up and
See the man who told the truth)
[Chorus]
Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking
On a bad seed
On a bad seed
Ahh choking
[Verse 2]
Let on, load off
Confess, cast off
At the mercy, the cat is out
Drop the disguise
Spit it up
Spit it out
[Interlude]
(And now, what you've all been waiting for
I give you He Who Suffers The Truth)
[Chorus]
Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking
On a bad seed
Choking on a bad seed[Post-Chorus]
Off the veil
Stand revealed
Bring it on
Break the Seal
At the mercy
Cat is out
Spit it up
Spit it out
Spit it up
Spit it out
Spit it out now!
[Guitar Solo]
At the mercy

[Chorus]
Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
Yeah, you bit more than you need
Now you're choking on a
Choking, choking, choking on a bad seed[Post-Chorus]
Off the veil
Stand revealed
Bring it on
Break the Seal
At the mercy
Cat is out
Spit it up
Spit it out
Spit it up
Spit it out
Spit it out now, yeah, yeah!

Choking on a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad seed
