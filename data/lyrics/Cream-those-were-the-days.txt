When the city of Atlantis
Stood serene above the sea
Long time before our time
When the world was free
Those were the days
Golden cymbals flying
On ocarina sounds
Before wild Medusa's serpents
Gave birth to hell
Disguised as heaven
Those were the days (Yes, they were)
Those were the days
Those were their ways
Miracles everywhere-where are they now?
They're gone
Bold were their ways (Yes, they were)
Bold were their ways
Those were the days (Yes, they were)
Those were the days
Tie your painted shoes and dance
Blue daylight in your hair
Overhead a noiseless eagle
Fans a flame
Wonder everywhere
Those were the days (Yes, they were)
Those were the days
Those were their ways
Miracles everywhere-where are they now?
They're gone
Bold were their ways (Yes, they were)
Bold were their ways
Those were the days (Yes, they were)
Those were the days
