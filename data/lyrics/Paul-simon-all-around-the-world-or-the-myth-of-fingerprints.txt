[Verse 1]
Over the mountain, down in the valley
Lives a former talk-show host
Everybody knows his name
He said, "
There's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
I've seen them all and man, they're all the same
"
[Chorus 1]
Well, the sun gets weary
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the 
black pit town
Somebody says, "What's a better thing to do?"
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world
[Verse 2]
Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere
There's a former army post
Abandoned now just like the war
And there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's what that old army post was for
[Chorus 2]
Well, the sun gets bloody
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the black pit town
Somebody says, "What's a better thing to do?"
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world
[Verse 3]
Over the mountain, down in the valley
Lives the former talk-show host
Far and wide his name was known
He said, "There's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's why we must learn to live alone"[Outro]
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
