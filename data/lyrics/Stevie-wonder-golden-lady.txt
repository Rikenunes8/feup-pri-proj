[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise
[Pre-Chorus]
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
'Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it
[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away
[Verse 2]
Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand
[Pre-Chorus]
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that here's a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away
[Organ Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true
There is no way that I'll be losing
[Chorus]
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
