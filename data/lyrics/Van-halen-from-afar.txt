[Verse 1]
If I cannot see you from afar
Look into your eyes, that hint of depth hidden inside
If I cannot hear you from afar
Whisper in my ear, rest assured that you are near
[Chorus 1]
And I know not what it's like, the aforementioned
For the distance between us
As are the stars, I only have you
In my imagination, in my imagination
Just to love you from afar
[Verse 2]
If I cannot kiss you from afar
Press against your lips, taste the sweetness of your breath
If I cannot touch you from afar
Hold you in my arms, keep you warm and safe from harm
[Chorus 2]
Though our circumstances cause separation
In the absence, there's a presence in my heart
I will surrender, I'll surrender to my
Quiet contemplation, my quiet contemplation
I'll just, I'll just love you from afar[Bridge]
There must be a better way
A better way of passing the time
I can't seem to get her out, out of my
Get her out of my mind
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 1]
And I know not what it's like, the aforementioned
For the distance between us
As are the stars, I only have you
In my imagination, in my imagination
In my imagination, in my imagination
Just to love you
[Outro]
Just to love you
Just to love you
