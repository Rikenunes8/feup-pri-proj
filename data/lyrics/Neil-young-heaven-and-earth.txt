Between heaven and earth
There's a ballroom floor
Where the couples glide
In the evermore

Floating through the clouds
Dancing in the rain
Eyes that see no lies
Hearts that feel no pain

Hope it's not too late
We were more than friends
I can hardly wait
Till we meet again

If you don't really know
Where you want to go
It makes no difference
Which road you take

Hope it's not too late
We were more than friends
I can hardly wait
Till we meet again
We never danced
We never danced
We never danced
The night away
We never danced
We never danced
We never danced
The night away
