[Verse 1]
Freak out and give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know
Who is righteous, what is bold
So Iâ€™m told
[Pre-Chorus]
Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?
[Verse 2]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hipsters unite
Come align for the big fight to rock (For you)
But beware
All those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down
They are frightened and they're scared
If you don't stare
[Pre-Chorus]
Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?[Chorus]
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
I know, I know, I know
Should have listened when I was told
[Pre-Chorus]
Who wants that honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?
[Chorus]
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
