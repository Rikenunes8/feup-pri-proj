[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand, and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
[Verse 2: Neil Tennant & 
Helena Springs
]
Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls
[Interlude: Helena Springs]
(How much do you need?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh, West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End Girls
West End girls[Verse 3: Neil Tennant & 
Helena Springs
]
You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant & 
Helena Springs
]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world
East End Boys, West End girls
West End girls
West End girls
[Outro: Neil Tennant & 
Helena Springs
]
West End girls
(How far have you been?)
Girls
East End boys
And West End girls
And West End girls
(...forever)
And West End girls
(How far have you been?)
East End boys
The West End girls
The West End boys
And West End girls
The West End girls
The West End boys
The West End girls
