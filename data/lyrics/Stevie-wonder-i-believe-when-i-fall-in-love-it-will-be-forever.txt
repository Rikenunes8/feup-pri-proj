[Verse 1]
Shattered dreams
Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
[Chorus 1]
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
[Verse 2]
Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind
Mm
[Chorus 3]
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Ever, ever, ever, ever
Ow!
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
