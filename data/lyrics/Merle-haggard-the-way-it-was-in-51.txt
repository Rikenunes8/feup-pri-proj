[Verse]
Sixty-Six was still a narrow two-lane highway
Harry Truman was the man who ran the show
The bad Korean war was just beginning
And I was just three years too young to go
Country music hadn't gone to New York City yet
And a service man was proud of what he'd done
And Hank and Lefty crowded every jukebox
That's the way it was in '51
[Chorus] [x2]
There's so much about the good old days I'd love to tell
And there's folks around I know, still remember well
Slow dancing close together when a ballad played
'Cause a thing called, 'Rock and Roll' was yet to come
It was a big year for a drive-in restaurant, Carhop
And that's the way it was in '51
[Outro]
Hank and Lefty crowded every jukebox
Oh Lord, that's the way it was in '51
