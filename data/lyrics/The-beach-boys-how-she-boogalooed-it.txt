[Verse 1]
Oh, we were strangers in a really big city
Got excited by the sound of a party
Now my heart beat while the music was grooving
And if you wanted to, you couldn't keep from moving
Look around, do you believe what you seeing
The walls are moving, the ceiling's a-reeling
[Verse 2]
Couples over in the corner romancing
Oh, the boys are witness some outta sight dancing
Gotta girl giving me some lessons
And now she's gonna be my obsession
Aren't you glad we found our way in here
Put another record up on the player
[Verse 3]
Hey, there's a stoned party dancing with the police
Don't have to worry about disturbing the peace
Met a fine chick that really got to me
Good Lord, how she boogalooed to me
Oh my, how she boogalooed it to me
Come on, sock it, sock it to me
S-O-C-K-I-T to me
