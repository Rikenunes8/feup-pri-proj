Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

When you left, the door was
Slamming
You paused in the doorway
Slamming
As though a thought stole you away
Slamming
I watched the world pull you away
Slamming
So I run into the hall
Lock it
Into the corridor
Lock it
There's a door in the house
Slamming
I hear the lift descending
Slamming
I hear it hit the landing
Slamming
See the hackles on the cat
Standing

With my key I
Lock it
With my key I
Lock it up
With my key I
Lock it
With my key I
Lock it up

I am the concierge chez-moi, honey
Won't letcha in for love, nor money
"Let me in!"
My home, my joy
I'm barred and bolted and I
Won't let you in
Get out of my house!
No stranger's feet
Will enter me
Get out of my house!
I wash the panes
Get out of my house!
I clean the stains away
Get out of my house!

This house is as old as I am
Slamming
This house knows all I have done
Slamming
They come with their weather hanging 'round them
Slamming
But can't knock my door down!
Slamming

With my key I
Lock it
With my key I
Lock it
This house is full of m-m-my mess
Slamming
This house is full of m-m-mistakes
Slamming
This house is full of m-m-madness
Slamming
This house is full of, full of, full of fight
Slam it

With my keeper I
Clean up
With my keeper I
Clean it all up
With my keeper I
Clean up
With my keeper I
Clean it all up

I am the concierge chez-moi, honey
Won't letcha in for love, nor money
"It's cold out here!"
My home, my joy
I'm barred and bolted and I
Get out of my...
Won't let you in

Get out of my house!
No stranger's feet
Get out of my house!
Will enter me
Get out of my house!
I wash the panes
Get out of my house!
I clean the stains
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Won't enter me
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Yeah! Won't let you in!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

Let me in!
Woman, let me in!
Let me bring in the memories!
Woman, let me in!
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams!
I will not let you in!
Don't you bring back the reveries
I turn into a bird
Carry further than the word is heard
Woman, let me in!
I turn into the wind
I blow you a cold kiss
Stronger than the song's hit
I will not let you in
I face towards the wind
I change into the Mule
I change into the Mule
Let me in

Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw-hee-haw-hee-haw-hee-haw...
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
