[Verse 1]
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
I know where you been and I know what you been doing
Don't lie to me
[Verse 2]
Don't push me 'round, don't push me 'round
Don't push me 'round, don't push me 'round
I don't like that and now I'm telling you
Don't push me 'round
[Verse 3]
Don't cross me, babe, don't cross me, babe
Don't cross me, babe, don't cross me, babe
You said you wouldn't but I'm just making sure
Don't cross me, babe
