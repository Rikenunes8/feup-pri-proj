You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change the world
[Pre-Chorus]
But when you talk about destruction

Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
(Oh, shooby-doo-wah, oh, shooby-doo-wah)[Pre-Chorus]

All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
(Shooby-doo-wah, oh, shooby-doo-wah)

You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
