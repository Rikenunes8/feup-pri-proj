[Verse 1]
All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery
[Chorus]
But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
[Verse 2]
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play
[Chorus]
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
[Outro]
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
