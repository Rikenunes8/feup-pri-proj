[Intro: Redman]
Yo, yo, yo (Yeah, yeah)
Yo, yo
[Verse 1: Redman]
My flow's remarkable
Doc walk like Caine from Kung Fu 'round the globe
Throw obstacles, I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's
Drum racks to the rims, to the caps
Yo Methical, and D, I'm ASAP (Come on now)
I'm crack of dawn chicken huntin' at KFC (Woo)
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talked about
Now I rock the house, chalk 'em out
[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yeah, no doubt
Who got the biggest ass in the house? (Yeah)
Young miss, fillet-of-fish, saltwater trout
Pretty young thing, got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whisperin' them sweet nothings, I air it out (Air it out)
Baby, you got me like Joanie had Chachi
Until she got high and went and fucked Potsie
 (Yeah)
Lady Godiva, from day one a dick rider
Liar, liar, set your pussy on fire
[Verse 3: D'Angelo]
I see you dancin' right now
I don't need to tell you that you know how
Baby, you do, oh
I say you belong
And if you dream to be free
I can take you there, just follow me
Baby, I won't, huh
I won't steer you wrong
[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
And it seems like to me
You want someone to fit your pedigree
Baby, I do, huh
So what you want?
Smack your ass, pull your hair
And I even kiss you way down there
You know that I will, huh
Think I won't? Huh[Chorus: D'Angelo, 
Method Man
]
Specially when you do it
Left and right, keep it movin'
Up and down, how we do it, babe

Up and down, so what you doin'?

Method Man
]
Here you are in my world (It's just my world)
Make you feel like a pearl
I'll rub your back, huh, and fulfill your needs
So why don't we just get undressed?
Feel the tender touch of your caress
That's what I want
Why don't you give it to me? (
Yeah, give it to me
)[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
I will have you believe
There's no reason for you to leave
Stay right here (Stay right here) in my arms (In my arms, oh)
Where you're safe and secure (Yeah)
Here with me you can be sure
There's no threat (Yeah), say you turn me on
[Chorus: D'Angelo, 
Method Man

Specially when you do it
Left and right, oh, yeah
Up and down, you keep it movin'

Up and down, oh, yeah

Up and down, don't stop doin' it, babe
Left and right, just keep doin' it, baby
