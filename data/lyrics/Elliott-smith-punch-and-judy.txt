[Verse 1]
A wallflower Punch talks to Judy
In a crowded corner where anybody can listen in
But they don't read page to page or speak easy
Now, they're gonna go say the words in the wrong order again
[Verse 2]
They walk in a circle through all the sidewalk scenes
They used to be a part of one time
Now, everybody just stares and whispers
Driving around up and down Division Street
I used to like it here
It just bums me out to remember
[Chorus]
Can't you ever treat anyone nice?
Think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
[Verse 3]
They draw the curtain
Wait for a call
Pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all
[Chorus]
Can't you ever treat anyone nice?
Think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
Gonna make the same mistake twice
