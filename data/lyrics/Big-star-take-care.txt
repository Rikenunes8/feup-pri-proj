[Verse 1]
Take care not to hurt yourself
Beware of the need for help
You might need too much
And people are such
[Chorus]
Take care, please, take care
[Verse 2]
Some people read idea books
And some people have pretty looks
But if your eyes are wide
And all words aside
[Chorus]
Take care, please, take care
[Verse 3]
This sounds a bit like goodbye
In a way it is I guess
As I leave your side
I've taken the air
[Chorus]
Take care, please, take care
Take care, please, take care
