Too long
Too long
Too long
Too long
[Verse 1]
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's getting strong
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's in my bones
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's getting strong
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's in my bones
[Chorus]
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
[Verse 2]
At last the long wait is over, the weight is off my shoulders
I'm taking all control, yeah
My, my mind is set so free, I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me
[Chorus]
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
[Verse 3]
I see, you feel the way I do, the feelingâ€™s oh so true
The good feelings coming through
My, my mind is set so free, I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me
[Chorus]
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?[Verse 1]
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
The feeling's getting strong
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
The feeling's in my bones
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
The feeling's getting strong
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
The feeling's in my bones
[Chorus]
