Time
Needs another minute
(At least)
Take your time
But you've got a limit, yeah
That girl looks forward to another meetin'
Just like everyday people I know
Look forward to another simple greetin'
A bear, a bear in the woods looks forward to hibernatin'
Just any ol' player you know
All he needs is a ratin'
TIME is education
Even when they tell you it's sophistication
Oh, you know, you know that time
Needs to be a little longer
Oh TIME!
The universe needs to be a little stronger
Time they say is the answer, huh
But I don't believe it
TIME
