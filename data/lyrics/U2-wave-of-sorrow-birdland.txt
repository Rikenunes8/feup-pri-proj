Heat haze rising on Hell's own hill
To wake up this morning is an act of will
You walked through the night to get here today
To bring your children, to give them a way
Oh oh, this cruel sun
Its daylight never done
Cruelty just begun
To make a shadow of everyone
And if the rain came
And if the rain came now
Souls bent over without a breeze
Blankets on burning trees
I'm sick without disease
Nobility on its knees
And if the rain came
And if the rain came
Now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow?
A wave of sorrow
Where now the holy cities?
Where all the ancient holy scrolls?
Where now the Emperor Menelik
And Queen of Sheba's gold?
You my bride wear her crown
On your finger, precious stone
Has every good thing now been sold?
Son of shepherd boy now king
What wisdom can you bring?
What lyric could you sing?
Where is the music of the seraphim?And if the rain came
And if the rain came now
Would it wash us all away
On a wave of sorrow?
A wave, upon a wave of sorrow
Wave
Blessed are the meek who scratch in the dirt
For they shall inherit what's left of the Earth
Blessed are the kings who have left their thrones
They are blessed in this valley of dry bones
Blessed are you with an empty heart
For you have nothing from which you cannot part
Blessed is the ego if it's all we've got this hour
Blessed is the voice that speaks truth to power
Blessed is the sex worker's body sold tonight
She works with what she's got to save her children's life
Blessed are the deaf who cannot hear her scream
Blessed are the stupid who can't dream
Blessed are the tin can cardboard slums
And blessed is the spirit that overcomes
