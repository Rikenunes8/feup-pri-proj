Edumare nikan lo rokan to wa rinu

When he woke her up this morning she saw something on his mind
His eyes were cold and distant and his spirit was unkind
He said I'm off to find myself and I won't be coming back
She said ask the Lord to help you not to act like that
Why don't you just ask the Lord to help you not to act like that?

Now I know a woman burdened by the choices that she's made
Life reflects the consequence of making mistakes
So in her prayers each night she prays perpetually
Lord help me now to be the best that I can be
Father won't you just help me now to be the best that I can be?

Cause I know there is joy, there is forgiving
There is peace and contentment
There is love and it grows unrelenting
I know my Lord He loves me just like that
I don't have to worry cause I know He loves me just like that

Well you may know some women hurting like the ones I've just described

Who's future seem impossible for them to survive
You can tell them I'm living proof by what He's done for me
The only thing required is that you just believe
All you have to do is simply just believe

Just like that, just like that
Think about it He can make everything change
Just like that
He's giving me love unconditionally
Treating my soul with everything I need
I love the way He loves me just like that

Now have faith in what you hope for and not in what you see
Believe in what I say to you and keep your eyes on Me
Cause I can change your husband's heart and make his love for you come back
Don't doubt what I can do, I love you just like that
won finu seka won fode sotito
