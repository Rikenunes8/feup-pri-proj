Hey, yo, what's the 411, hun?

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Well, I be Puba on this here, the nigga from last year
Girbauds hangin' baggy
, 
Tommy Hilfiger top gear
Take no shorts, I'm doin' lovely in all sports
Even swing the pole at the hole on my golf course
Some say I'm fair, see, 'cause I'm horny and nasty
If I see some rugged joints, then I won't let it pass me
I take no shorts, let suckers step up to see
I'll flip the script, and get harder than Jeopardy
I shot the sheriff and the mutherfuckin' deputy, test me, check it
I'm not Keith Sweat, but bet that ass that I can make it last
Skinz turn their head so fast, they end up catchin' whiplash
If hun's a monster, 
I'm Carl Lewis on the meter dash
It's Grand Puba, baby, and I'm gettin' crazy cash
What's the 411? Let me know, hun
What's the 411?[Hook]
What's the 411, hun?
What's the 411, hun?
I got it goin' on
Ay, yo, I got it goin' on, hun
Ay, yo, what's the 411, hun?
What's the 411, hun?
I said I got it goin' on
Ay, yo, I got it goin' on
[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, nigga, what makes ya different from the next nigga?
Seen ya last week, and ya couldn't even speak
Ya try ta play like Mr. All Of That
But now ya wanna come to me with some chitchat?
I don't have no time for no 'Wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am'
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit the skins and scram
The same ol' shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not havin' that, no, I'm not havin' that
Ya gotta do a lot more, and that's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't runnin' up in me
I need a man whose lookin' out with some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we will see
So if you wit' it, then drop the seven digits
And I might just give you a call
If you ain't wit' it, then don't waste your time at all
So what's the 411, hun?[Bridge: Grand Puba & 
Pop
]
Hey, yo, honey was talkin' a little somethin', man
Yo, so what's up? Push up, man
I'm gonna catch up with it in a minute
Right now, see what she talkin' about
So set it straight, man
Aight, yo, I'll get back wit' ya lata, G
Chill
[Hook: Grand Puba & 
Mary J. Blige
]
All my love is all I have
And Grand Puba's very special
All my life I look for you
And today your dream comes true
You need me and I need you
Grand Puba is very special
Things just seem to do divine
This is how the two combine
I know our love was meant to be
Mary Blige is somethin' kinda special
Love is life and life is livin'! You're very special
You know it, baby, you got it goin' on a little somethin'
So baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
A little time, spend a little time
[Outro: Grand Puba & 
Pop
]
Ay, yo, yo Pop, Pop
Yeah man?
Check it, man, a little resume with that skit, man
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
About that 411, man?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna see what the prognosis is, though
Yeah, yeah, that Willie Bobo, man, we flowin' it off
Bounce on her for another day, man
Yeah, take the skyline, man
