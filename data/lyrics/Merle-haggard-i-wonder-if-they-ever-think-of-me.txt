[Verse 1]
There's not much a man can do inside a prisoner
Just take his memory trips and fights the pain
And a word from home can mean so much to a prisoner
It's been years since that last letter came
[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of mama
And my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet Marie
And old friends I ran around with keep on running through my mind
But I just wonder if they ever think of me
[Verse 2]
I wonder if they know that I'm still living
And still proud to be a part of Uncle Sam
I wonder if they think I died of hunger
In this rotten prison camp in Viet Nam
[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of mama
And my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet Marie
And I remember daddy saying you'll come back a better man
And I just wonder if they ever think of me
[Outro]
Oh, I just wonder if they ever think of me
