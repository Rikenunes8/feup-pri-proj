"I'm entertain' the people and I'm also assert callins is calling for peace in the carnival and love
And also, all the youth, the young generation of today, I am begging them, and I'm preaching to them and I'm selling my record, I am selling clothes, I'm selling cloth to help the young generation of England today
Black, white, pink, blue, you name it
And all you millions out there, come down at the night time, the carnival time
Stop freezing, everybody, 'cause we are having a great time here"
Summon up the mas! (Like this)
Play on the pan!
Starin' dreads are jerking their locks
The White Star liner sank in the docks
But on the drummers face, there is a look of dread
He drums away 400 years of dread
The dancer man, with the the power of mas
Smoking to the mighty sparrow's blast
But you better be careful
You still got to watch, watch yourself
You wanna be crazy
So you wanna go crazy
Let's go crazy
So you wanna be crazy
Then let's go crazy
Let's go crazy
The lawful force are here, of course
For special offenders, for the special court
But the young men know when the sun has set
Darkness comes to settle the debt
Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest
They're waiting for the sun to set
They're waiting for the sun to set
So you wanna go crazy
So you wanna be crazy
Let's go crazy
So you wanna go crazy
Then let's go crazy
Let's go crazy
The mighty observer keeps his cabinets hot
A great meeting of a'rhythm and a'rhythm and face
Humming of valves and a children's place
The sticks man gives the copper good excuse
To shut off the ganja and control the juice
Control the juice
For sure
Control the juiceSo take it on crazy
So take it out crazy
Let's go crazy
Just take it on crazy
Jah, Chaka
Take it on crazy
Let's go crazy
Bricks and bottles
Corrugated iron (Crazy)
Shields and helmets
Carnival time (Crazy)
Take it on crazy
'N moa ambassa
Take it on crazy
Sledgehammer sound
Take it on crazy
Ray symbolic
Take it on crazy
From jam-down town
"And as times go, have you each and everyone of us who gathered here, are we are little ants behold on this Earth today to make peace and love with the new arrive and also to help the young generation of tomorrow
Yes, sunbeam, that means, we don't want no war at this carnival this day
