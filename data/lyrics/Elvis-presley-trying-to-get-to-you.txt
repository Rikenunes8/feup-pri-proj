[Verse 1]
I've been travelling over mountains
Even through the valleys too
I've been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you
[Verse 2]
Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you
[Bridge 1]
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing
[Verse 3]
I just had to reach you, baby
In spite of all that I've been through
I kept travelling night and day
I kept running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you
[Interlude]
[Verse 4]
Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
Baby, trying to get to you
[Bridge 2]
Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true[Verse 5]
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through
When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light
When I was trying to get to you
