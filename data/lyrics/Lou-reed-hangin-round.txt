[Verse 1]
Harry was a rich young man who would become a priest
He dug up his dear father who was recently deceased
He did it with tarot cards and a mystically attuned mind
And shortly therein after he did find
Jeanie was a spoiled young brat, she thought she knew it all
She smoked mentholated cigarettes
 and she had sex in the hall
But she was not my kind or even of my sign
The kind of animal that I would be about
[Chorus]
Woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago, oh woh woh
You keep hangin' 'round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
All right now
Ah-huh-huh
[Verse 2]
Kathy was a bit surreal, she painted all her toes
And on her face she wore dentures clamped tightly to her nose
And when she finally spoke her twang her glasses broke
And no one else could smoke while she was in the room
Hark the herald angels sang
 and reached out for a phone
And plucking it with a knife in hand dialed long distance home
But it was all too much sprinkling angel dust
To AT&T who didn't wish you well
[Chorus]
Oh, but you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago, ho ho ho ho
You keep hangin' 'round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago[Outro]
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round, that's all you're doing baby
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round, ooohhh
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round
