If you want some loving, yea, that I'll give to you
And if you want some hugging, baby, I can hug some, too
All I want, baby, is some thoughts of you
Just a little bit of attention you know will see me through
'Cause you know you are my kind
And I want you to be mine
I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
Yes I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
I would like to make love to you when the lights are low
I would like to scream to you, baby, just to let you know
All I want, baby, is some thoughts of you
Just a little bit attention you know will see me through
'Cause you know you are my kind
And I want you to be mine
I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
Yes I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
Oh what a thrill, yeah, I would get
If I could comfort you, baby, and make you my pet
All I want, baby, is some thoughts of you
Just a little bit attention you know will see me through
'Cause you know you are my kind
And I want you to be mine
I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
Yes I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
