[Verse 1]
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind, felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
[Pre-Chorus]
There's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
[Chorus]
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
[Verse 2]
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers' tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
[Pre-Chorus]
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
That knocks me off my feet
[Chorus]
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling, I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling, I don't want toâ€”
