[Verse 1]
I know it, I can't feel it
Well, I know it enough to believe it
And I know it, I can't see it
But I know it enough to believe it
[Pre-Chorus]
To better you, to better me
My bitter half has bitten me
It's better than you, it's better than me
Sleeping with my enemy
Myself
Myself
[Chorus]
The pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
[Verse 2]
You're hungry, but I'm starving
He cuts you down from the tree
He keeps you in a box by the bed
Alive, but just barely[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'm pure,‚Äù and he hits me again
With a bullet, number one
Kill the family, save the son
Himself
Himself
[Chorus]
The pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Found pieces of Jennifer's body
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep
Now she's mine
