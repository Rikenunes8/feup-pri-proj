[Verse 1]
I decline to walk the line
They tell me that I'm lazy
Worldly wise, I realize
That everybody's crazy
A woman's voice reminds me
To serve and not to speak
Am I myself or just another freak?
[Chorus]
You know there's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd love to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn, no no
[Verse 2]
With a cough, I shake it off
And work around my yellow stripe
Should I hide or eat my pride?
Or wait until it's good and ripe?
My life is boiling over
It's happened once before
I wish someone would open up the door
[Chorus]
Don't you know there's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd love to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Don't you know
There's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd love to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn
[Outro]
Yeah
By-by-by-by-by
