We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
I'm going to Jackson
I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town
Well, go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson
Go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care
Well, when I breeze into that city
People gonna stoop and bow
All them women gonna make me
Teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson
You turn loose my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote
