[Verse 1]
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur, you've got a head like a ghost train
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?
[Chorus]
You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care, because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays till the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight
[Instrumental break]
[Bridge]
Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe
[Bridge]
Bring it on down, bring it out of me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe
[Chorus]
You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care, because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight
