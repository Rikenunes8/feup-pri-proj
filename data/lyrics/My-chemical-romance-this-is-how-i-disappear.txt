[Intro]
Go
[Verse 1]
To un-explain the unforgivable
Drain all the blood and give the kids a show
By streetlight, this dark night, 
a s√©ance down below
There's things that I have done
You never should ever know
[Chorus]
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
[Verse 2]
Who walks among the famous living dead
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
And if you could talk to me, tell me if it's so
That all the good girls go to Heaven
Well, Heaven knows
[Chorus]
That without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
[Bridge]
Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on
, figure out
I'm really not so with you anymore
I'm just a ghost, so I can't hurt you anymore
So I can't hurt you anymore
[Breakdown]
And now
You wanna see how far down
I can sink?
Let me go, 
fuck
So you can
Well, now, so you can
I'm so far away from you
Well, now, so you can[Chorus]
And without you is how I disappear
And without you is how I disappear
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) And without you is how I disappear
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) And without you, forever, forever now
