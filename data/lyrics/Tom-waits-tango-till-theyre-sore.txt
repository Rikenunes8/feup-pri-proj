[Verse 1]
Well you play that tarantella, 
all the hounds will start to roar
The boys all go to hell and then the Cubans hit the floor
They drive along the pipeline, they tango till they're sore
They take apart their nightmares and they leave 'em by the door
[Chorus]
Let me fall out of the window 
with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
And send me off to bed forevermore
[Verse 2]
Make sure they play my theme song, 
I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig
 and kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed till I get back in town
[Chorus]
Let me fall out of the window 
with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
And send me off to bed forevermore
[Verse 3]
Just make sure she's all in 
Calico
 and the color of a doll
Wave the flag on Cadillac Day and a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold your breath till the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood, send me off to another town
[Chorus]
And just let me fall out of the window 
with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
Tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Will you send me off to bed forevermore?
Fall out of the window 
with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Send me off to bed forevermore
Send me off to bed forevermore
