[Verse 1]
Someone woke me up this mornin'
And I lit a cigarette
Found myself when I stopped yawnin'
Started getting myself dressed
Then I felt that I had a dream
I remembered the things I'd seen
I could still hear the things you said
With that bad dream in my head
[Chorus]
It was a sad day
Bad day
Sad day
Bad day
[Verse 2]
So I called you on the phone
And your friend said, "She's not home"
So I told her where I'd be at
And that you should call me back
Then I looked at the morning mail
I was not even expecting a bill
Your letter a-started "Dear"
And it left me with these tears
[Chorus]
It was a sad day
Bad day
Sad day
Bad day
[Verse 3]
Think of the times that we had rows
But we patched them up somehow
Think of the times I tried to go
But you screamed and told me "No"There is only one thing in this world
That I can't understand, that's a girl
I keep a-readin' the things you said
Like a bad dream in my head
[Chorus]
It was a sad day
Bad day
Sad day
Bad day
[Outro]
Oh, what a sad, sad, old day
A sad old day
It was a sad old day
A sad old day. it was a bad old day
A sad old day, a bad old day
If there is one awful thing in this world
That I can't understand, that's a girl
It was a sad, sad old day, sad old day
It was a sad old day
