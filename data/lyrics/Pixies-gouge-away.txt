[Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm, mhm, mhm, hm
Hm-hm, mhm, hm
[Verse 1: Black Francis]
Missy aggravation
Some sacred questions
You stroke my locks
Some marijuana if you got some
[Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
La, la
Oh, oh
[Verse 2: Black Francis]
Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms
You spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers[Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
]
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm
[Verse 3: Black Francis]
Chained to the pillars
A 3-day party
I break the walls
And kill us all with holy fingers
[Chorus: Black Francis]
Gouge away (La la)
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
