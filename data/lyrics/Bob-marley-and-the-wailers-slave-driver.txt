[Intro]
Ooooohhhhh Oooohhhh Ooohhh-Oohh Oooohhhh Ooohhh
Oohh Oooohhhh Ooohhh
[Chorus]
Slave Driver
The table has turned (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
So you can get burned now
(Catch a fire)
Slave Driver
The table has turned (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
You're going to get burned
(Catch a fire)
Woah Now
[Verse 1]
Everytime I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize our very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good God, I think it's illiteracy
It's only a machine that make money
[Chorus]
(Slave Driver)
The table has turned, y'all
(Ooooohhhhh Oooohhhh Ooohhh)
(Slave Driver, ugh)
The table has turned, baby now! (Catch a fire)
(Catch a fire)
So you can get burned, baby now! (Catch a fire)
(Slave Driver)
The table is turned y'all (Catch a fire)
(Catch a fire)
So you can get burned now (Catch a fire)[Verse 2]
Every time I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize our very souls
(Ooooohhhhh Oooohhhh Ooohhh-Oohh Oooohhhh Ooohhh)
Oh God have mercy on our souls!
(Oohh Oooohhhh Ooohhh)
Oh!
[Chorus]
Slave Driver
The Table has turned, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a Fire (Catch a fire)
So you can get burned
(Catch a fire)
Slave Driver (Slave driver)
The table has turned, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a FIre
So you can get burned (Catch a fire)
