[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Down, down, down
[Verse 1]
Well I asked my friend, "Where is that black smoke coming from?"
He just coughed and changed the subject and said, "Oh, I think it might snow some"
So I left him sipping his tea and I jumped in my chariot
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time
Sisters and brothers, daddies, mothers standing around crying
When I reached the scene the flames were making a ghostly whine
So I stood on my horse's back and I screamed without a crack
I say, "Oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down?"
[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down
Down, down, down
[Verse 2]
Well, someone stepped from the crowd, he was nineteen miles high
He shouts we're tired and disgusted, so we paint red through the sky
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah
So I finally rode away but I'll never forget that day
Because when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace
And came and taken all the dead away
[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby
