[Intro: SlimKid3 + 
Bootie Brown
]
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, heyya, whassup, yeah
We was like that you 
know
Yeah, and I bet you got laid back
Yeah, I'mma uh, I'm a just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man, don't sweat it, yo, we gonna catch some stuff, dude
Oh no, I'm kinda tired
Nah, we got a basket, we're gonna fill this basket before we go, yo
Aight, bro
'Cause the otha fish is better...
[Verse 1]
It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping
This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was
So she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an umbrella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never simp, pimp, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's other fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is
[Chorus]
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea[Verse 2]
I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind, sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den, B
Macho
, but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?
What's the deal, dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits
He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up your eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That you don't bruise a limb, as you swim with other fish in the sea
In the sea that is
[Chorus]
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea[Verse 3]
Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, 'cause ya thought you captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two bits of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip,
 
Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They're working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar, miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like off to other fish in the sea
[Outro]
In the sea, baby
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
[Over Chorus]
You know there's other, you know that there's other
In the sea, baby
In the sea, baby
In the sea, baby
In the sea, baby
