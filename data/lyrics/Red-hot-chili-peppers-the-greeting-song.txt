[Verse 1]
Drivin' around, I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
[Verse 2]
Makin' my way, I break another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love
[Pre-Chorus]
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music
[Chorus]
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
[Verse 3]
Sought and I found a life of making my blood-sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound, I make it for my love
[Pre-Chorus]
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music[Chorus]
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
