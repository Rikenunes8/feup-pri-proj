[Verse 1]
Separates and lingerie
Seven pairs of shoes
Lots of Woolworth's makeup
A pair of Black Watch trews
Your out-of-tune piano
Sentimental photographs
A million little memories
A million little laughs
[Bridge 1]
The wing on the aeroplane
Has just caught on fire
I say without reservation
We ain't getting no higher
[Verse 2]
All you wanted from me
All I had to give
Nothing matters, you'll see
When in paradise you live
[Bridge 2]
The plane is diving faster
We're getting near the ground
Nobody is screaming
No one makes a sound
[Chorus/Outro]
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl
(Mrs. Walker, it's a girl)
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl
(Mrs. Walker, it's a girl)
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl
