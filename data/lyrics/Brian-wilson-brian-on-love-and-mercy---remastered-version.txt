I was sittin' in a crummy movie
With my hands on my chin
All the violence that occurs
Seems like we never win
Love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
So love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
I was lying in my room
And the news came on TV
A lotta people out there hurtin'
And it really scares me
Love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
Love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
I was standing in a bar
And watching all the people there
Oh, the loneliness in this world
Well it's just not fair
Hey, love and mercy, that's what we need tonight
So love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
Love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
Love and mercy tonight
Love and mercy tonight
