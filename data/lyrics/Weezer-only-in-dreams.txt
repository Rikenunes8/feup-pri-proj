[Verse 1]
You can't resist her, she's in your bones
She is your marrow, and your ride home
You can't avoid her, she's in the air (In the air)
In between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide
[Chorus]
Only in dreams
, we see what it means
Reach out our hands, hold onto hers
But when we wake, it's all been erased
And so it seems, only in dreams
[Verse 2]
You walk up to her, ask her to dance
She says, "Hey, baby, I just might take the chance"
You say, "It's a good thing that you float in the air (in the air)
That way, there's no way I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces"
[Chorus]
Only in dreams, we see what it means
Reach out our hands, hold onto hers
But when we wake, it's all been erased
And so it seems, only in dreams
[Post-Chorus]
Only in dreams, only in dreams, only in dreams
Only in dreams, only in dreams, only in dreams, only in dreams
