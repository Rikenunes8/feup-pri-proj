I've been up, I've been down
I've been so turned around
That I've seen my fate
In the eyes of others
I've been high, I've been low
But there's one thing I know
There's a lot to give
When we give to each other
So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
And turn down the lights
First we're here, then we're gone
But the music plays on
From the heart of one
To the heart of another
It's goodnight, not goodbye
We're just done for awhile
We'll be back again
With some new things discovered
And we'll bring you our song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
Come turn down the lights
So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
Turn up the love
Bring out the memories
You and I could share them all night
So turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
