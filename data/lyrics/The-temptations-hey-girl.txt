[Verse 1: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl, I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey, girl, I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me is going to die
If you say "So long" (Bye bye)
If this is "Goodbye" (Bye bye)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Bye bye)
[Verse 2: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl, this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you? (Bye bye)
And hey, girl, now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone? (Bye bye)
How will I live? (Bye bye)
How can I go on? (Bye bye)
How can I go on? (Bye bye)
Hey, girl
[Verse 3: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl, now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground (Bye bye)
And beg you, hey (Bye bye), beg you to stay (Bye bye)
Don't go away (Bye bye)
[Outro: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl (Hey girl, hey girl)
No, no, don't go away
Hey, girl (Hey girl, hey girl)
Pretty girl, don't go away
I'm begging you to stay (Hey girl, hey girl)
Little girl, don't go away
Hey, girl (Hey girl, hey girl)
Little girl, don't go away
