[Verse 1]
Little Miss Lover
Where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover, yeah
That feels like you, would you like to tag along?
Well, I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Aw, shucks
[Verse 2]
Would you believe, baby
I've been looking for a soul that feels like you for some time
Excuse me while I see
If the gypsy in me is right if you don't mind
Well, he signals me okay, so I think it's safe to say
I'm going to make my play
Aw, yeah
[Bridge]
You see me comin' towards you now
Hey, aw yeah
Aw, give it to her
Oh, get into it
[Outro]
Hey, hey, little miss lover
There is so much you and me can discover
And I think we should start right now
Right now, right now
