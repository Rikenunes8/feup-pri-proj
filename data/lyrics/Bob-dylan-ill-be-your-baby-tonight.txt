[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, close the door
Ya' don’t have to worry anymore
I’ll be your baby tonight
[Verse 2]
Shut the light, shut the shade
Ya' don’t have to be afraid
I’ll be your baby tonight
[Bridge]
Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
We’re gonna forget it
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we’re gonna let it
You won’t regret it
[Verse 3]
Kick your shoes off, do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I’ll be your baby tonight
