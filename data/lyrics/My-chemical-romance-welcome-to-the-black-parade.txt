[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So 
paint it black
 and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call
[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches[Bridge]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
[Breakdown]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on[Outro]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part 
(We'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me
 
(We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart
 
(We'll carry on)
Go and try, you'll never break me 
(We'll carry)
We want it all, we wanna play this part 
(We'll carry on)
