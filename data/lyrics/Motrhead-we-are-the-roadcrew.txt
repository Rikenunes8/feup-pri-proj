Another town, another place
Another girl, another face
Another drug, another race

I'm eating junk, feeling bad
Another night, I'm going mad
My woman's leaving, I feel sad

But I just love the life I lead
Another beer is what I need
Another gig, my ears bleed
We are the road crew

Another town I've left behind
Another drink, completely blind
Another hotel I can't find
Another backstage pass for you
Another tube of super glue
Another border to get through

I'm driving like a maniac
Driving my way to hell and back
Another room a case to pack

We are the road crew


Another hotel we can burn
Another screw, another turn
Another Europe map to learn
Another truckstop on the way
Another game that I can play
Another word I learn to say

Another blasted customs post
Another bloody foreign coast
Another set of scars to boast

We are the road crew

That's right!
