[Verse 1]
Well I'm riding down 
Kingsley
Figuring I'll get a drink
Well I turn the radio up loud
So I don't have to think
And I take her to the floor
Looking for a moment
When the world seems right
And I tear into the guts
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Of something in the night
[Verse 2]
Well you're born with nothing
And better off that way
Soon as you've got something they send
Someone to try and take it away
Well you can ride this road till dawn
Without another human being in sight
Yeah just kids wasted on
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Something in the night
[Bridge]
Well nothing is forgotten or forgiven
When it's your last time around
And I got stuff running 'round my head
That I just can't live down
[Verse 3]
Well we found the things we loved
They were crushed and dying in the dirt
We tried to pick up the pieces
And get away without getting hurt
But they caught us at the state line
Burned our cars in one last fight
And left us running burned and blind
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Chasing something in the night
