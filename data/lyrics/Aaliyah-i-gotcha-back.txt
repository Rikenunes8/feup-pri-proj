[Verse 1]
I got the women always wonder how I keep a man
They've been trying for so long
And still don't understand
It's not the things I say, it's the way I say it
That keeps them locked down, nowhere to go
And on top of that, I let him know
[Chorus]
I'm down for whatever (Down)
No matter how you act (Oh, yeah)
You never have to worry 'bout a thing
I gotcha' back (I gotcha' back)
When no one else is there (Baby), with me you can chill
'Cause it feels real good
When you know somebody's got your back
I gotcha' back
[Verse 2]
I'm the type when I find a man I like
It's on and poppin', ain't no stoppin' the things I do for you
No complications, baby, keep it real
Do onto to me, as I do, and everything will be cool
When you find yourself in times of trouble
Remember that I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
[Chorus]
I'm down for whatever (Oh)
No matter how you act (Yeah)
You never have to worry 'bout a thing (No)
I gotcha' back (Yeah)
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody's got your back
I gotcha' back (Oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I'm down for whatever (Down)
No matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing
You don't have to worry, baby (I gotcha' back)
When no one else is there (When no one)
With me you can chill
'Cause it feels real good
When you know somebody's got your back
I gotcha' back
