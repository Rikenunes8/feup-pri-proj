[Verse 1]
Are we fools for rushing in?
'Cause I already dread the end
Lonely ain't no place to start
I guess that's just where we are
Oh, how I remember well
The sunset on September 12th
I disappeared to get a drink
You still kept your eyes on me
[Chorus]
Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
[Verse 2]
I didn't plan on falling fast
I didn't know I could be kissed like that
Now I'm trading miles for minutes
This bed's too big without you in it
[Chorus]
Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
You and I are pushin' time
[Verse 3]
And they say only time can tell
You already know me well
If it has to end in tears
I hope it's in 60 years
[Chorus]
Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
