Whatever you want, whatever you need
Anything you want done baby, I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman
It's all in me, it's all in me
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z
I can cast a spell of secrets you can tell
Mix a special brew, put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear, 'cause
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
Oh, I can sense your needs like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it, I got it, got it, baby, baby
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z
I ain't braggin', 'cause I'm the one
Just ask me, ooh, and it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
I've got it, I've got it, got it got it, got it
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
