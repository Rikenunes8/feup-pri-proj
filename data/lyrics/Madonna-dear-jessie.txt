[Verse 1]
Baby face, don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic lantern
He will make your dreams come true for you
Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true
[Chorus]
Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade
[Verse 2]
If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade
[Chorus]
Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade
[Post-Chorus]
Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade
[Bridge]
On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there[Pre-Chorus]
Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade
[Chorus]
Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade
[Post-Chorus]
Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade
