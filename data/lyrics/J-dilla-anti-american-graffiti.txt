My family tree, my family, it's my history, my family
My family tree, my family, it's my history
Ah! Ah!
What's up... he-hey baby!
Have mercy, have mercy, you bet your life, baby!
That's right, I'm down here, with the world's most popular drinking areas, you understand?
The South Pole Lounge. Yes, yes!
Where everything is nice, and they do it twice
And everybody here's waitin' for the million-dollar jackpot number to come up, man!
And you know, there's a lot of sincere confusion about just what the doctor said!
Too much, too soon!
Yes, yes!
Straight sounding like the end of the world all over again, man!
Six to five of the working people I talk to wanna know
Who's gonna take the responsibility, Bingle?
Say it, say it!
Too much, too soon!
Yes, yes!
Say it, say it!
Oh, God!
