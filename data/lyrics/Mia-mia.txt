[Intro]
1-2, 1-2
[Verse 1]
You can watch TV and watch the media
President Bush doing takeover
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
All my youth the young offender
The bill payers, the drug dealers
Girls who are magazine covers
The part-time jobbers at the call center
No career plans 'cause you won't go far
Put away change for Ibiza and
Check your credit on your new Nokia
[Hook]
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'
[Post-Chorus]
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?
[Verse 2]
You're prime minister to your employer
Ego lovers need more power
The trendsetters make things better
Don't sell out to be product pushers
The gyro casher and baby makers
Try something new cause it ain't over
All poor people from all over
Lottery's got a rollover
[Hook]
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'[Post-Chorus]
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?
[Bridge]
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?
[Outro]
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out here, I need to get paid
Hmm, hmm-mm-mm, hmm-mm-mm, anarchy
Uhh, uhh-uh-uh, uh-uh they don't check me
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?
