[Verse 1]
The telephone's not answered
So many times you'll call
For many different reasons
So many tears will fall
[Chorus]
Before you find your love
Before it comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
[Verse 2]
So many fears will haunt you
Deny them or regret
Some men will make you want to
And you will not forget
[Chorus]
Before you find your love
Before it comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
[Post-Chorus]
There's a story of a man who loved too much
He ended up inside a prison cell
You've got to want to give to get it
Or you could land up in the same suspicious hell
It's happened before (before, before, before)
It's happened before (before, before)
[Verse 3]
Coincidence and patience
Will mend this fatal flaw
Though it may seem a long wait
Others have been here[Chorus]
Before you find your love
Before it comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
[Post-Chorus]
One day when the phone starts ringing
You'll answer to the words you're longing for
No tears, no trade, no prison cell
Whatever you need, he will return more
It's happened before (before, before, before)
It's happened before (before, before)
[Chorus]
You find your love
Before it comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
You find your love
Before it comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
[Outro]
It's happened before (before, before, before)
It's happened before (before, before)
