[Verse 1]
Well, I came by your house the other day
Your mother said you went away
She said there was nothing that I could have done
There was nothing nobody could say
Me and you, we've known each other
Yeah, ever since we were sixteen
I wished I would have known
I wished I could have called you
Just to say "Goodbye, Bobby Jean"
[Verse 2]
Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their nose
We liked the same music
We liked the same bands
We liked the same clothes
We told each other that we were the wildest
The wildest things we'd ever seen
Now I wished you would have told me
I wished I could have talked to you
Just to say "Goodbye, Bobby Jean"
[Bridge]
Now we went walking in the rain
Talking about the pain from the world we hid
Now there ain't nobody, nowhere, nohow
Gonna ever understand me the way you did[Verse 3]
Well maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere
In some bus or train traveling along
In some motel room there'll be a radio playing
And you'll hear me sing this song
Well if you do, you'll know I'm thinking of you
And all the miles in between
And I'm just calling one last time, not to change your mind
But just to say "I miss you baby. Good luck. Goodbye, Bobby Jean"
