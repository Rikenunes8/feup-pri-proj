[Verse 1]
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine
[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play
[Chorus]
We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Till the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
[Verse 2]
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
You got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play
[Chorus]
We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Till the life I knew comes to my house and says...[Outro]
Hello, hello
It's good to be back, it's good to be back
Hello, hello
It's good to be back, it's good to be back
Hello, hello
It's good to be back, it's good to be back
Hello, hello, hello
