[Verse]
Well I was happy here at home, I've got everything I need
Happy being on my own, just living the life I lead
Well suddenly it dawned on me that this was not my life
So I just phoned the airline girl and said
Get me on flight number 505
Get me on flight number 505
[Verse 2]
Well I confirmed my reservation, then I hopped a cab
No idea of my destination and feeling pretty bad
With my suitcase in my hand and in my head my new life
So then I told the airline girl, well
Get me on flight number 505
Get me on flight number 505
All right
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Well I sat right there in my seat, well, feeling like a king
With the whole world right at my feet, of course I'll have a drink
Well suddenly I saw that we never ever would arrive
He put the plane down in the sea
The end of flight number 505
The end of flight number 505
All right
[Outro]
They put the plane down in the sea
The end of flight number 505
The end of flight number 505
