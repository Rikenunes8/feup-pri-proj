{Intro}
[Verse 1]
Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right
[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know
[Verse 3]
Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on
[Verse 4]
This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song
[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know[Bridge 1]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Heartache, baby
{Instrumental Bridge}
[Verse 1]
Somebody's gonna hurt someone (somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
 (everybody)
[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right
[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Let's go[Bridge 2]
We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way
[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know (Lord, I know)
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Woo-woo!
{Outro}
(Break my heart, baby)
