When you left me this mornin'
You taken my heart away
When you left me this mornin'
You taken my heart away
That's alright baby
You will come back home someday
How long?
Baby how long, how long?
How long?
Baby how long, how long?
You know I love you
You started doin' me wrong
Well when you leave home
You can call me on your phone
Well when you leave home
You can call me on your phone
I'll sent you your money
Darlin' you come back home
(Oh come back)
How long have you gon do me wrong?
How long have you gon do me wrong?
Ain't nobody never lived that
Didn't do somebody wrong
