[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm going to miss you
But believe while I'm away
That I didn't mean to hurt you
Don't you know that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself, I'd hurt myself)
[Verse]
Baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Think of me sometimes (Baby)
Because if loving you was so wrong (Baby)
Then I'm guilty of this crime
(Guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty)
I'm bewildered, I'm lonely, and I'm loveless
Without you to hold my hand
(Reach out for me, boy)
If you'd just understand
(Reach out to me, right now)
Those that we love, we foolishly make cry
Then sometimes feel it's best to say goodbye, goodbye
But what's inside can't be denied
The power (Power of love)
The power of love (Power of love)
Is my only guide
Baby (Oh)
Baby (Oh)
Baby (Oh)
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm going to miss you
But believe while I'm away
(I need you, I need you, I need you)
That I really didn't mean, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to hurt you
Don't you know that, that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself)
[Outro]
Baby, I need you, I need you, I need you
If I did you wrong, if I did you wrong
(I'd hurt myself)
I need you, I need you, I need you
If I did you wrong
(I'd hurt myself)
