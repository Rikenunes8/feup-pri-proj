[Chorus]
Well, there ain't no
(Ain't no)
Ain't no telling, baby
When you will see me again, but I pray
It will be tomorrow
[Chorus]
Well, the sunrise
(Sunrise)
Is burning my eyes, baby
Well now, I must leave now, but I really hope
To see you tomorrow, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, my house is oh, such a sad mile away
The feeling there always hangs up my day
Oh Cleopatra, she's driving me insane
She's trying to put my body in her brain
So uh, just uh, kiss me
Goodbye, just to ease the pain
[Chorus]
Ain't no
(Ain't no)
Ain't no telling, baby
(Ain't no telling, babe)
Ain't no telling, baby
When you gonna see me, I really hope
That uh, it will be tomorrow
You know what I'm talking about
(Ain't no telling)
[Outro]
Woah yeah
Hope it will be, hope it will be tomorrow
(Ain't no telling)
Ain't no telling baby, yeah
You know what I'm talking about
Anyway, I must leave now
