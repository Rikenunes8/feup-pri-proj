[Verse 1]
Sitting in the classroom, feel your heart going boom
You start to get the feeling and your head begins to reeling
And you can't hear what the teachers say
'Cause the news is going down about the rock n roll dance in town
And you know I just gotta hear that band play
[Chorus]
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Oh, tonight
[Verse 2]
Tuesday got the letter, the army thinks I better
Get myself down there right away
It's not that I'm lazy, I'm just too crazy
To be going doing things that way
Because the kids will be in town and the jams will be going down
I wanna do things the natural way
[Chorus]
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Oh, tonight
[Bridge]
Every day you can hear 'em say
You gotta get down in the USA tonight
Okay kids, it's rocking time!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Every day you can hear 'em say
You gotta get down in the USA tonight
Okay kids, it's rocking time![Verse 3]
Sun starts going down, I call my girl up on the phone
Said I'll pick you up at eight, at last we'll be alone
I hop in my machine, you know I gotta make the scene
Dancing through the crowd, see the people going wild
When the band's really rocking, there's just no stopping
My girl begins to twirl, the room begins to whirl
It's out of this world, it's out of this world
[Chorus]
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
Oh, tonight
[Outro]
Hey now everybody, I got to get moving
I gotta muscle me up some action
Well, I'll see you all later
Well bye bye
