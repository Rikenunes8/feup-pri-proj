[Verse 1: Group, 
Brian Wilson
, 
Mike Love
]
Please don't let me argue anymore
I won't make you worry like before
Can't remember what we fought about
Late late last night we said it was over
But I remember when we thought it out
We both had a broken heart
[Chorus: Mike Love, 
Group
]
Woah Baby 
(Kiss me Baby)
Woah Baby 
(Love to hold you)
Woah Baby 
(Kiss me baby)
Woah Baby 
(Love to hold you)

As I drove away I felt a tear
It hit me I was losing someone dear
Told my folks I would be alright
Tossed and I turned, my head was so heavy
Then I wondered as it got light
Were you still awake like me?
[Chorus]
