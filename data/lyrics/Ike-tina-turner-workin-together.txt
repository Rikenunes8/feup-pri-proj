Calling out to all my sisters and brothers
Regardless of race, creed or color...
The problems of the world will never be solved
Unless we put a little love in our hearts...
Workin' together, we can make a change,
Workin' together, we can help better things
So let us put our hate aside
And let us let love be our guide...
Let's now try a little love for a change...
Just try a little love for a change...
People disliking one another
Because we were born of a different color...
Many are protesting the wars across the sea
'Cause there are people here that are still not free...
Workin' together, we can make a change,
Workin' together, we can help better things
So let us put our hate aside
And let us let love be our guide...
Say, let's try a little love for a change...
Let's try a little love for a change...
Unless we get together, the world would never survive
And the hopes for the world will surely, surely die...
People like you and me should speak up for what is right,
Only then will the world see the light...
Workin' together, we can make a change,
Workin' together, we can help better things
Let us put our hate aside
And let us let love be our guide...
Say, let's try a little love for a change...
Let's try a little love for a change...
Try a little love for a change... (Workin' together, we can make a change...)
Oh, let's try a little love for a change... (Workin' together, we can help better things...)
If we stick together, we'll make things better, yeah, yeah, yeah... (Workin' together, we can make a change...)
Oh, but we got to try a little love for a change... (Workin' together, we can help better things...)
Ooh, try a little love, a little bit of love, (Workin' together, we can make a change...)
Try a little love, love, love, love... (Workin' together, we can help better things...)
