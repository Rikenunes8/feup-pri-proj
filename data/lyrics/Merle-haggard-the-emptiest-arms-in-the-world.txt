[Verse 1]
I only call when I've had that one too many
And my lonely room goes spinning in a whirl
And tonight I couldn't even find my pillow
[Chorus]
I've got the emptiest arms in the world
[Verse 2]
I no longer wear the gold band on my finger
And from time to time I find myself a girl
But when I realize that she's not you I'm holding
[Chorus]
I've got the emptiest arms in the world
[Verse 3]
Empty arms won't ever hold you close again
And these cheap hotels they're like a prison cell that keeps closing in
[Chorus]
And you alone can fill this lonely feeling
Of the emptiest arms in the world
And you alone can fill this lonely feeling
Of the emptiest arms in the world
