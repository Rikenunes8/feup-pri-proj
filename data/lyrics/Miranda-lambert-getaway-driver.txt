[Verse 1]
When she's feeling reckless
Tangled in her messes
Wild eyes lookin' for a chase
There's nothing white lines can't erase
[Chorus]
So I keep the engine running
She'll be my gasoline
She treats my heart like a stolen car
All the while she had the keys
Standing in the line of fire
I'll be right beside her
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver
[Verse 2]
Miles were the only thing that saved us
Headlights were our only traces
No rear-view mirror, no looking back
Desert horizon as our map
[Chorus]
So I keep the engine running
She'll be my gasoline
She treats my heart like a stolen car
All the while she had the keys
Standing in the line of fire
I'll be right beside her
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver
[Outro]
A lover and a fighter
Bonnie and Clyde reminder
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver
