[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life
[Pre-Chorus]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie
[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal
, 
not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life[Pre-Chorus]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life
[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh
[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
