In crowded bars
Past subway cars
Whenever you're next to me
Center of gravity
Can't feel both feet on the ground
Walking home after dark
Past the softball park
Whenever you're next to me
Center of gravity
Can't feel both feet on the ground
It's clear to me
According to a rule
I learned one day in school
Basic geometry
Two halves make a circle
You and me
It's a familiar song
We've known so long
Your clever cuts into me
As long as you're next to me
Can't feel both feet on the ground
Whenever you're next to me
Center of gravity
Can't feel both feet on the ground
