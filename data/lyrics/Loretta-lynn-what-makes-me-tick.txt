Gonna have my head examined
'Cause my mind is in bad shape
The way that you've been actin'
I think that you've gone ape
The way I let you treat me
It's enough to make me sick
I'm gonna have my head examined
And find out what makes me tick
If I had the brains of a dummy
I'd be smart
'Cause there ain't no feelin'
In a poor dummy's heart
And when it comes to cheatin'
Honey, you know every trick
I'm gonna have my head examined
And find out what makes me tick
Gonna have my head examined
'Cause I know my mind is broke
Tonight I saw you kiss her
You said, "Can't you take a joke?"
Now, I won't be your monkey
You'd better change in quick
I'm gonna have my head examined
And find out what makes me tick
If I had the brains of a dummy
I'd be smart
'Cause there ain't no feelin'
In a poor dummy's heart
And when it comes to cheatin'
Honey, you know every trick
I'm gonna have my head examined
And find out what makes me tick
I'm gonna have my head examined
And find out what makes me tick
