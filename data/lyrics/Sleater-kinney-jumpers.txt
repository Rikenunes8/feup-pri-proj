[Verse 1]
I spend the afternoon in cars
I sit in traffic jams for hours
Don't push me, I am not OK
The sky is blue most every day
The lemons grow like tumors, theyâ€”
Are tiny suns infused with sour
[Chorus]
Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent
[Verse 2]
The only substance is the fog
And it hides all that has gone wrong
Can't see a thing inside the maze
There is a bridge adored and famed
The Golden spine of engineering
Whose back is heavy with my weight
[Chorus]
Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent
[Bridge]
Be still this old heart
Be still this old skin
Drink your last drink
Sin your last sin
Sing your last song
About the beginning
Sing it out loud
So the people can hear, let's go
Be still this sad day
Be still this sad year
Hope your last hope
Fear your last fear
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one, let's go
[Verse 3]
My falling shape will draw a line
Between the blue of sea and sky
I'm not a bird, I'm not a plane
I took a taxi to the Gate
I will not go to school again
Four seconds was the longest wait
[Outro]
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest
