Oh my baby been crying
Oh she want me to come home
Oh my baby is crying
Oh she want me to come home
You been gone so long
You been gone so long
Oh I wished I had
Oh my baby in my arms
Oh I wished I had
Oh my little baby in my arms
She said you been gone
She said you been gone
So long
Well I ain't gonna tell my baby
Oh when I'm coming home
Oh ain't gonna tell my baby
Oh when I'm coming home
She said you been gone so long
She said you been gone so long
I want you home
