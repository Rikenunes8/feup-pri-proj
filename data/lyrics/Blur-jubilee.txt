[Verse 1]
Jubilee slouches in the settee
He's losing all will to move
He gone divvy, too much telly
He watching twenty-four hours of rubbish
He got butane, he got plastic bags
His eyes are going square, oh yeah
He no raver, just anti-social
He no going to cut his hair
[Chorus]
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how
Seventeen
, he not mean enough
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how
Seventeen, he not keen on being like anyone else
[Verse 2]
Jubilee's dad, Billy Banker
Thinks his son's a slob
He should get out more, stop scabbing
He really should go and get a job
[Chorus]
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how to do it
Seventeen, he not mean enough
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how
Where to go, but he just don't get out enough
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how to do it
Talk to girls, but he's just too spotty
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how
Seventeen, he not keen on being like anyone else
So he just plays on his computer game
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how to do it
Seventeen, he not mean enough
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how
Where to go, but he just don't get out enough
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how to do it
Talk to girls, but he's just too spotty
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him how
Seventeen, he not keen on being like anyone[Outro]
He's not being like anyone
Jubilee is not like anyone else
