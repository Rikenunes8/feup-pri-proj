[Verse]
Thank you for the days
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me
I'm thinking of the days
I won't forget a single day, believe me
I bless the light
I bless the light that shines on you, believe me
And though you're gone
You're with me every single day, believe me
[Bridge 1]
Days I remember all my life
Days where you can't see wrong from right
You took my life
And then I knew that very soon you'd leave me
But it's alright
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me
[Bridge 2]
I wish today could be tomorrow
The night is dark
It just brings sorrow, let it wait
[Verse]
Thank you for the days
Those endless days those sacred days you gave me
I'm thinking of the days
I won't forget a single day, believe me
I bless the light (I bless the light)
I bless the light that shines on you, believe me
(I bless the light)
And though you're gone (I bless the light)
You're with me every single day, believe me (I bless the light)
(I bless the light)
