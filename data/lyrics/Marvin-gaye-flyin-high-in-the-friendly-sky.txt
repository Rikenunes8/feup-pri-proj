[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain
[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh, but I go crazy when I can't find it
Well I know I'm hooked my friend
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
And oh, believe me
[Outro]
Flying high in a friendly sky
Flying high in a friendly sky
