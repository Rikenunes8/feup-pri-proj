[Verse 1]
Early in the evenin', just about supper time
Over by the courthouse, they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp
[Chorus]
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
[Verse 2]
Rooster hits the 
washboard,
 and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the 
gut bass
 and solos for a while
Poor boy twangs the rhythm out on his 
Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo
[Chorus]
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
[Verse 3]
You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner, there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy
[Outro]
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feetDown on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'â€¦
