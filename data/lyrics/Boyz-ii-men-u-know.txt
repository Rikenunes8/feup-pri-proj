[Verse 1: Michael]
I heard you're gonna leave me
I've known it for awhile
I wasn't naive to the news my mind just couldn't walk a mile
I only see you with me cause I know the things you like
I know all that you believe and all the plans of your life
So take a minute to understand me, to re-evaluate your mind
I'm everything you need and in this world
A good man is hard to find
And I know you'll miss me
When all is said and done
You'll think about this day and then you'll realize I was the one
[Chorus: All]
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, oh)
And baby, U know
I can't be denied girl, u know
Ooh u know, u know
[Verse 2: Shawn & Wanya]
Gave you all a man can give you
Made sure I found the time to keep it all together
But the way you're treating me ain't right (Can't understand it)
Why you doing me the way you do it
Do you enjoy to see our love fade away
Can't face the world without ya
Can't even sleep at night
Gave you all that I treasured
And I tried to love you with all my might
And I know you'll miss me when all is said and done
You'll think about this day and realize that I was the one
U know
[Chorus: All]
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, o)
U know
I can't be denied girl u know
U know, u know
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, o)
U know
I can't be denied girl u know
U know, u know[Bridge: All]
You Know
You Know
You Know
I can't be tonight girl U know
U know, U know...
(oh yea)
(oohhhhhhh)
U know...
[Chorus: All]
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
That my love's alright (ohhh, o)
U know
I can't be denied girl u know
U know, u know
