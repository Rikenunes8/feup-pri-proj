[Verse 1]
You know I'm bad, the times I've had
I've got a bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation
I don't
[Chorus 1]
The more I get, the better it is
I like it fine, I like a little whizz
Treat them like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch
You know
[Verse 2]
The silver tongued Devil, demon letch
I know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing
I ain't
[Chorus 2]
I love you, baby
Know you're too much
I like it fine, I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know the chase is better than the catch
You know
[Verse 3]
A little beauty, I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I wanna shake your tree
They know
[Chorus 3]
Come on, honey, touch me right there
Come on, honey, don't you get scared
Come on, honey, let me get you in the sack
You know the chase is better than the catch
You know[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Alright, ba-ba-bam
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
I can't hear ya
I can't hear ya
I can't hear ya
I can't hear
