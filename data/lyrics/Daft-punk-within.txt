[Verse 1]
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
[Chorus]
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
[Verse 2]
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
(Where are the locks to try the key?)
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
(And I wonder why)
[Chorus]
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
