Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
I wanna run, but there's nowhere to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
'Cause you've taken away my reasons for living
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute
Didn't I treat you right now, baby
Didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could now, baby
Didn't I?
So don't you leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Just trying my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
May come today, in fact, may come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now don't your conscience kinda bother you?
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you?
Now hold on a minute
Gave you all the love I had now
Didn't I?
When you needed me, I was always there now
Wasn't I?
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
You know crying, it ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause you all this grief?
What did I say to make you wanna leave?
Now wait a minuteGave my heart and soul to you, baby
Didn't I?
And didn't I always treat you good now
Didn't I?
I'm standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Trying my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
I'm standing in the shadows of love...
