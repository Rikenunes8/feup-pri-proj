[Verse]
I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear I'm going crazy
Sitting here all alone
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
I ain't slept a wink since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue Monday
Since you've been away
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, there goes a teardrop
Rolling down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
[Chorus]
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train going
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, there goes a teardrop
Rolling down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
[Chorus]
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues[Outro]
Since you're gone I got a mess of blues
Since you're gone I got a mess of blues
