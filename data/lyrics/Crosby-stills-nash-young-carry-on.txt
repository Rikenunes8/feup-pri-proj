One morning I woke up and I knew
You were really gone
A new day, a new way
And new eyes to see the dawn
Go your way, I'll go mine
And carry on

The sky is clearing and the night
Has gone out
The sun, he come, the world
Is all full of love
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice
But to carry on

The fortunes of fables are able
To sing the song
Now witness the quickness with which
We get along
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues
And carry on

Carry on
Love is coming
Love is coming to us all


Where are you going now, my love?
Where will you be tomorrow?
Will you bring me happiness?
Will you bring me sorrow?

Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams
What you do with what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?

Girl, when I was on my own
Chasing you down
What was it made you run?
Trying your best just to get around

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?
