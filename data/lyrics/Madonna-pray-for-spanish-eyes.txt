[Verse 1]
I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back
I know he cannot see my hands trembling
I know he hears me sing
[Chorus]
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes
[Verse 2]
He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio
, all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand
At least he was a man
[Chorus]
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes
[Refrain]
How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes, when will they ever learn
?
[Verse 3]
You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight, but we cannot win this blind
Stand your gun's against the wall
Who's next in line to fall?[Chorus]
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes
[Interlude]
Tus lagrimas de tristeza
No me dejan olvidarte
[Refrain]
How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes, when will they ever learn?
