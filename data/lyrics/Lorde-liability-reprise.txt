[Intro]
I'm a liability, I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no, no, no, no
And what ya gonna do? Whoa
[Verse]
All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you, ayy
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing, "Woo-hoo"
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe, oh no
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently
[Outro]
But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(
Liability
) But you're not what you thought you were
(
Much for me
) But you're not what you thought you were
Leave
