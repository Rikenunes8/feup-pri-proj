[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I'd wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Although your world wonders me
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your 
people
 I do not understand
So to you I shall put an end
Then you'll never hear surf music again
