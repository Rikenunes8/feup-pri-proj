The wall is high, the black barn
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop
Little sister
, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind
Little sister, the fates are calling on you
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me
Oh baby, I remember when you were born
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash
And the sky split and the planets hit
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind
Little sister, the fates are calling on you
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me
Your soul was like a network of spittle
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic
And I prayed as the lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack
The palm trees fall into the sea
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly
And I can gaze deep
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
Into your starry eyes, oh
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, ohOh, looking deep in your eyes, baby
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
