[Verse 1]
Quiet
I am sleeping
In here
We need a little hope
For years
I’ve been sleeping
Helpless
Couldn’t tell a soul
[Chorus]
Be ashamed
Of the mess you’ve made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me
[Verse 2]
Silent
Metal mercies
Castrate
Boys to the bone
Jesus
Are you listening
Up there
To anyone at all?
[Pre-Chorus]
We are the fossils
The relics of our time
We mutilate the meanings
So they’re easy to deny
[Chorus]
Be ashamed
Of the mess you’ve made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Quiet (Quiet)
I am sleeping
Quiet (Quiet)
I am sleeping
Quiet ([Spoiled]?)
I don’t trust
You ([Spoiled]?)
I can’t hear you now[Chorus]
Be ashamed
Of the mess you’ve made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me
[Outro]
Behind me the grace of falling snow
Cover up everything you know
Come save me from the awful sound
Of nothing
