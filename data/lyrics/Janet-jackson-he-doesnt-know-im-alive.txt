[Intro]
Cha
No, no
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh, baby
[Verse 1]
I've got his picture
It's on my dresser
Right next to my bed
He doesn't know me
But I sure know him
I can't get him out of my head, no
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Talk to him?
No, no, I haven't even tried
[Chorus]
He doesn't even know that I'm alive, no
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
[Verse 2]
I got his number
I call him up
Just to hear him say, "Hello"
And when he answers
I always hang up
Ooh, that boy scares me so, woah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Talk to him?
No, no, I haven't even tried
[Chorus]
He doesn't even know that I'm alive (He doesn't even know that I'm alive)
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
No, no
No, no, no, no
No, no[Bridge]
Someday I'll find the nerve
To talk to him and stop acting so reserved
I told myself, girl, you gotta change
'Cause nothing ventured is nothing gained, oh
[Verse 3]
Late last evening
I dropped on by
Just to see if he was home
And when he opened the door
I coulda died
There we were all alone
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Talk to him?
I said, "Excuse me, I thought my friend lived here"
[Chorus]
Well, he doesn't even know that I'm alive (He doesn't know that I'm alive)
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive (He doesn't know that I'm alive)
He doesn't even know (He doesn't know), I'm alive
[Outro]
No, no, no, no (No)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no
