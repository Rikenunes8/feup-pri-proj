[Verse 1]
Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last
[Verse 2]
So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see
[Verse 3]
So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
