Sitting in my life-guard seat
Out here in the sun and heat
Watching that the little girls don't drown
Radios are everywhere
The only song that I can hear
Is that little old song that's goin' around
Sayin'
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
Someone get a Coke for me
Baby can't you see
How appreciative I would be
'Cause the fun goes better
And the sun goes better
Everyone goes better
With Coke
The real-life one puts extra fun
In everything you do
Don (spoken): Coke has a taste you never get tired of, Coke after Coke
Sitting with my whistle thong
Listenin' to that crazy song
Coca-Cola is really on my mind
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
The heat goes better
And the beat goes better
Coca-Cola makes things more fun
But baby, what gets me
Is why don't you bring me some
"Don't you leave your stand" I'm told
Won't you bring me somethin' cold
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
Voice/announcer: The Everly Brothers are making the scene
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
Life is much more fun
With you're refreshed and
Coke refreshes you best
Fun goes better
With food goes better
With you go better
With Coke
Coke has a taste you never get tired of
Coke after Coke after Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
