[Verse]
You'll never know I cried when I found out you lied
For I've been hiding all these teardrops in my heart (
In my heart
)
My eyes dare not reveal the way I really feel
Because I know I'll cry my heart out if I start (
If I start
)
Though I'm pretending that I don't care
To be with you, my darling, is my prayer (
Is my prayer
)
But way down deep inside, I can't give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart (
In my heart
)
[Outro]
But way down deep inside, I can't give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart (
In my heart
)
