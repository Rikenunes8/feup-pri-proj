[Verse 1]
Well, now, we're respected in society
We don't worry about the things that we used to be
We're talking heroin with the president
Yes, there's a problem, sir, but it can't be bent
Ah, yes
Well, now, you're a pillar of society
You don't worry 'bout the things that you used to be
You're a rag-trade girl, you're the queen of porn
You're the easiest lay on the White House lawn
Get out of my life, don't come back
Get out of my life, don't come back
[Chorus]
She's so respectable, she's so respectable
She's so delectable, she's so respectable
Get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back
Get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back
What I say
[Chorus]
She's so respectable, she's so respectable
She's so respectable, so respectable
Get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back
Oh, get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back
Alright, boys
[Chorus]
She's so respectable, she's so respectable
She's so delectable, she's so respectable
Get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back (Woo)
Get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back
Get out of my life, don't take my wife, don't come back
Come back, ow
