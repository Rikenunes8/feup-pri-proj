Some nights I go to sleep without you
The river's far too deep without you
I can't make it alone, I need you by my side
Some nights I spend alone without you
The river's far too wide without you
I can't make it alone, I need you by my side
I'll never leave you alone
I'll never leave just a memory
I'll never leave you alone in the garden
Where nothing grows
I love you so much baby
I'll never leave you alone
I'll never leave just a memory
I'll never leave you alone in the garden
Where nothing grows
I love you so much baby
