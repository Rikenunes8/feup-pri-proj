No affection were the words that stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me for the very last time
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
I don't know what I've done to be treated this way
In a cold dirty room, that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
I don't know what I've done and I'm feeling so ashamed
Then an angel appeared, she was just seventeen
In a dirty old gown with a conscious so clean
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
She's brought back the life that I once threw away
She's brought back the life that I once threw away
