[Verse 1]
To have and not to hold
So hot, yet so cold
My heart is in your hand
And yet you never stand
Close enough for me to have my way
[Verse 2]
To love but not to keep
To laugh, not to weep
Your eyes, they go right through
And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame
[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram, abahu purusakaram)
[Verse 3]
To look but not to see
To kiss but never be
The object of your desire
I'm walking on a wire
And there's no one at all
To break my fall
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have (And yet you never do)
Not to hold
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame
[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(And yet you never do)[Outro]
You're to have
Not to hold
(To break my fall)
Mmm
(Only I am to blame)
(Only I am to blame)
(Am to blame)
(Abahu purusakaram)
(Abahu purusakaram)
