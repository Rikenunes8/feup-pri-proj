[Verse 1]
Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow
Another cue for you to fold your ears
Another train of thought too hard to follow
Chuggin' along to a song that belongs to the shifting of gears
[Chorus]
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love
To your love
[Verse 2]
I would've warned you, but really, what's the point?
Caution could but rarely ever helps
Don't be down, my demeanor tends to disappoint
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself
[Chorus]
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love
To your love[Bridge]
My derring-do allows me to
Dance the rigadoon around you
But by the time I'm close to you
I lose my desideratum and now you
[Verse 3]
So now you have it, so tell me baby, what's the word?
Am I your gal or should I get out of town?
I just need to be reassured
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with all that I lay down?
[Chorus]
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love
To your love
[Outro]
To your love
To your love
To your love
To your love
To your love
