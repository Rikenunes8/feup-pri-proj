[Verse 1]
What you did to me made me see myself
Something different
And though I try to talk sense to myself
But I just won't listen
Won't you go away, turn yourself in
You're no good at confession
Before the image that you burned me in
Tries to teach you a lesson
[Verse 2]
What you did to me made me see myself
Something awful
A voice once 
stentorian
 is 
now again
Meek and muffled
It took me such a long time to get back up
The first time you did it
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems
I've been out-bidded
[Chorus 1]
My peace and quiet was stolen from me
When I was looking with calm affection
You were searching out my imperfections
What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff
[Verse 3]
You came upon me like a 
hypnic jerk
When I was just about settled
And when it counts, you recoil with a cryptic word
And leave a love belittled
[Chorus 2]
Oh what a cold and common old way to go
When I was feeding on the need for you to know me
Devastated at the rate you fell below me
What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff
Oh, well
