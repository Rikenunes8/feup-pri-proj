[Verse 1]
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
It lingered until my dreams came true
[Verse 2]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
[Verse 3]
Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
[Verse 2]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
[Verse 3]
Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
