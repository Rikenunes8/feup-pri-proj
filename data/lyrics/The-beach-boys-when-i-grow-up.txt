When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(14, 15)
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?
(16, 17)
Well, I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
(18, 19)
When they're out having fun, yeah, will I still wanna have my share?
(20, 21)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
(22, 23)
Won't last forever
(24, 25)
It's kind of sad
(26, 27)
Won't last forever
(28, 29)
It's kind of sad
(30, 31)
Won't last forever
