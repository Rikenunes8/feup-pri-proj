It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
'Cause it's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's a-drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister's looking cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair-ah
So, don't give us none of your aggravation
I've had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Try-a set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
We're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly to see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
And drink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"
The only two sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
So, don't give us none of your aggravation
I've had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Try-a set the dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
I had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action inGet about as oiled as a diesel train
Try to set the dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
Oh Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
