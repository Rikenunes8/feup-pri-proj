[Chorus]
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
[Verse 1]
Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do
[Chorus]
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
[Verse 2]
Movies only make me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
'Cause I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do
[Bridge]
Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away
[Chorus]
Well I don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
[Verse 1]
Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do
[Bridge]
Like a summer rose
To sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away[Chorus - Outro]
I just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
