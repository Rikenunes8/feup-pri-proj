You're taking what you want right from me
Wrapped up in so much
Life is just the way you hold me
You pick your miscellaneously
Wrapped up in all the choices you're not giving to me

I'm laying on the floor
We're drinking 'cause we're bored
Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places
And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces
(One more time)
Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places
And we'll keep falling on each other to  fill the empty spaces

You're saying what you want right to me
No filter on your mouth, we know you talk in your sleep
Remembering the times they won't remember me
Our nights melt into sequels, you sink into me

I'm laying on the floor
We're drinking 'cause we're bored

Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places
And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces
(One more time)
Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places
And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces

Just a little bit of affection, a little bit
Just a little bit of affection, a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit of, oh
Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places
And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces
(One more time)
Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places
And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces
