[Chorus: Mike Love]
She knows me
She knows me
[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Sometimes I have a weird way of showing my love
And I always expect her to know what I'm thinking of
[Chorus: Mike Love]
She knows me
[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I treat her so mean I don't deserve what I have
And I think that she'll forget just by making her laugh
But she knows me
[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
[Verse 3: Brian Wilson]
I get so jealous of the other guy
And then I'm not happy til' I make her break down and cry
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
But she knows me
[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
[Instrumental - Carl's Solo]
[Chorus: Mike Love]
She knows me
She knows me[Verse 4: Brian Wilson]
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
'Cause she knows me
[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
