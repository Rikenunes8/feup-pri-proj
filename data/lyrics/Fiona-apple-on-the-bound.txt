[Verse 1]
All my life is on me now
Hail the pages turning
And the future's on the bound
Hell don't know my fury
[Chorus]
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, and maybe some faith would do me good
[Verse 2]
I don't know what I'm doing, don't know, should I change my mind?
I can't decide, there's too many variations to consider
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself, I make it bitter
[Verse 3]
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time
Tell me you belong to me
Baby, say that it's all gonna be alright
I believe that it isn't
[Chorus]
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, and maybe some faith would do me good
