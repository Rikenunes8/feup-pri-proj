[Verse 1]
The stars in your eyes set my soul on fire
Your voice is like an angel above me
The touch of your hand drives me insane
But baby, I wants to be loved
[Verse 2]
I'm crazy about every little thing you do
I cherish the way you hug me
Your kiss is so sweet, honey, it can't be beat
But baby, I wants to be loved
[Bridge]
Every time I ask you for a date
You don't come at all or mighty late
I ask you to dance, take a little spin
You say, wait a minute, daddy, here come my friend
[Verse 3]
I love the way you walk when you pass me by
And even when you try to snub me
You kiss me, baby, when you give me the eye
But baby, I wants to be loved
Alright!
[Harmonica Solo]
[Bridge]
Yeah every time I ask you for a date
You don't come at all or mighty late
I ask you to dance, take a little spin
You say, wait a minute, daddy, here come my friend
[Verse 3]
I love the way you walk when you pass me by
And even when you try to snub me
You kiss me, honey, when you give me the eye
But baby, I wants to be loved
