[Verse 1]
Just a quiet city sport
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade
[Chorus 1]
He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee
[Bridge]
Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road
He's a tin soldier man
[Chorus 2]
Wickie wa-waddle doo
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy
He's a tin soldier man
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Outro]
He's a tin soldier man
He's a tin soldier man
