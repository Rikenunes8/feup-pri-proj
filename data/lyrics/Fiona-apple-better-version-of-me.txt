[Verse 1]
The nickel dropped
 
when I was on
My way beyond the rubicon
What did I do?
And of the games that I can handle
None are ones worth the candle
What should I do?
I'm a frightened, fickle person
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'
What should I do?
[Chorus]
Oooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What will I do?
[Verse 2]
Can't take a good day without a bad one
Don't feel just to smile until I've had one
Where did I learn?
I make a fuss about a little thing
The rhyme is losing to the riddling
Where's the turn?
I don't want a home, I'd ruin that
Home is where my habits have a habitat
Why give it a turn?
[Chorus]
Oooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What did I learn?
[Bridge]
I am likely to miss the main event
If I stop to cry or complain again
So I will keep a deliberate pace
Let the damned breeze dry my face[Breakdown]
Ooooh mister wait until you see
What I'm gonna be
[Verse 3]
I've got a plan, a demand and it just began
And if you're right, you'll agree
Here's coming a better version of me
[Outro]
Here it comes, a better version of me
Here it comes, a better version of me
