You're so sweet
You're so fine
I want you all and everything just to be mine
Cause you're my babe
Cause you're my love
Girl I'm just a Jeepster for your love
You slide so good
With bones so fair
You've got the universe reclining in your hair
Cause you're my babe
Yes you're my love
Oh, girl I'm just a Jeepster for your love
Just like a car
You're pleasing to behold
I'll call you Jaguar if I may be so bold
Cause you're my babe
Yes you're my love
Oh, girl I'm just a Jeepster for your love
The wild winds blow
Upon your frozen cheeks
The way you flip your hip it always makes me weak
Cause you're my babe
Cause you're my love
Girl I'm just a Jeepster for your love
Your motivation
Is so sweet
Your vibrations are burning up my feet
Cause you're my babe
Cause you're my love
Girl I'm just a Jeepster for your love
I said, girl I'm just a vampire for your love
And I'm going to suck you
