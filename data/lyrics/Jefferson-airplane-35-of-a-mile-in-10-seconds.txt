Do away with people blowing my mind
Do away with people wasting my precious time
Take me to a simple place
Where I can easily see my face
Maybe baby, I'll say that you were kind

Know I love you baby, yes I do
Know I love you baby, yes I do
Do away with people laughing at my hair
Do away with people frowning on my precious prayers
Take me to a circus tent
Where I can easily pay my rent
And all the other freaks will share my cares

Know I love you baby, yes I do
Know I love you baby, yes I do

Do away with things that come on obscene
Like high-priced, pretty clean, real fine nicotine
Sometimes the price is sixty-five dollars
Prices like that make a grown man holler
'Specially when it's sold by a kid who's only fifteen

Know I love you baby, yes I do
Know I love you baby, yes I do

Three fifths of a mile in ten seconds!
