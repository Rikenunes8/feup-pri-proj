[Verse 1]
Time to live
Time to lie
Time to laugh
Time to die
[Chorus]
Take it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh, you've been moving much too fast
[Verse 2]
Time to walk
Time to run
Time to aim your arrows
At the sun
[Chorus]
Takes it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh, you've been moving much too fast
[Verse 3]
Go real slow
You like it more and more
Take it as it comes
Specialize in having fun
[Chorus]
Takes it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh, you've been moving much too fast[Outro]
Moving much too fast
Moving much too fast
