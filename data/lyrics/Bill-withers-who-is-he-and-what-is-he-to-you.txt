[Verse 1]
A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you, you looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dad-gum-it! 
Who is he, and what is he to you?
[Verse 2]
Ah, something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
Ahh, and when you cleared your throat, was that your cue?
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?
[Verse 3]
Ah now, when I add the sum of you and me
I get confused and keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man but not enough for two
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?
[Verse 4]
Well, you tell me men don’t have much intuition, no no
Is that what you really think, little girl, or are you wishin’?
Before you wreck your old home, be certain of the new
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?
[Outro]
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?
