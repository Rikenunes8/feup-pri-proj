M'lady
M'lady
M'lady
[Verse 1]
A smile of pleasure
Beautiful and kind
A pretty face, a pretty face
Oh, what a gorgeous mind
[Verse 2]
She's a winner, hey
Give her some attention
Just thought I'd mention that
[Bridge]
Give her some time (Time, time)
Give her some time (Time, time)
Give her some time (Time, time)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
M'lady
M'lady
M'lady
M'lady
[Interlude]
Boo-boo-boo-nigh-ah
Boo-boo-boo-nah
Boo-boo-boo-nigh-ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
M'lady
