You thought that I was on your side
And I'd do anything for you
But you found out yesterday
That you were wrong
I opened up the door
I said we were through
And now you're calling me
You want me back again
But I've just got to turn my head
And start to pretend
I've never seen you
You're someone I don't know
Are you just another boy
That I met long ago?
You had me all to yourself
I thought that you were such a prize
I finally came to my senses
When I heard just one too many lies
And now you're calling me
You want me back again
But I've just got to turn my head
And start to pretend
I've never seen you
You're someone I don't know
Are you just another boy
That I met long ago?
You can talk about old times (yesterday is gone)
They don't mean a thing to me
You're fading fast
Out of my memory
And now you're calling me
You want me back again
But I've just got to turn my head
And start to pretend
I've never seen you
You're someone I don't know
Are you just another boy
That I met long ago?You can talk about old times (yesterday is gone)
They don't mean a thing to me
You're fading fast
Out of my memory
You can talk about old times (yesterday is gone)
They don't mean a thing to me
You're fading fast
Out of my memory
You're fading fast
Out of my memory
