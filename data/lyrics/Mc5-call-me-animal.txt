[Verse 1]
I take a laser beam
And I use it like a stone axe, baby
I take the present, past and future, mama
And blast it out my thorax
[Chorus]
Call me animal, that's my name
Call me animal, I'm not ashamed
Call me animal, this is your hour
Call me animal, you've got the power
[Verse 2]
I use the juju of my ancestors
To drive this piece of meat
I scream the music of the Pleistocene
Just because it's got a good beat
[Chorus]
Call me animal, that's my name
Call me animal, I'm not ashamed
Call me animal, this is your hour
Call me animal, you've got the power
Animal
Animal
Animal
Animal
[Chorus]
Call me animal, that's my name
Call me animal, I'm not ashamed
Call me animal, this is your hour
Call me animal, you've got the power
Animal
Animal
Animal
Animal
