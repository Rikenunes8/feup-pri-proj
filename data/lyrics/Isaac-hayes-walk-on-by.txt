If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Oh just let me grieve
In private cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
Oh baby, walk on by
Mmm
I just can't get over losing you
So if I seem broken in two
Please walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
I didn't ask for it but you gave me
When you said goodbye
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
So do me a favor and walk on by
Please, oh, walk on by
I just can't get over losing you
So if I seem broken in two
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
You put the hurt on me
You socked it to me, mama
When you said goodbye
So please walk on by
Oh, mama, make believe you never see the tears I cry
So do me a favor and walk on by
So I'm beggin' you to walk on byOh yeah
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
So I'm beggin' you, I'm beggin' you to walk on by
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
Oh, there's no dust in my eye
Oh no
Smoke ain't making me cry, nah nah nah
It's the hurt you put on me, yeah
I don't want you to see this man cry
So please walk on by
Oh mama, mama, walk on by
