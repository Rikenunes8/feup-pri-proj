[Verse 1]
Oh see the boys out walking
The boys, they look so fine
Dressed up in green velvet
Their silver buckles shine
Soon they'll be bleary eyed
Under a keg of wine
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll
[Verse 2]
Oh see that lover standing
Staring at the ground
He went looking for the real thing
And lies were all he found
You can get the real thing
It will only cost a pound
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll
[Verse 3]
There goes a troubled woman
She dreams a troubled dream
She lives out on the highway
And she keeps her money clean
Soon she'll be returning
To the place where she's the queen
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll
[Verse 4]
Now you can be a gambler
That never drew a hand
And you can be a sailor
Who never left dry land
And you can be Jesus
And everyone will understand
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll
