[Verse 1]
Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real, so right
Ages ago last night
[Verse 2]
Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that seems so bright?
Ages ago last night
[Bridge]
To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak
[Verse 3]
So now let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night
