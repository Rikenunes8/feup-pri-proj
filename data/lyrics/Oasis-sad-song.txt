[Verse 1]
Sing a sad song in a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long since I found this space
You better put in two or three
We as people are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see, well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel
[Chorus]
Where we're living in this town
The Sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day
[Verse 2]
If you're needing something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If you're honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song in a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
[Chorus]
Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
When we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
