[Verse 1: Black Francis]
There was a god
An under water god who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge
From New York and New Jersey
[Chorus: Kim Deal, 
Kim Deal and Black Francis
]
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
[Verse 2: Black Francis]
The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole
Now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
And if the ground's not cold, 
everything is gonna burn
We'll all take turns, I'll get mine too
[Chorus: Kim Deal, 
Kim Deal and Black Francis
]
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
[Bridge: Black Francis]
Rock me, Joe
[Verse 3: Black Francis]
If Man is five, if Man is five
If Man is five, then the Devil is six
Then the Devil is six, then the Devil is six
The Devil is six, and if the Devil is six
Then God is seven, then God is seven
Then God is seven
[Chorus: Kim Deal, 
Kim Deal and Black Francis
]
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This mon
key's gone to Heaven
