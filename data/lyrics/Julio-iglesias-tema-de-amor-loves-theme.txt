Play our love's theme tonight
My love's here, it's no dream tonight
It's been oh so long
Since we've danced to our love song
And I just know the melody that made her mine
Will be the melody that keeps her close to me, so..
Play our love's theme once more
Make her feel what she felt before
While the lights are low
Just let the music flow
And I just know that the melody that made her mine
Will be the melody that keeps her close to me
Love's theme
Let it play
Let it play
Let it play
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Come on and play our love's theme again
Touch her heart, touch her soul and then
Once we sip the wine
Her lips will welcome mine
And I just know that the melody that made her mine
Will be the melody that keeps her close to me
