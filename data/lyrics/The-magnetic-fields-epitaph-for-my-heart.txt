Let this be the epitaph for my heart
Cupid put too much poison in the dart
This is the epitaph for my heart
Because it's gone, gone, gone
And life goes on and on anon
And death goes on, world without end
And you're not my friend
Who will mourn the passing of my heart?
Will its little droppings climb the pop chart?
Who'll take its ashes and singing, fling
Them from the top of the Brill Building?
And life goes on and dawn, and dawn
And death goes on, world without end
And you're not my friend
