[Verse]
I'm going out walking
Walking down through the park
I'm going to walk in the moonlight
Until the night gets dark
I'm going out walking
Along the old avenue
I'm going to walk for so long
Until she won't know what to do
I'm going out walking
Walking down along the street
I'm going to walk her along beside me
That girl can't be beat
Don't you bother my baby
No telling what she'll do
The girl she may cut you
She may shoot you too
