[Verse 1: T-Boz]
You sweet young thang you
Whatever you do Lord knows you do it nice and easy
You keep it nice and long
You sexy thang you
Whatever it is you want from me you know I'll satisfy
Just keep the love at home
[Pre-Chorus 1: Chilli (T-Boz)]
You give me pleasure (Give me pleasure, yeah)
Unlike any pleasure that I've felt or ever seen
I can't get enough of you in me
You know I treasure
Each and every waking moment that you spend with me
I'm in ecstasy
[Chorus]
Let's do it again
Cause I love to make sweet love to you baby
Let's do it again
I wanna go all night long
Let's do it again
Cause I love to make sweet love to you baby
Let's do it again
I wanna go all night long
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
You precious thang you
I love what you do when you do
And you do it oh so special
I don't see nothin' wrong
With nothin' 'bout you
Whatever it is that makes you feel so very special
A baby please please keep it on
[Pre-Chorus 2: Chilli]
I so desire
Everything about you and I want you close to me
As close as close could ever be
Come and light the fire
That waits for you and yearns for you that burns inside of me
Take me to ecstasy[Chorus]
Let's do it again
Cause I love to make sweet love to you baby
Let's do it again
I wanna go all night long
Let's do it again
Cause I love to make sweet love to you baby
Let's do it again
I wanna go all night long
