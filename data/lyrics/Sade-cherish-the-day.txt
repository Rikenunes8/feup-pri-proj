[Verse 1]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven
[Chorus]
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air
You show me how deep love can be
[Verse 2]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
[Chorus]
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away[Bridge]
You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer
[Chorus]
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
I Cherish the Day
