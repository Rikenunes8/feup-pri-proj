The reason why oh, I can say
I have to let you go, baby and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel
A whole lot better when you're gone
Baby, for a long time you had me believe
That your love was all mine
And that's the way it would be
But I didn't know that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel
A whole lot better when you're gone, oh when you're gone
Now, I've got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games any more
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel
A whole lot better when you're gone oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone, oh when you're gone
