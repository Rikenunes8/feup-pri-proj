[Verse 1]
(Hear me, Lord)
Forgive me, Lord
Please, those years when I ignored you, hmm
Forgive them, Lord
Those that feel they can't afford you, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To rise above this dealing, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To love you with more feeling, hmm

At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that you're not in
Oh, won't you hear me, Lord?
