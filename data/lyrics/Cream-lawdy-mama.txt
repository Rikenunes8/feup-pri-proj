Wanna go out, baby, too late at night
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Wanna go out, baby, too late at night
I got a real funny feelin'
You're gonna treat your daddy right
Long-legged woman, come and hold my hand
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Long-legged woman, come and hold my hand
I got a real funny feelin'
You wanna love another man
(Guitar Solo)
Leavin' in the mornin', your cryin' won't make me stay
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Leavin' in the mornin' baby, your cryin' won't make me stay
The more you cry baby, further gonna drive your daddy away
Leavin' in the mornin', your cryin' won't make me stay
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Leavin' in the mornin' baby, your cryin' won't make me stay
The more you cry baby, further gonna drive your daddy away
