[Verse 1]
I remember
Ooh, how the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else
[Chorus]
Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
Just waiting
[Verse 2]
I spoke
To a man down at the tracks
And I ask him
How he don't go mad
He said "Look here, Junior
Don't you be so happy
And for Heaven's sake
Don't you be so sad"
[Chorus]
Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
Hesitating
[Verse 3]
Well, the Cadillac
It pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me
All they said, "Get in"
"Get in"
Then the Cadillac
It puttered back into the graveyard
Me
I got out again[Chorus]
Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Over there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
I ain't waitin', uh uh
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
I remember
How the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else
