[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (
With suspicious minds
)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
[Verse 2]
So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again, asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin' (
Yes, I'm cryin'
)
[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (
With suspicious minds
)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
[Bridge]
Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
[Outro]
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
