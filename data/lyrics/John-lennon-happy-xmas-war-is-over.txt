[Intro: Yoko Ono & 
John Lennon
]
Happy Christmas, Kyoko
Happy Christmas, Julian
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
So this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you had fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young
[Chorus: Yoko Ono & Harlem Community Choir]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
[Verse 2: John Lennon & 
Harlem Community Choir
]
And so this is Christmas
 
(
War is over
)
For weak and for strong
 
(
If you want it
)
The rich and the poor ones (
War is over
)
The road is so long (
Now
)
And so happy Christmas (
War is over
)
For black and for white (
If you want it
)
For yellow and red ones (
War is over
)
Let's stop all the fight (
Now
)
[Chorus: Yoko Ono & Harlem Community Choir]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
[Verse 3: John Lennon & 
Harlem Community Choir
]
And so this is Christmas (
War is over
)
And what have we done? (
If you want it
)
Another year over (
War is over
)
And a new one just begun (
Now
)
And so happy Christmas (
War is over
)
We hope you have fun (
If you want it
)
The near and the dear ones (
War is over
)
The old and the young (
Now
)[Chorus: Yoko Ono & Harlem Community Choir]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
[Outro: Yoko Ono & Harlem Community Choir]
War is over, if you want it
War is over, now
Happy Christmas
Happy Christmas (Happy Christmas)
