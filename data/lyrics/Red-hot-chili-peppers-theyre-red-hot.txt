Yes she got 'em for sale, yeah
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale (They too hot, boy)
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale
[Verse 2]
You know the monkey, now the baboon's playing in the grass
Well, the monkey stuck his finger in that old "Good Gulf Gas," now
[Chorus]
Hot tamales because they're red hot, yes, they got them for sale, I mean
Yes, she got them for sale, yeah
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale

She got two for a nickel, got four for a dime
Would sell you more, but they aren't mine

Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes, she got 'em for sale, yes, yeah
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale

Hot tamales because they're red hot, yes, they got them for sale, I mean
Yes, she got them for sale, yeah
