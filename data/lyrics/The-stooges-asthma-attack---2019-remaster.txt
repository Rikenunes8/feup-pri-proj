I am the physical embodiment of
Everything I never wanted to be
People must think this kid's fucking crazy
I am the prime example of indecision
Life hit me like a head on collision
But what am I supposed to do
When I'm so see-through?
I had never thought that life would
Would be like this
And now I'm thinking that maybe I should (maybe I should)
Maybe give life a miss
And if living was the equivalent of breathing
Then maybe I should (maybe I should)
Prepare myself for a
Another asthma attack
Don't ask me all these bloody questions, I'll get arsey
You think I know myself, well you'd be mostly wrong
It's taken way too long for me to sing my song
Old me is dead and gone
If lying was a crime, then I'd be doing time
I don't mean to whine, but just imagine having to lie to
Friends, foes, all of those people that should matter most
Living a double life is just as obvious as Pinocchio
I had never thought that life would
Would be like this
And now I'm thinking that maybe I should (maybe I should)
Maybe give life a miss
And if living was the equivalent of breathing
Then maybe I should (maybe I should)
Prepare myself for a
Another asthma attack
I had never thought that life would (never thought that life would)
Would be like this
And now I'm thinking that maybe I should (maybe I should)
