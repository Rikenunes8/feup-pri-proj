[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, and dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the mornin’
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out
[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale
[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
[Chorus]
Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home
Go home
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Ooh, pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Oh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman
Woman
Yeah
Oh, ah[Audience]
Yeah
