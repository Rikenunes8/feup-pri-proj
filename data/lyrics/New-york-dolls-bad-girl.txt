Bad girl
A new bad girl, who get on my block
I gave her my keys, said don't bother to knock
I said, c'mon, y'got what I need
I said, come on, don't make my heart bleed
(I'm beggin')
Whoah bad girl, whatcha tryin' to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl, what are you tryin' to do
'Cause I'm early in the morning, not too late at night
And you're tryin to tell me everything's alright
Then you're gonna ask am I gonna take it slow
I said, don't you worry, there's no place I gotta go
(My bad girl)
I'm walkin' to the corner, to go in the cafe
That's when I seen her, a-walkin' my way
She's all dolled up in her waitress' skirt
I said, c'mon, don't make my heart hurt
(I'm beggin')
Whoah bad girl, whatcha tryin' to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl, what are you tryin' to doWith my twenty dollar bills and you can keep the change
All you gotta do is get down in my range
If you're gonna ask me am I gonna take it slow
I said, don't you worry, there's no place I gotta go
(You're bad, bad, so bad)
(I'm beggin')
