[Verse 1]
Blue suns and grey lagoons
Silver starfish with honeymoons
All these and more to choose
If you
[Verse 2]
Satin teardrops on velvet lights
Morning sickness on Friday nights
Heaven knows what others I might bring
To you
[Verse 3]
Broken partings making strange goodbyes
Hopeless cases with fake alibis
Even hoping we'll be there to share
With you
[Verse 3]
Broken partings making strange goodbyes
Hopeless cases with fake alibis
Even hoping we'll be there to share
With you
[Outro]
Blue suns and grey lagoons
Grey lagoons
Grey lagoon
