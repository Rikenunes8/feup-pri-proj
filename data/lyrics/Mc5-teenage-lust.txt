Back in Lincoln Park where I was mostly raised
Hanging around town where I got totally crazed
Surrounded by bitches who wouldn't give it in
Who thought that getting down was an unnatural sin
I'd whisper "Baby baby help me, you really must
I need a healthy outlet
For my teenage lust"
So I moved into the city to improve my chances
I chased them at the bars and I grabbed them at the dances
They'd huggy snuggle kissy but they'd never go all the way
They'd cringe like in terror when they hear me say
"Baby baby help, you really really must
I need a healthy outlet
For my teenage lust!"
Yes I do now baby, my teenage won't make
Away much longer
I really need release
It means so much to me
How can a young Midwestern boy
Live in such misery?
Then one day I had the perfect plan
I shake my ass and scream "Get a rock'n'roll band!"
From now on there'll be no compromising
Rock'n'roll music is the best advertising
"Baby I can help, you know I got the guts
I'll be the healthy outlet
For your teenage lust!"
Come on darling come on baby
This teenage lust is driving me crazy
I gotta have it baby, I can't do without
When I got the feeling I got to work it out
I ain't got no time, for messing around
So come on bitch you've got to get down
Come on darling come on baby
This teenage lust is driving me crazy
