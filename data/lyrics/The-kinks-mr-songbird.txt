[Verse 1]
Won't you sing me a song or two?
Won't take you long to do
Sing to me please
Won't you whistle a tune?
I got nothing to gain, I got nothing to lose
But if you sing me a song
You'll make me happy
[Chorus]
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
You help to keep my troubles away
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
You help to keep my troubles away
[Bridge]
Mister, won't you sing me a song?
Won't you sing a little melody?
Won't you try to help me along?
Won't you sing a little song for me, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
Sing me a song or two
Won't take you long to do
Sing to me please
Won't you whistle a tune?
Though I ain't got a beanie
'Cause I've nothing to dream
So if you waiting for nothing
Do something for me
[Chorus]
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
You help to keep my troubles away
[Outro]
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
Sing Mr. Songbird
You help to keep my troubles away
You help to keep my problems away
You help to keep the devil away
