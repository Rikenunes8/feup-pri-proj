[Verse]
Ah, I'm a mean, mean woman
And I don't mean no one man, no good, no
I'm a mean, mean woman
I don't mean no one man, no good
I just treats them like I wants to
I never treats them, honey like I should
Oh, Lord, I once had a daddy
He said he'd give me everything in sight
Once had a daddy
Said he'd give me everything in sight
Yes, he did
So I said, "Honey, I want the sunshine
You take the stars out of the night
Come on and give them to me, babe, because I want them right now"
I'm not the kind of woman
Who'd make your life a bed of ease, ha ha ha ha!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not the kind of woman, no
To make your life a bed of ease
Yeah, but if you, if you just want to go out drinking, honey
Won't you invite me along please
Oh, I'll be so good to you babe, yeah
Whoa, go on
I guess I'm just like a turtle
That's hiding underneath its hardened shell
Whoa, whoa, oh yeah, like a turtle
Hiding underneath its hardened shell
But you know I'm very well protected
I know this goddamn life too well
Oh! Now call me mean, you can call me evil, yeah, yeah
I've been called much of some things around
Honey, don't you know I have
Whoa, call me mean or call me evil
I've been called much of some things, all things around
Yeah, but I'm going to take good care of Janis, yeah
Honey, no one's going to dog me down
Alright, yeah
