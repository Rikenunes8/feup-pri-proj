No weak men in the books at home
The strong men who have made the world
History lives on the books at home
The books at home
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
The past lives on in your front room
The poor still weak, the rich still rule
History lives in the books at home
The books at home
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
The past lives in the books at home
No weak men in the books at home
History lives in the books at home
The books at home
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
