[Verse 1]
He bought a sterilized hypo
To shoot a sex machine drug
He got twenty-four hours
To shoot all Paulenes between the legs
Ninety-six tears
 through twenty-four hours
Sexed once every hour
[Chorus]
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
[Verse 2]
L.A. bus doors open
Kicking both doors open
When it rested on 6th Street
That's when he drug a girl inside
He was spreading her legs
And didn't understand dying
She was still awake
[Chorus]
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
When he was waking up
Beside the bed
He found clumps of hair
The last Paulene wouldn't cooperate
She wasn't what you call living, really
She was still awake
[Chorus]
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
