One, two, three, four
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cry
I never miss you, no, I never miss you
Except when I'm awake
And I don't need you, no, I don't need you
Except when my heart breaks
I'm getting used to being alone
In this empty house, that's not a home
And tell myself it's over, now put you on a shelf
And tell myself I'm happy and I also tell myself
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cry
In every room I found, something you left behind
Come get 'em, they're all yours
I haven't changed the locks, you don't have to knock
Your key fits every door
It doesn't mean that I want you back
I'll find someone else and that's a fact
I'm better off without you, that's what I say all day
I say, I'm glad you left me and I also say
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cry
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cryI'm getting used to being alone
In this empty house, that's not a home
I tell myself it's over and I put you on a shelf
I tell myself I'm happy and I also tell myself
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cry
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water it runs dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cry
