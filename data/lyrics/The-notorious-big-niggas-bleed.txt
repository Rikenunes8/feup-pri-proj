[Verse 1]
"Today's agenda (Woo!), got the suitcase up in the Sentra (Ugh)
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest if no money exchanges (Uh-huh)
I got these kids in Ranges to leave them niggas brainless (Ugh)
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible
, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes like 
True Lies
, kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream, or else (Ugh)
Your life is on the shelf, we mean this, Frank
Them cats we fucking with put bombs in your mom's gas tank"
"Let's get this money baby (Ugh), they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty .380s (Ugh, ugh)
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out
Clear the mall out, fuck the fallout
Word to Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me (Ugh)
Fucking real, here's the deal (Ugh)
I got a hundred bricks, 14.5 apiece (Uh-huh)
Enough to cop a 6, buy the house on the beach
 (Uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capisce?
Everybody getting cream, no one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1.5
I kill 'em all, I'll be set for life"—"Frank, pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen (Ugh), renegades
If you die, they still get paid, extra probably; fuck a robbery
I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em"—"I promise"
But, of course, you know I had my fingers crossed[Chorus]
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 
Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands while he just deciding
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all; running ain't in my protocol (Ugh!)
[Verse 2]
Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley (Uh-huh)
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely (Ugh)
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a jux
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made 
America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now, he feel he undefeated, he mean it
"Nothing to lose" tattooed around his gun wounds
"Everything to gain" embedded in his brain
And me? I feel the same—for this money, you dying
Especially if my daughter crying, I ain't lying
Y'all know the science[Chorus]
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 
Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands while he just deciding
(Niggas bleed just like us)
 I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all; running ain't in my protocol (Ugh)
[Verse 3]
We agreed—to go in shooting is silly
Because niggas could be hiding in showers with MAC-millis
So I freaked 'em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican (Ugh)
Gloria from Astoria, I went to war with her peeps in '91
Stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place; long story, Glo' seen't my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was coming for the safe (Haha!)
Now she breaking, "Shut up! 112, what's shaking?"
"A Jamaican, some bitches, I swear they look gay
And a black Range Rover been outside all day"
If it's trouble, let me know, I'll be on my way
"Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed"
Nightmare, this bitch don't need
"Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we about to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice"
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
"Ron, pass the gasoline," the nigga passed me kerosene (Ugh)
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds, and here come two...
Opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway, waiting patient
As soon as she hit the door, we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast (Ugh)
She crying, headshots put her to rest
Pop open them briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot: sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol-gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement (Uh-huh)
They Range got towed, they double-parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers (Hahahahahaha!)
