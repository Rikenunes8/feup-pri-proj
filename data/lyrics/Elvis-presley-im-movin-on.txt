[Verse 1]
That big eight-wheeler runnin' down the track
Mean your true lovin' Daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause he's Moving on, he's rolling on
You were flying' too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving' on
[Verse 2]
But some day, baby, when you've had your play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep moving on, keep rolling on
You were flying too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving on, move on, baby
[Verse 3]
Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me?
'Cause I gotta pretty momma in Tennessee
To keep rolling on, keep moving on
Please listen to me, let this rattler free
Keep moving on, move on, son, move on
[Verse 4]
Well, I told you, baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
And now I'm moving on, I'm rolling on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
But I'm moving on, move on, baby, move on[Bridge]
