[Verse 1:]
How do you do, Lucy?
You sure been hard to find
I heard you had a daughter
Six years old and
I just can't keep from cry'n'
Six years Lucy, Lord have mercy
That's a long time, that's a long time
[Verse 2:]
Is she pretty, has she grown?
Does she sleep well in a room of her own?
Can I see her?
Does she know that I'm her daddy, I'm her daddy?
[Verse 3:]
Did you give her one of my pictures?
Does she carry-yeh, a picture with her?
Does she show it to the baby sitter, and say
"See that man, that's my daddy, that's my daddy?"
[Outro:]
You should 'a told me, Lucy,
 
You should 'a told me, Lucy
Yeh, you should 'a told me, Lucy...
Oh, Lucy. Oh, Lucy. Oh, Lucy. Oh, Lucy
You should 'a told me Lucy
