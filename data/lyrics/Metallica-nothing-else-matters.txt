[Guitar Intro]
[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
[Refrain]
And nothing else matters
[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
[Refrain]
And nothing else matters
[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
[Refrain]
And nothing else matters
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
[Refrain]
And nothing else matters
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
[Refrain]
And nothing else matters
[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
[Refrain]
And nothing else matters
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah![Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
[Refrain]
No, nothing else matters
