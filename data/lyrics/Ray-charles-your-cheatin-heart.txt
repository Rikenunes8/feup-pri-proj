Your cheating heart
Will make you weep
You'll cry and cry
And try to sleep
But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheating heart
Will tell on you

When tears come down (Tears come down)
Like falling rain (Falling rain)
You'll toss around (Toss around)
And call my name (Call my name)
You'll walk the floor
The way I do
Your cheating heart
Will tell on you (Will tell on you)

When tears come down (When tears come down)
Like falling rain (Like falling rain)
You'll toss around (You'll toss around)
And call my name (And call my name)
You'll walk the floor
The way I do
Your cheating heart
Will tell on you
(Your cheating heart)
