Horses

The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea (A glass of tea)
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
(His gold nerves merged perfectly with the hallway)
He merged perfectly with the hallway
(A radiant light, an aura around the mirror merged and looked at Johnny)
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
(Fastened, in the kitchen)
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run
But the movie kept moving as planned
(Johnny wanted to run but the movie kept moving as planned)
The boy took Johnny (The boy took Johnny), he pushed him against the locker (He pushed him against the locker)
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny (He drove it in, he drove it home)
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees
Started crashing his head against the locker
Started crashing his head against the locker
Started laughing hysterically
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining silver studs with their nose in flames
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses
Land of A Thousand Dances

Do you know how to pony like Bony Maroney?
Do you know how to twist? Well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato
Do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, I dig your baby sister
And rise up on her knees
Do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee-pee
Roll down on her back
Got to lose control, got to lose control
Got to lose control and then you take control
Then you're rolled down on your back
And you like it like that, like it like that, like it like that, like it like that
And then you do the Watusi, yeah do the Watusi

Life is filled with holes
Johnny's laying there in his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, "Oh, pretty boy can't you show me nothing but surrender?"
And Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket
Taped to his chest there's the answer
You got pen knives and jack knives and switchblades preferred
Switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
"Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain"
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud and go, Johnny, go
And do the Watusi, oh do the Watusi
There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks
Across the tracks, and the name of the place is
You like it like that, you like it like that
You like it like that, you like it like that
And the name of the band is
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down
On the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair
And I don't waste time, I just walk right up
And saw that up there, there is a sea (He's always staring)
Up there there is a sea, up there, there is a sea (A sea)
The sea's the possibility (And in to time, he walked right up)
There is no land but the land (Up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea (Up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key (Up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities (Up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me (There is a sea, there is a sea of possibilities)
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(In a sea of possibilities, up there, there is a) I felt his hand on my knee
(On the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of coral flame
(In the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(The spoon) And let it dip in
(The veins) Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
(It started hardening) Dip in to the sea
(It started hardening in my hand) To the sea of possibilities
(And I felt the arrows of desire, that)
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a Brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the Watusi
Yeah do the Watusi, do the Watusi
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall, yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined in your silky hair
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers (I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body (I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it)
Iâ€”I that's how I, that's how I, I died
(At that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after) (They knew what they were after)
 moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility (No possibility, no possibility, no possibility)
(The possibilities) Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land
La Mer De

Looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
That went streaming through the sands like fingers
Like arteries, like fingers
(How much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (Your eyes)
He opened his throat (Your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (Of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (And my heart) was so high (My heart) pitched that nobody heard
No one heard that cry
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat
(His fingers) Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly
(Throat) And so he seized the first (His vocal chords shot up)
The closest possibility (Mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate (There is nothin' happening at all)
And go inside the black tube (so when he looked out into the step)
(Saw this sweet young thing) Fender one
(Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter)
In the sheets, there was a man
Dancing around to the simple
Rock and roll song
