[Verse 1]
Oh, Daddy, you know you make me cry
How can you love me, I don't understand why
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
[Chorus]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong? (So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong? (So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried
[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
