[Verse 1]
Two-headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun, it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
And I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are
[Verse 2]
Two-headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
[Chorus]
We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers
Through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving, now
They just lay there in their climb
[Verse 3]
Two-headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
[Chorus]
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving, now
They just lay there in their climb[Verse 4]
Two-headed boy
There's no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go
