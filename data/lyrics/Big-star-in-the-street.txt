[Verse 1]
Hanging out, down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Not a thing to do, but talk to you
[Verse 2]
Steal your car, and bring it down
Pick me up, we'll drive around
Wish we had a joint so bad
[Bridge]
Bust a street light
Out past midnight
[Verse 3]
Hanging out, down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Not a thing to do, but talk to you
