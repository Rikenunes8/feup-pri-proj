[Verse 1]
Bag lady, you gone hurt your back
Draggin' all them bags like that
I guess nobody ever told you
All you must hold onto
Is you, is you, is you
[Pre-Chorus]
One day, all them bags gon' get in your way
One day, all them bags gon' get in your way
I said one day, all them bags gon' get in your way
One day, all them bags gon' get in your way
[Chorus]
So, pack light, pack light
Pack light, pack light
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Bag lady, you gon' miss your bus
You can't hurry up 'cause you got too much stuff
When they see you coming, niggas take off running
From you, it's true, oh, yes, they do
[Pre-Chorus]
One day, he gon' say, "You crowding my space"
One day, he gon' say, "You crowding my space"
I said one day, he gon' say, "You crowding my space"
One day, he gon' say, "You crowding my space"
[Chorus]
So, pack light, pack light
Pack light, pack light
Ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
Girl, I know sometimes it's hard
And we can't let go
Oh, when someone hurts you, oh so bad inside
You can't deny it, you can't stop crying
So, oh, oh, oh
If you start breathin', you won't believe it
You'll feel so much better, so much better, baby[Outro]
