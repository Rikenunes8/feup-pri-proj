[Intro]
Alright, hold on
[Verse 1]
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for seven dollars a hour
Call my mama like, "Mama
I ain't making minimum wage, mama
I'm on, mama, I'm on
Now  I'm making 400, 600, 800K, mama
To stand on my feet, mama
Play these songs, it's therapy, mama
They paying me, mama
I should be paying them"
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was, I don't know which heaven would have me, mama
Let me run this bitch, I'ma run it into the ground, mama, the whole galaxy
Goddamn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas and
Fuck me if I hated on you
[Verse 2]
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me, don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree throw a big shadow (Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company, please give me immortality (It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
 
(Keep me high, Castrati)
Damn (Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
 
(Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke somethin'
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la
La-la-la
[Verse 3]
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga, murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my photo
I only got one four-door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song, so I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas wan' fight in the streets
Now shit startin' to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog, this is chess now, not fetch, I ain't runnin' for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meets, that's the only time I ran from a nigga
You can change this track now, could've changed this bitch a long time ago
—know and —know, —know and —know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th, though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went one-eighty on me, please run that back, though[Skit]
You say some shit about me? Tuck a real sport, my nigga
That shit happened the second time? 'Cause Mark saw both times, nigga, I only saw the first time
That second time, Jerron was there, nigga
On God, he grabbed me in circles, nigga
And the, and the other nigga tried to pull me
Oh yeah, Jerron told me you that your ass especially told him
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga (The first time I saw?), I had this nigga like—

I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
[Mikey]
Yo, what, what's, what's the year 3000 going to look like? (Dog, stop, stop, what you mean, bro? Stop, stop)
[Na'kel]
Or it could be great and shit can fly
And buildings would be very, very tall and everybody won't know what the ground looks like
[Frank]
That's fucked up

Sometimes I'm very musty

[Sage]

Just sits inside his house

Super high and try to land in like a handstand or something
[Mikey]
Alright, that's it
[Ryan]
I don't know, there would be a lot of things I'll do
Probably spend a lot of time with my family
[Na’kel]
Spend a couple hours with my family and I would go out and do like everything that I ever thought about trying
[Ryan]
I don't know, there's a lot of things that you could do
That's it
[Mikey]
How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
(I'd say like a thousand years?)
