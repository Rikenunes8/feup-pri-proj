[Verse 1]
Why do men go crazy
When a woman wears her dress so tight?
Why do men go crazy
When a woman wears her dress so tight?
Well, it must be the same old thing
That makes a tomcat fight all night
Why do all of the men try to run
A big legged woman down?
Why do all of the men try to run
A big legged woman down?
Well, it must be the same old thing
That makes a bulldog love a hound
[Chorus]
Well, it's the same thing
Well, it's the same old thing
Better tell me who is to blame
Well, the whole world is a-fighting all about that same thing
[Verse 2]
What makes you feel so good
When your baby gets down her evening gown?
What makes you feel so good
When your baby gets down her evening gown?
Well, it must be the same old thing
That makes a preacher man lay his Bible down
[Chorus]
