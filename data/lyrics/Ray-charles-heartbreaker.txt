Heartbreaker, girl, you sure is gone
Heartbreaker, how you carry on
You're a bobbysoxer, mean mistreater too
You're a bobbysoxer, mean mistreater too
You just a little school girl, but you sure know what to do
Pretty baby in your new red dress
Pretty baby in your new red dress
When I'm not around you, I can't hardly get my rest
Heart-teaser, you're runnin' all around
Heart-teaser, girl, you're runnin' all around
And if you don't stop, baby, you'll be sleeping in the ground
How can I help it, baby, if I'm in love with you?
How can I help it if I'm in love with you?
I've been your fool, baby, tell me what more can I do
Heartbreaker, so you think you're smart

Well, heartbreaker, I want to tell you you broke my heart
You know you broke my heart
You said we'd never part
You know you broke my heart
You told me we would never part
Now you broke my heart
You know you broke my heart
