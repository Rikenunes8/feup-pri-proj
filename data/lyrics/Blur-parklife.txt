[Verse 1: Phil Daniels & 
Graham Coxon
]
Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as (
Parklife!
)
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as (
Parklife!
)
John's got brewer's droop, he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of it (
Parklife!
)
Who's that gut lord marching? You should cut down on your pork life mate, get some exercise
[Chorus: Damon Albarn & 
Phil Daniels
]
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
Know what I mean?
[Verse 2: Phil Daniels & 
Graham Coxon
]
I get up when I want, except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen (
Parklife!
)
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea
 and I think about leaving me house (
Parklife!
)
I feed the pigeons, I sometimes feed the sparrows too, it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (
Parklife!
)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it
[Chorus: Damon Albarn]
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
[Verse 3: Phil Daniels & 
Graham Coxon
]
Parklife (Parklife!)
Parklife (Parklife!)
It's got nothing to do with your Vorsprung durch Technik, you know
Parklife (Parklife!)
And it's not about you joggers who go 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Parklife (Parklife!)
[Chorus: Damon Albarn]
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
