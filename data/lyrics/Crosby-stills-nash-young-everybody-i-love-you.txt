Know you got to run, know you got to hide
Still there is a great life engrained deep within your eyes
Open up, open up, baby let me in
You expect for me to love you when you hate yourself my friend
La la la la
La la la la

Everybody I love you
Everybody I do (Oh yeah)
Though your heart is an answer (And I know it is)
I need your love to get through
(Oh yeah, I really do now)
When I tell you I love you (When I tell you)
You can believe that it's true (Oh yes it is)
Everybody I love you (Everybody is the same with you)
Everybody I do (Oh, yes I really do now)
