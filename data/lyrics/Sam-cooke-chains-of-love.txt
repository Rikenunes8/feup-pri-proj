Chains of love
Have tied my heart to you
Chains of love
Have made me feel so blue
Now that I'm your prisoner
Tell me what you're gonna do
What I wanna know is
Are you gonna leave me
Are you gonna make me cry
Tell me baby
Are you gonna leave me
Are you gonna make me cry
The chains are gonna haunt me
Until the day I die
Let me tell you right now
If you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free, pretty baby
If you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free
Cause I can't stand these chains around me
Unless you're here with me
In conclusion let me tell you honey
It's three o'clock in the morning
And oh, the moon is shining bright
One more time now
Three o'clock in the morning
The moon is shining bright
And O I just sit and wonder
Where can you be again tonight
