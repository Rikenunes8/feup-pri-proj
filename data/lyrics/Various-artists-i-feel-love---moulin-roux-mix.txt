All you need is love

You're being ridiculous

All you need is love
Just one night, give me just one night
There's no way 'cause you can't pay

In the name of love, one night in the name of love

You crazy fool, I won't give in to you

It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love

Love hurts

All you have to do is play the game

Love scars

All you have to do is
Take on me

No, no, no, it ain't me
Take me on

No, no, no because you'll be gone in a day or two

I love you, always, forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you

Love is a battlefield

Everything I will do for you

Don't speak
I know just what you're thinking
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl, you'll be my pride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love, but, a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart, when a heart can be broken?

You're breaking my heart
S'pose I never, ever met you

What's love got to do with it?

Suppose we never fell in love

Who needs a heart?

Suppose I kept on singing love songs

All of this music breaks my heart

Yes, it breaks my heart
Yes it breaks my heart

I can't help falling in love with you

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed lying naked on the floor

Take me on

Illusion never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

They will see us coming from such great heights
"Come down now", they'll say

Everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now", but we'll stay

'Cause, love lifts us up where we belong
Where the eagles fly on a mountain high

Love makes us act like we are fools
Throw our lives away for one happy day

We can be heroes, just for one day

Though nothing can keep us together

We can steal time, just for one day

We can be heroes forever and ever
We can be lovers just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
We can be lovers just for one day

And you can tell everybody

This is your song
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words

We can be heroes

How wonderful life is

We can be heroes

How wonderful life is

We can be heroes

How wonderful life is

While you're in the world
I will always love you
And I will always love you
And I will always love you
