Ice baby
I saw your girlfriend and she was
Eating her fingers, just another meal
But she waits there in the levee wash
Mixin' cocktails with a plastic tipped cigar
My eyes stick to all the shiny robes
She wears on the protein delta strip
In abandoned house but I will wait there
I'll be waitin' forever
Waitin'
Waitin'
Waitin'
Waitin', go
Minerals, ice deposits daily, drop off
The first shiny robe
I've got a lot of freinds, I, I want
Not here, babe, you took 'em
Every time, I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time, I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time, I sit around
Every time, I sit around
Every time, every time
Every time, every time
Every time
You're my
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
