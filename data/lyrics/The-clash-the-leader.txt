Atom secrets, secret leaflet
Have the boys found the leak yet?
Molehill sets the wheel in motion
His downfall picks up locomotion
You gotta give the people somethin' good to read on a Sunday
Now the leader's wife takes a government car
In the dark to meet the minister
But the leader never leaves his door ajar
Swings a whip from the Boer War
The people must have something good to read on a Sunday
He wore a leather mask for his dinner guests
Totally nude and with deep respect
Proposed a toast to the votes he gets
The feeling of power and the thought of sex
The people must have something good to read on a Sunday
Now the girl let the fat man touch her
Vodka fumes and the feel of a vulture
Driver waited in the embassy car
The fat man's trap was set for capture
The girl let the thin man touch her
Mixing questions, drunken laughter
Ministry car waitin' there
Minister knows his own affair
The people must have something good to read on a Sunday
