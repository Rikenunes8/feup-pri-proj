:
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
It doesn’t matter either from or to
I love noise, you raise hell every time I turn the lights on
Tell me
Have you watched too much MTV?
Because you make drama out of every little thing
So hard to never get it
:
I make coffee just as you like
Play the records I hate every time you want to leave
Read thousands of magazinеs to see
If I can uncover any answers into you
You want a person who always sits complеtely still
And you never ask me what I care about
If only we were utterly honest, here and now
Just want to have Veronica Maggio
:
Because I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
:
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
But all that does is cast pearls before swine
Early and late, you raise hell every time I make a mistake
Tell me
Have you watched too much Wild West?
Because one should look further for taller horses
So hard to always know best
:
I make coffee just as you like
Play the records I hate every time you want to leave
Read thousands of magazines to see
If I can uncover any answers into you
You want a person who always sits completely still
And you never ask me what I care about
If only we were just honest, here and now
Just want to have Veronica Maggio
:
Because I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
:
I just want to fly, just want to fly
Just be free, just be free
No more us, no more us
I have seen it — the right thing
Feel it’s time, feel it’s time
To forget Neil, to forget Neil
No more us, no more us
I have seen it
:
I make coffee just as you want
Play the records I hate every time you want to leave
Read thousands of magazines to see
If I can uncover any answers into you
You want a person who always sits completely still
And you never ask me what I care about
If only I were completely honest
Are you really absolute shit?
:
And I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
No, I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
I know nothing about Neil Young
(Feel it's time, feel it's time)
I know nothing about Neil Young
(To forget Neil, to forget Neil)
I know nothing about Neil Young
(No more us, no more us)
I know nothing about (I can see it)
Neil Young
