I want the talk show
Guess that'll have to do
Up all night BBM-ing you
Outta Tylenol, head still aches
Got enough strength to flip a pancake
Got the luggage packed, waiting by the front
Quarter after 5, it's already 1
I'll say it one last time
Walking out the door at 4:59
5:15, not a minute more
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15, not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16, if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me until 5:15

I think I've gone dumb
Sick on puppy love
Wanna break out
Think I've had enough
The walls are caving in and my thick skin is feeling kinda thin
You've found your way back in
Never thought in May, when we came to June
I would feel this way about you
But I'll say it one last time
I'm walking out the door at 4:59

5:15, not a minute more
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15, not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16, if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me until 5:15
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

At 5:15
Ready for the knock on my door

5:15, not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16, if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me until 5:15

I won't wait another minute, no
When the waves are at my shore
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16, if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me until 5: 15 (5, oh)
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
I'll be waiting for you, hey, hey
Until 5:15, mmmm
Hey
