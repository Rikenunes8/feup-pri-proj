[Intro]
Ooh, feelin'
Listen
[Verse 1]
I go to bed
But sleep won't come
Get up in the night
I couldn't fight my feeling, no
Early in the morning, oh mercy
It's just the same situation, na-na-na
Here came the landlord, yeah
Just a-knocking upon my door, you knockin' upon my door
I've got four hundred month rent to pay
And I can't find a job
[Chorus]
Let me, let me tell you time tough (Time tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
So hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time tough)
Everything is going higher and higher (Higher and higher)
[Verse 2]
Sister Lee cannot bear it
And brother Lincoln hardly stand it, man
They're crying night and day, louder and louder
Nobody to help them make their way
I've got four hundred month rent to pay
And I can't find a dollar
[Chorus]
Let me, let me, let me tell you time tough (Time tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
So hard (So hard)
Time hard (Time hard)
Everything is going higher and higher (Higher and higher)
[Verse 3]
Good times was leading to bad times
But now the bad times take over, ooooh
When I was a little boy
I just keep on feeling it, feeling it, feeling it, feeling it, wow!
Get down![Guitar solo]
Eh, eh, eh
[Chorus]
Time tough (Time tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
So hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time tough)
Everything is going higher and higher (Higher and higher)
[Verse 4]
Can't blame the minister
And you can't blame the preacher
And you can't blame your brother
And you cannot blame your sister
Can't blame your friends
'Cause today is the judgement day
And that's why everyone have to pray
[Chorus]
Let me tell you time tough (Time tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
So hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time tough)
Everything is going higher and higher (Higher and higher)[Outro]
Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
