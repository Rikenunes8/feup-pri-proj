Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce, check it out
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce
[Chorus: Mariah Carey & 
Jermaine Dupri
]
(I gotta shake it off) 'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake it off) 
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here and go somewhere
(I gotta shake it off) Gotta make that move (
Yeah
)
Find somebody who appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta (Shake, shake it off) gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta (Shake you off)
[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & 
Jermaine Dupri
]
By the time you get this message, it's gonna be too late (
Uh-huh
)
So don't bother paging me 'cause I'll be on my way (
What ya doin'?
)
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma, she knows
You're gonna miss me, baby, hate to say I told you so (
Yeah
)
Well, at first I didn't know but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton (
Pack it up
)
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl who loves you more than me[Chorus: Mariah Carey & 
Jermaine Dupri
]
(I gotta shake it off) 'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake it off) 
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here and go somewhere
(I gotta shake it off) Gotta make that move (
Uh-huh
)
Find somebody who appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta (Shake, shake it off) gotta do what's best for me (
Yeah
)
Baby, and that means I gotta (Shake you off, 
watch this
)
[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey & 
Jermaine Dupri

(I gotta) Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off (Gotta shake it off)
What it look like?
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off (
What it do? What it do?
)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off (

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & 
Jermaine Dupri

I found out about a gang of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one by the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was - hold up, my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time (
No
) so I'm leaving you behind (
Uh-huh
)
Yeah, 'cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because I'm never coming back home (
Uh-huh
)
Baby, I'm gone (
Gone
) don't ya know?[Chorus: Mariah Carey & 
Jermaine Dupri

(I gotta shake you off) 'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games like you know I'm here to stay
