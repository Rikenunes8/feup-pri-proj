[Intro]
Hey, yo, Rodney, you ready?
'Cause I'm ready, so let's go
Check it, check it out
Aaliyah makes it hot
Blackground makes it hot
The R.J. makes it hot
To get up, to get up and don't stop
[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright (Ooh)
Let's get this on tonight (Ooh)
It's time to get real loose
Do what you wanna do
Everything's gonna be alright
Let's get this on tonight (Tonight)
It's time to get real loose (Baby)
Do what you wanna do
[Verse 1]
Baby, can we talk about what we came to do
Let's turn this party out
Let me show you what love's about
Come here, baby
And let me show you how tonight

Everything's gonna be alright
Let's get this on tonight (Ooh)

It's time to get real loose (Baby)
Do what you wanna do
[Verse 2]
Now we know what's goin' on
Just come to me and, baby, you will see
That I'm not into playin' games
You can do this, baby, with the L-I-Y-A-H, baby
[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Let's get this on tonight
It's time to get real loose (Real loose)
Do what you wanna do
Everything's gonna be alright (Alright)
Let's get this on tonight (Yeah)
It's time to get real loose (Oh)
Do what you wanna do (When I'm with you, yeah)[Bridge]
When I'm with you, you make me smile (Baby, yes, you do)
Stay with me a little while (A little while)
Don't ever go, 'cause tonight is the night
Baby, I will do anything you wanna do
