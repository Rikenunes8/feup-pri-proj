[Verse 1]
I was staring out the window
The whole time he was talking to me
It was a filthy pane of glass
I couldn't get a clear view
And as he went on and on
It wasn't the outside world I could see
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through
[Chorus]
So I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
[Verse 2]
I was never focused on just one thing
My eyes got fixed when my mind got so
It may look like I'm concentrated on
A very clear view
But I'm as good as asleep
I bet you didn't know
It'd take a lot of it away
If you do
[Chorus 2]
I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than forget what I had to say
Or miss what I should see[Bridge]
Because the fact being that
Whatever's in front of me
Is covering my view
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
I only see what I'm looking through
[Verse 3]
So again I've done the right thing
I was never worried about that
The answer's always been in clear view
But even when the window was cleaned
I still can't see for the fact
That when it's clean
It's so clear I can't tell what I'm looking through
[Chorus 3]
So I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than miss what I should see
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than forget what I had to say
Or miss what I should see
Or break him or her or me
Especially me
