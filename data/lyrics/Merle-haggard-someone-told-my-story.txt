[Verse 1]
I played a brand new record on the jukebox
And I scarcely could believe the song I heard
It told of how you left me for another
It was almost like I'd written every word
[Chorus]
Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you done me wrong
Someone told my story in a song
[Verse 2]
The writer must have seen the way you done me
For he told it all and never missed a line
He told of swinging doors and the jukebox
And he even knew I almost lost my mind
[Chorus]
Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you done me wrong
Someone told my story in a song
