[Verse 1]
Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason, 
it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't country at all
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ray beam station
Beside yourself
[Verse 2]
Keep me out of country and the word
Deal the porch is leading us absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the hull
That this isn't nothing at all
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Straight off the boat
Where to go?
[Chorus]
Callin' out in transit
Callin' out in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio
[Verse 3]
Beside defyin' media too fast
Instead of pushin' palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that before all
That this isn't fortunate at all
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ray beam station
Beside yourself
[Chorus]
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio[Bridge]
Beside yourself
Callin' on a boat
Media's too fast
[Verse 4]
Keep me out of country and the word
Disappointers into us, absurd
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Straight off the boat
Where to go?
[Chorus]
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe
[Outro]
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe
