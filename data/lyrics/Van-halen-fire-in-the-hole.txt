[Verse 1]
In a word to the wisdom tooth
To tell or not the truth
So open up and say amen
Rinse cup, and spit again
[Verse 2]
Forked tongue in doublespeak
Pretty soon you just might spring a leak
Inhale before you begin
Your iron lung's a bag of wind
[Chorus]
There's a fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
There's a fire in the hole
Fire
[Verse 3]
Sweet 'n' sour, filiblister
Faucet pouring, fresh 'n' bitter
Come on smile and say cheese on a count of three
You got a mindful of decavities
[Verse 4]
Chew your words, lest you choke
You better watch your mouth, wash it out with soap
Tongue tied in a tangled web
Your bile inside better left unsaid
[Chorus]
There's a fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
There's a fire in the hole
Fire, ah, shoot it!
[Guitar Solo][Bridge]
Hey-hey-yeah!
Huh!
Yeah!
Hey-hey-yeah!
[Chorus]
There's a fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
There's a fire in the hole
Fire in the hole
There's a fire, fire, fire, a fire
[Outro]
Rudder of ship, which sets the course
Does not the bit, bridle the horse
Great is the forest, set by a small flame
Like a tongue on fire, no one can tame
