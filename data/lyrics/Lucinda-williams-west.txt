Come out West and see
The best it'll ever be
I know you won't stay permanently
But come out West and see
Climb up on a rock
And stretch out in the sun
And close my eyes
And let my imagination run
I'm tracing your initials
In the shining sand
I'm counting out the days
Till I see you again
Who knows what the future holds
Or where the cards may fall?
But if you don't come out West and see
You'll never know at all
I look off in the distance
Blow a kiss and wave
A thousand miles between us
Will disappear someday
I watch as all the starlings
Fly in from the North
The beating of the winds
Echoes the beating of my heart
I sleep out in the desert
Under the stars above
And keep making an effort
To wander in love
Who knows what the future holds
Or where the cards may fall?
But if you don't come out West and see
You'll never know at all
Come out West and see
The best it'll could be
I know you won't stay permanently
But come out West and see
