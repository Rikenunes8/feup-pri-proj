[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much
[Verse 1: Michael & 
Siedah
]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart, at your call
I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, 
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
[Chorus: 
Both
 & 
Siedah
]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
[Verse 2: Michael & 
Siedah
 & 
Both
]
At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me? I'll wait for you
You know how I feel, I won't stop until I hear your voice saying, "I do" 
("I do")
This thing can't go wrong
, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living,
 
if I can't be with you[Chorus: Michael & 
Both
]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(
Oh, oh, and it feels
)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(
Uh-huh
)
I just can't stop loving you
[Bridge: Michael & 
Siedah
 & 
Both
]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I 
want to see you for always
[Chorus: 
Both
]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(
No, baby, if I can't stop
) (Oh)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (
What will I do?
)
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh, oh) (
Oh, woah-woah!
)
