[Verse 1]
They may talk about you cold when you were headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that change with a wink of your eye?
Now no one's talkin' 'bout those crazy days gone by
No one talks about the times you cried
[Chorus]
(Ooh) Little dreamer
(Ooh) Uh, little dreamer
[Verse 2]
And then they went and they voted you least likely to succeed
I had to tell them, baby, you were armed with all you'd need
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout those crazy days gone past
Weren't they amazed when you were really last?
[Chorus]
(Ooh) You are the little dreamer
(Oooh) You were the little dreamer
Yeah, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Yeah, they talk about you cold when you were headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that change with a wink of your eye?
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout the crazy days gone past
Weren't they amazed when you were really last?
[Outro]
(Ooh) You are the little dreamer
(Ooh) Little dreamer, yeah, oh
(Ooh) Yeah, little dreamer
(Ooh) Little dreamer
