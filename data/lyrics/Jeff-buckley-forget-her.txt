[Verse 1]
While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
Cause she'll never change her ways
[Chorus 1]
Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now
[Verse 2]
Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go
[Chorus 1]
Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's somewhere out there now
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Well my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need
Her again
[Chorus 2]
But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's out there somewhere now[Outro]
Oh She was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget you, somehow
Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
