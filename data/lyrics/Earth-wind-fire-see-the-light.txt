Lookin' through the clouds, what do you see?
Sky of gases, child in need
Troubles everywhere, more than I can bear
So I'm searching from within
Help them see the light, the light
I'm a blossom in the sun, sunshine of love
Singing loud to the One I love above
Shine on sun, let your light guide the way
For so long there's been such darkness
Got to be a better way
Keep me, Lord, and help me to grow
So I may reap the fruits of a free and happy soul
Help them see the light
Help them see the light
Give me strength when temptation calls
Lift me up when life's battles make me fall
Shelter me from the evils and the wrongs
So when ya call, dear Lord, I said I'll be strong
Walk with me when the stormy nights are cold
In your hand lies all control, Lord
Master, then when my final song is sung
With your mercy, I pray that you'll say well done
Help them see the light
Help them see the light
