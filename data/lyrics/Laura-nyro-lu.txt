[Verse 1]
Silver was the color
Winter was a snowbell
Mother of the wind boys
Livin' off the lovewell
I was livin' off the lovewell with Lu
[Chorus]
And everybody's calling Luie, Luie Luie
You got a thing about you
Keep the light going for Luie
And Luie keeps on pushing through
Lu Lu, he keeps on pushing
[Verse 2]
Amber was the color
Summer was a flame ride
Cooking up the noon roads
Walking on God's good side
I was walking on God's good side
God's good side with Lu
[Chorus]
And everybody's calling Luie, Luie Luie
You got a thing about you
Keep the light going for Luie
And Luie keeps on pushing
Through, through keeps on pushing
Through, through, he keeps on pushing
[Outro]
I will always be fair
Be there for Lu, for Lu
Forever and ever more
Everybody, everybody, everybody yeah yeah yeah
And everybody's calling Luie, calling Luie
Everybody's calling Luie calling my man
My man Luie, calling Luie, my man Luie
Calling Luie, my man Luie, calling Luie, Luie
People and the captain calling my man Luie, calling Luie
My man Luie, calling Luie, my man Luie, calling Luie Luie
People and the captain calling my man Luie....
