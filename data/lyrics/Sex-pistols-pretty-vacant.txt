[Chorus 1]
There's no point in asking you'll get no reply
Oh just remember I don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us out to lunch
[Chorus 2]
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty we're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A vacant
[Verse 1]
Don't ask us to attend 'cause we're not all there
Oh don't pretend 'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions, 'cause too much ain't for real
Stop your cheap comments, 'cause we know what we feel
[Chorus 2]
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty we're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
And now
And we don't care
[Chorus 1]
There's no point in asking you'll get no reply
Oh just remember I don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find me out to lunch
[Chorus 2]
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty we're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
And now
And we don't care[Outro]
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
And we don't care
