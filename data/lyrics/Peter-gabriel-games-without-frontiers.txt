[Intro]
“A one… two… one, two, four…”
[Refrain: Kate Bush]
Jeux sans frontières
Jeux sans frontières
Jeux sans frontières
Jeux sans frontières
[Verse 1: Peter Gabriel]
Hans plays with Lotte, Lotte plays with Jane
Jane plays with Willi, Willi is happy again
Suki plays with Leo, Sacha plays with Britt
Adolf builds a bonfire, Enrico plays with it
[Pre-Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
Whistling tunes,
 
we hide in the dunes by the seaside
Whistling tunes,
 
we're kissing baboons in the jungle
It's a knockout
[Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
If looks could kill,
 
they probably will
In games without frontiers, 
war without tears
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
Games without frontiers, war without tears
[Refrain: Kate Bush]
Jeux sans frontières
Jeux sans frontières
Jeux sans frontières
[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]
Andre has a red flag, Chiang Ching's is blue
They all have hills to fly them on except for
 
Lin Tai Yu
Dressing up in costumes, playing silly games
Hiding out in treetops, shouting out rude names
[Pre-Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
Whistling tunes,
 we hide in the dunes by the seaside
Whistling tunes, we piss on the goons in the jungle
It's a knockout[Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
Games without frontiers, war without tears
[Refrain: Kate Bush]
