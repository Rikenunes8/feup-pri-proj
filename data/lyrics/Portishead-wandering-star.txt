[Verse 1]
Please, could you stay awhile to share my grief
For it's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake
[Chorus]
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
[Verse 2]
Those who have seen the needle's eye, now tread
Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey
[Chorus]
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
[Verse 3]
Doubled up inside
Take a while to share my grief
Always doubled up inside
Taunted, cruel
[Chorus]
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
