[Verse 1]
Wake up! There's a new day dawning
I think I'll take a little walk for a while
I need shades 'cause the sun is blinding
And I can see for miles and miles
Yeah, I can feel the earth beneath me
I lie down, we are as one
And they look but they cannot find me
I'm off and heading for the sun
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Iâ€™m getting colder
I feel a chill in the air
There's a change in the weather
Here it comes again
Now I can feel the rain
[Chorus]
The wind that brings on the change
Is taking me over
The wind that brings on the rain
Is making me older
[Verse 2]
Downtown the moon is shining
I'm going to dress it up in style
My business everybody's minding
I need to get away for a while
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm getting colder
I feel a chill in the air
There's a change in the weather
Here it comes again
Now I can feel the rain (oh yeah)
[Chorus]
The wind that brings on the change
Is taking me over
The wind that brings on the rain
Is making me older
