[Intro]
Here we go
Yeah!
[Verse 1]
Deep in Denialville
Tryin' a' fight the way I feel
I go jello when you smile
I start blushin', my head rushin'
If you stand too close to me
I might melt down from the heat
If you look my way one more time
I'm gonna go out of my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever you do
[Chorus]
Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me, baby
Oh yeah
[Verse 2]
You stop me in my tracks
My heart pumping to the max
I'm such a sucker for your eyes
They permanently paralyze
[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever you do
[Chorus]
Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me, baby
[Bridge]
(Whatever you do, don't do that to me) Oh
You got my heart under attack
You give me shivers down my back
Do you have to walk the way you do?
I get weak just watching you[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever you do
[Chorus]
Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me, baby
Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me, baby
[Outro]
Don't do that, don't do that
