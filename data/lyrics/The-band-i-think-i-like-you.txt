I was a man without a plan, living and breathing
Oh, I was so far gone
So obsessed with all the fucks I wasn't giving
Posing as so faux strong

Nights turn into days
Days turn into months
I was always alone
Until you came along
Now you've got me singin'
I think I like you maybe more than I should
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so
You do me better than any other love could
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so good
It feels so good

I was a man who couldn't hold a conversation
But with you, I just can't shut up
Now every day is like a permanent vacation
You are my favorite drug (Favorite drug)

Nights turn into days
Days turn into months
I was always alone (Always alone)
Until you came along
Now you've got me singin'

I think I like you maybe more than I should
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so
You do me better than any other love could
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so good
It feels so good
I think I like you, ooh, I think I like you
I think I like you, ooh, I think I like you
I think I like you, ooh, I think I like you
I think I like you, ooh, I think I like you

I think I like you maybe more than I should
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so
You do me better than any other love could
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so
I think I like you maybe more than I should (Maybe more than I should)
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so
You do me better than any other love could (Any other love could)
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so good
It feels so good (Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so good)
You do me better than any other love could (Feels so good)
Hurts like heaven and it feels so, feels so
