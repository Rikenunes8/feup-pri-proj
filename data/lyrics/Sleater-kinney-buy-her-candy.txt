Hey don't you wanna
Run and call her name
If I buy her candy
Will she know who I am
She's famous
She's the best
Cannot lay
My heart to rest
She is selfish
She is kind
No one can say
She is mine
Like water like spring
Fickle fancy fickle girl
Come down from the sky
When I need you the most
She's famous
She's the best
Cannot lay
My heart to rest
She is selfish
She is kind
No one can say
She is mine
