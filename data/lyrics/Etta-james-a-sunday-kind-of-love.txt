[Verse 1]
I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I’d like to know it’s more than love at first sight
And I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah yeah
[Verse 2]
I want a, a love that’s on the square
Can’t seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I’m on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love
[Bridge]
I do my Sunday dreaming, oh yeah
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
Oh, I’m hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way
[Verse 3]
And my arms need someone, someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
Love for all my life, to have and to hold
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love
[Outro]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
I don’t want a Monday
Tuesday or Wednesday
Or Thursday, Friday
Or Saturday
Oh, nothing
But Sunday
Oh yeah
I want a Sunday
Sunday
I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah
Sunday, Sunday
Sunday kind of love
