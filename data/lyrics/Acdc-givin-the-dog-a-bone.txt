She take you down easy
Going down to her knees
Going down to the devil
Down, down to ninety degrees
Ah, she blowing me crazy
'Till my ammunition is dry

Ah, she's using her head again
She's using her head
Ah, she's using her head again
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
Yeah, I'm givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)

Oh, she's no Mona Lisa
No, she's no Playboy star
But she'd send you to Heaven
Then explode you to Mars

Oh, she's using her head again (using her head again)
She's using her head (using her head again)
Ah, she's using her head again (using her head)

I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
Givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm jus' givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)


She got the power of union
Yeah, she only hits when it's hot
And if she likes what you're doing
Yeah, she'll give you the lot
Give it everything, I'm just
Givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
Givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
Givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
Givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (Givin' the dog a bone)
I'm just a-givin' the dog, givin' the dog, givin' the dog'
Uhh, I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone, ahhh, no
