I've got money, and now I need love
I've got money, and now I need love
When I get my lovin', I'll be the happy one
I've got money now, no more money I need
Oh, I got money, no more money I need
Hey, I don't have to worry
I don't have to let my heart leave
Hey, come on now
I need your love now
I need your love so bad
You're the best thing I ever had
Oh yeah
Hey, I've got money now, no more money I want
Oh, but love, don't leave me, don't
When I get my lovin', I'll be the happy one
Oh, OH, yeah yeah yeah
I need your love so bad
I need your love so bad
Turn your love-light on me
And ease my misery
Hey, I believe I'll sing the blues one more time
I'll believe I'll blow it one more 'gain
I've got to try it one more time
I'm going insane
Hey, come on
Oh, OH, I got to sing the blues
Best thing I've ever had
I need your love so bad
And OH...OH, tell the truth
Tell the truth, tell the truth
I gotta sing the blues
Goodbye, so long
That's all, I'm gone...AHHH
