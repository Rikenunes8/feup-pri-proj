[Verse 1]
May be the last time (Maybe the last time)
It may be the last time (Maybe the last time)
May be the last time we shake hands (Maybe the last time)
May be the last time we make plans (Maybe the last time)
Oh I, oh I, I don't know
[Verse 2]
May be the last time (Maybe the last time)
I got a heart of stone (Maybe the last time)
Believe me, I don't wanna be alone (Maybe the last time)
Oh I, oh I, I don't know
[Bridge]
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
When you're all alone
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
You wanna talk on the telephone now
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
You wanna give your heart a little ease
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
And just about the time you get comfortable
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
Your operator says, "Signal when you're through, please"
Oh I, oh I, I don't know
[Verse 3]
May be the last time (Maybe the last time)
AH, it may be the last time (Maybe the last time)
I gotta scream, AH, may be the last time (Maybe the last time)
AH, may be the last time (Maybe the last time)
Oh I, oh I, I don't know
[Outro]
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
AH, I'm all alone
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
I ain't got nobody to call my own
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
'Cause I don't know it might be the last time
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
Look around you over and over again
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
And shake hands with your best friend
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
You might never, never, never see them again now
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
OW, hey hey, help me somebody
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
It may be the last time
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
I would like to tell you some more
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
Sorry, I gotta go
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
AH, Lord have mercy
(Ha, ha, doo wee ooh)
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH
