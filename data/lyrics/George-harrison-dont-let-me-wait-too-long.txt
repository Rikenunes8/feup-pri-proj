[Chorus]
How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long
How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long
How I miss you baby
So don't let me wait too long
How I miss you baby
So don't let me wait too long
[Verse 1]
When you're here by my side
Now only you know how to dry up
All of those tears that I've cried
Here with your love
Now only you know how to lay it down
Like it came from above
You know it's you that I love
[Chorus]
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
[Verse 2]
When you're here by my side
Now only you know how to dry up
All of those tears that I've cried
Here, with your love
Now only you know how to lay it down
Like it came from above
You know it's you that I love
[Chorus]
So don't let me wait too long
Ah don't let me wait too long
How I miss you baby
Baby, so don't let me wait too long
How I miss you baby
Baby, so don't let me wait
Don't let me wait
Don't let me wait too long
