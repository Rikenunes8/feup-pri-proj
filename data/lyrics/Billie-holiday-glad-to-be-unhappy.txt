Look at yourself
If you had the sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself
Do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it on the chin
You have lost that toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a-jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble
Fools rush in, so here am I
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, so here am I
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a stray baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad
Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a stray baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad
