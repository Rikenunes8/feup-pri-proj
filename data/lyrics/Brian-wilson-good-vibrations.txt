[Verse 1]
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And she's already workin' on my brain
I, I only looked in her eyes
But I picked up something I just can't explain
Man, I'm pickin' up
[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's givin' me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good, good, good, good vibrations, Oom bop bop)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good, good, good, good vibrations, Oom bop bop)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
[Verse 2]
I, I bet I know what she's like
And I can feel how right she'd be for me
It's weird how she comes in so strong
And I wonder what she's pickin' up from me
And I'm pickin' up
[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good, good, good, good vibrations, Oom bop bop)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good, good, good, good vibrations, Oom bop bop)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
[Bridge]
(Ahh)
(Ah, my, my, what elation)
I don't know where, but she sends me there
(Ah, my, my, what a sensation)
(Ah, my, my, what elations)
(Ah, my, my, what)[Hook]
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'
Hum-be-num, hum-be-num (Oh)
Hum-be-num, hum-be-num (Oh)
Hum-be-num, hum-be-num (Oh)
Hum-be-num, hum-be-num (Oh)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good, good, good, good vibrations, Oom bop bop)
She's giving me the excitations (Oom bop bop, excitations)
