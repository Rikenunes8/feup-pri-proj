[Intro]
Portishead
Portishead
Portishead
[Verse 1]
Inside, you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere
Where they can forget
[Verse 2]
Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean
Will not be grasped
[Chorus]
All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
[Verse 3]
Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares
Who dares to condemn?
[Chorus]
All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
