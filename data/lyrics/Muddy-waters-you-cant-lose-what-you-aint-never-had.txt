[Verse 1]
I once had a pretty little girl
I lose my baby — ain't that sad?
Oh, you know I once had a pretty little girl
I lose my baby — ain't that sad?
[Chorus]
Well, you know you can't spend what you ain't got
You can't lose what you ain't never had
[Verse 2]
I had money in the bank
I got busted — boys, ain't that sad?
Oh, you know I had some money in the bank
I got busted, baby — ain't that bad?
[Chorus]
Well, you know you can't spend what you ain't got
You can't lose what you ain't never had
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
I had a sweet little home
It got burnt down, boys — ain't that bad?
Oh, you know it was my own fault
People — ain't that sad?
[Chorus]
Well, you know you can't spend what you ain't got
You can't lose what you ain't never had
