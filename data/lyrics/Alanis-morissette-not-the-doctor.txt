[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the filler if the void is solely yours
I don't wanna be your glass
Of single malt whiskey hidden in the bottom drawer
And I don't wanna be a bandage if the wound is not mine
Lend me some fresh air
I don't wanna be adored for what I merely represent to you
I don't wanna be your babysitter
You're a very big boy now
I don't wanna be your mother
I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months
Show me the back door
[Chorus]
Visiting hours are nine to five
And if I show up at ten past six, well, I
Already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see, it's too much to ask for
And I am not the doctor
(Oh, I am not the, oh)
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be the sweeper
Of the egg shells that you walk upon
And I don't wanna be your other half
I believe that one and one make two
I don't wanna be your food or the light
From the fridge on your face at midnight, hey
What are you hungry for?
I don't wanna be the glue that holds your pieces together
I don't wanna be your idol
See, this pedestal is high, and I'm afraid of heights
I don't wanna be lived through a vicarious occasion
Please, open the window
[Chorus]
Visiting hours are nine to five
And if I show up at ten past six, well, I
Already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see, it's too much to ask for
And I am not the doctor
(Oh, I am not the, oh)[Verse 3]
I don't wanna live on 'Someday'
When my motto is 'Last Week'
, and I
I don't wanna be responsible
For your fractured heart and its wounded beat
And I don't wanna be a substitute
For the smoke you've been inhaling
Well, what do you thank me, what do you thank me for?
[Chorus]
Visiting hours are nine to five
And if I show up at ten past six, well, I
Already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see, it's too much to ask for
And I am not the doctor
(Ooh, I am not the, oh)
