This next song is from A Night at the Opera
This is about a [Beep beep beep]
We call him Death on Two Legs
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
All my money
And you want more
[Pre-Chorus]
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules
And your narrow minded cronies
You are fools of the first division
[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart, of your own
[Verse 2]
Kill joy, bad guy, big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss
My ass goodbye!
[Verse 3]
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good feel good?
I feel good[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
[Segue to "
Killer Queen
