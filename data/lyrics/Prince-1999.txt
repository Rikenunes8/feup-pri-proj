[Intro: Prince]
Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun
[Verse 1: Prince, 
Lisa
, 
Dez
, 
All
]
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this morning
Could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care
[Chorus: Prince 
and All
]
'Cause they say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999
[Verse 2: Prince, 
Lisa
, 
Dez
, 
All
]
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us
My mind says, "Prepare to fight"
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
Yeah
[Chorus: Prince 
and All
]
They say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah, yeah, shh
[Verse 3: Prince, 
Lisa
, 
Dez
, 
All
]
Lemme tell ya somethin'
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door
, oh
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby, he's ready to roar, yeah, yeah
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day, oh
But before 
I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away
Oh[Chorus: Prince 
and All
]
They say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
(We're runnin' outta time)
So tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight, we gonna, we gonna, oh
Say it one more time
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
No, no
Tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight, we gonna, we gonna, woo
[Bridge: Prince 
and All
]
Alright, 1999
You say it, 1999
Ooh, 1999, oh, 1999
Don't stop, don't stop, say it one more time
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
Yeah, yeah
Tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight, we're gonna, we're gonna, woo

We could all die any day (
1999
)
I don't wanna die
I'd rather dance my life away 
1999
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say
Everybody, everybody say, 
"Party"
C'mon now, you say, 
"Party"
That's right, everybody say 
"Party"
Can't run from the revelation, no (

Sing it for your nation y'all, 
"Party"
Tell me what you're singin', baby say, "

Telephone's a-ringin', mama

Everybody, two times, 
"Party"
Woo, work it down to the ground, say, 
"Party"
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Come on,

Got a lion in my pocket mama, say, 
"Party"
Oh, and he's ready to roar
