[Chorus 1]
Let me let you in on a secret
How to treat a woman right
If you're looking for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen overnight
[Verse 1]
First you gotta learn to listen
To understand her deepest thoughts
She needs to know you can be friends
Before she'll give you all she's got
[Pre-Chorus]
If you start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part
[Chorus 2]
If you wanna get to know her (Know her)
Really get inside her mind
If you wanna move in closer (Closer)
Take it slow, yeah, take your time
You must start from the heart and then...
If you wanna touch her
Really wanna touch her
If you wanna touch her, ask!
Mmm, baby
[Verse 2]
A little physical attraction
Romantic, old-fashioned charm
And a lot of love and tenderness
Is gonna get you into her arms
[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part
[Chorus 2]
If you wanna get to know her (Know her)
Really get inside her mind
If you wanna move in closer (Closer)
Take it slow, yeah, take your time
You must start from the heart and then...
If you wanna touch her
Really wanna touch her
If you wanna touch her, ask![Chorus 1]
Let me let you in on a secret
How to treat a woman right
If you're looking for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen
No, it ain't gonna happen
[Chorus 2]
If you wanna get to know her
Oh, really get inside her mind
Deep down
If you wanna move in closer
Take it slow, yeah, take your time, no, no, no
If you wanna get to know her (Get to know her)
Really get inside her mind (Oh, really get inside her mind)
If you wanna move in closer (Move in closer, baby)
Take it slow, yeah, take your time
You must start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part
If you wanna touch her
Really wanna touch her
If you wanna touch her, ask!
