[Verse 1]
In another land
Where the breeze and the trees and flowers were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand
[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
[Chorus]
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
I opened my eyes
[Verse 2]
We walked across the sand
And the sea and the sky and the castles were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the spray flew high and the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand
[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
[Chorus]
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
When I opened my eyes
[Verse 3]
We heard the trumpets blow (da, da-da)
And the sky turned red when I accidentally said
That I didn't know
How I came to be here, not fast asleep in bed
I stood and held your hand[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else's hand
[Chorus]
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
I opened my eyes
Much to my surprise
[Outro]
