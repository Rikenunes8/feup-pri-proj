[Verse 1]
Along the banks of rivers Zion
Sang a fallen and forsworn
The chain
Of human rage
And let between an ocean rain
And lambs so led, I stayed
[Chorus]
If this be life, our evening's prayer
Or death's denouement
A thorned idyll that's offered no one
And I've stood for no one
Then father, I'm nowhere
I'm no closer to your throne
[Verse 2]
Swirling forth, the sea conscripted
Each, the dead and nursery rhyme
At voice
A trailing drone
And baptized by the breath of pain
I crossed heart's knave and swore
[Chorus]
If this be life, our evening's prayer
Or death's denouement
A thorned idyll that's offered no one
And I've stood for no one
Then father, I'm nowhere
I'm no closer to your throne[Bridge]
Swirling forth (Swirling)
The dead and nursery rhyme
[Chorus]
If this be life, our evening's prayer
Or death's denouement
A thorned idyll that's offered no one
And I've stood for no one
Then father, I'm nowhere
I'm no closer to your throne
[Outro]
Pacific glass, these gifts rend senseless
And knell, repentless
The auger of the cosmic traveler
As god's own straggler
Who's vowed, unopposed
To embody word and shore
