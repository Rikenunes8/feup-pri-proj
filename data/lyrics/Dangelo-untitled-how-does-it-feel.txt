[Verse 1]
Girl, it's all on you
Have it your way
And if you want, you can decide
And if you'll have me
I can provide everything that you desire
If you get a feeling
Feeling that I'm feeling
Won't you come closer (Mm) to me, baby? (Hey)
Girl, you already got me right where you want me, baby
I, I just wanna be your man
[Chorus]
How does it feel? Yeah (Oh)
How does it feel ? Yeah, yeah (Said I wanna know, how does it feel?)
How does it feel? Yeah (How?)
How does it feel? Yeah (Yeah, oh)
[Verse 2]
I wanna stop (Wanna stop)
(Playing all) Silly little games you and me play
And I am feeling right on
If you feel the same way, baby
Let me know (Let me know) right away
I'd love to make you wet
In between your thighs 'cause
I love when it comes inside you, mm
I get so excited when I'm around you (Oh)
Baby (Woah)
Oh, ah, oh, baby
[Chorus]
How does it feel? Yeah (Wanna know how it feels, yeah)
How does it feel? Yeah (Said did it ever cross your mind?)
How does it feel? Yeah (How, baby? Oh)
How does it feel? Yeah (Oh)
How does it feel? Yeah (Tell me how it feels, yeah)
How does it feel? Yeah (Said itâ€™s been on my mind)
How does it feel? Yeah (Oh, oh)
How does it feel? Yeah
Ooh, long time, uh[Bridge]
Said it's been on my mind, yeah
Baby, close the door
Listen, girl, I've got something I wanna show you
All I wanna do
Wish you'd open up (Wish you'd open up)
'Cause I wanna take the walls down with you
Oh, yeah
If you want me to, baby (Yeah)
Only if you want me to, baby (Yeah)
Baby, baby, baby
Ah-ah (Ah)
Ah-ah (Ah)
Ah, only if you want me to, baby
[Interlude]
I wanna
I wanna lay you down
Kiss you all around
All around, all around
Make you feel
Oh-oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
How does it feel? (Woo, feel)
How does it feel? (Said I gotta know right now, yeah)
How does it feel? (Let me take off your clothes and I'll)
How does it feel? (I'll-I'll-I'll, I'll-I'll, yeah, yeah, baby)
How does it feel? (Wanna take you away from here, baby)
How does it feel? (Take you on a little trip back home, yeah)
