Afraid of the light
So turn on the dark
Walk in the park all by yourself
Channel 2 is just news
Channel 4 is a bore
Channel 9 is just a waste of time
Hey, no one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
No one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
No one told you it's (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
Prog [?] goes as far
As you can spit
Yeah, spit in your car
Yeah, come on and sit and sit and sit and sit
Out latest addition
Stranger than fiction
Stranger than something you can find on TV
Hey, no one told you it's (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
No one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
No one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
They're smiling of your face
You're such a beautiful face
38 hours ... [?]

Well, it's
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
The latest addiction is much
Stranger than than fiction it's much
Better than something you can find on your heart [?]And no one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
I guess no one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
No one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
No one told you (perfectly lethal, perfectly lethal)
