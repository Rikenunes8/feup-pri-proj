And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted an inch in temperance building,
 high on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gazed down on 
Hunger City
No more big wheels
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs
 assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now,
 the year of the Diamond Dogs

This ain't rock and roll! This is genocide!
