[Verse 1]
The spark in your eye sets my, soul on fire
Your voice is like a angel above
The touch of your hand woman drives me insane
But baby, I wants to be loved
[Verse 2]
I'm crazy about every little, thing you do
I even cherish your hug
Your kisses so sweet, honey, they can't be beat
But baby I wants to be loved
[Harmonica Solo]
Well, well, well
[Bridge]
Every time I ask you for a date
You don't come at all or you awful late
I ask you to dance a little spin
You said wait a minute daddy, here come my friend
[Verse 3]
I love the way you walk when you pass me by
Even when you trying to snub
The touch of your hand, honey, drives me insane
But baby I wants to be loved
