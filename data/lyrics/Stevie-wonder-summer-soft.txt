[Verse 1]
Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your windowpane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine
[Pre-Chorus]
And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October
[Chorus]
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play
[Verse 2]
Winter Wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer, he begins
Forcing danger's way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when, he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find
[Pre-Chorus]
And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
'Cause you've been fooled by April
[Chorus]
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone[Outro]
You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone
You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone
