He’s gonna take you when you’re alone
And gonna pay you to take you home
He’s gonna press your ears to the light
And then I’m laughing at the way you go
Hey, that cow moaning alone
Kind of sure that I’m gonna call you “bleat”
Why don’t you try to laugh along?
I’m gonna know when you call me “blow”
I’m all alone, alone you say
“Why do you laugh?”
Do you wanna hide in a corner?
Why do you try to be alone?
Why do you think they have gone?
Gone away and how?
You’re alone
Give it a try, you’re gonna watch the time
Give me a hound and dance alone
Hey, you know that I’m no surprise
Hide anyone that we’re gonna know
I’ve been alone, alone, Mr. Wall knows anyone
I know that I’m not away at all
I know that I’m besides your hound
You’re just alone giving five in a loan
Well, you’re sure that friend is your all
And to end all today down
You pay the pound and then you’re all alone
You pay anything and are you all too well
Somebody down, do you end your ways?
You got all I tell you of your way to be alone
I said “You, guy!”
You know you’re gonna end without you alone
And you say the hell is all alone
All alone, you’re insane, your eyes
Can’t pick the eye in the loan and you moan alone
Ending up on walfare ‘cause I know how
I like, will fall ‘cause I know like I someday
All alone like a something all alone
All alone, all
And try this song like you found some dramatic
And you’re doing something
Try your own, show them all
Then you try doing without the morning thing
You talk a minute and all too long
For anything, yes, it’s all too long
No any longer, add up all the things
There’s somebody in there, it’s all they do
Do you break it long all alone?
And now the pitch is falling at you
And I ain’t sure if I’m wrong or right
Warn everyone when you go
I found a thing worn, time worn
Again all alone all night
That thing all night
Don’t you know, honey, I’m all alone?
Don’t you know when you hope to blow?
All at my fly that flight
She just wants to cry by that every vow
She gotta puts on bad
All alone she blows
You’re all alone and all ahead
What you take is moan and moan
Why show aloud?
Why do you have to cry alone?
All alone, taste the blow
Moan, to howl aloud
I don’t need it
I don’t need it
I don’t need it
I’m gonna take you when you’re all alone
You howl and howl, you just show alone
And you try just one insane and the why
And I try to warn you on the way we
Find you alone
The way you blow, understand?
The boy hound
The boy hound
The boy hound
Finding its way alone
Alone, way it’s to go
All alone, all alone
Do they warn you at all?
Do they call you MC Light, you?
By the drive to sight alone
The sight alone, the telephone
Telephone I call you on
I say “Hide.”
This is how I call this sane girl:
“Pinch”
