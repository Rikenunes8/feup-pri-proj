It sure is good to see you again
Oh-oh, oh
Oh, no, oh, no, no
No, oh, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know some things have changed since the last I've seen you
Some was good, some for the bad, baby, bad, baby
All and all, I can't complain, that's what I've been through, baby
But seeing you reminds me of the precious times we've had (Huh)
And I wondered all this time 'bout how you been
And I hoped by chance, I'd see you once again
I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again
I long to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin

Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh (Uh)

I know you got someone and I got somebody too (Huh)
But I'm unhappy and I miss the shit we used to do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I miss your smile, your mouth, your laughter, baby (Huh)
Never bumped into your kind before or after
(And I'm wonderin', baby)

(And I'm wonderin', baby)
And I wondered all this time 'bout how you been (Oh, oh)
(Said I've been wonderin')
And I hoped by chance I'd see you once again (How you been, girl?)
(Would it be alright?)
I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again (Kiss you, baby, yeah)
(Oh-oh, yeah, baby, baby)
I love to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin (Gin)
Yeah (Mm)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Hey)
Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah

I know you gotta be gettin' back to your own thing (Oh-oh-oh, you got your own thing)
(Baby)
Baby, you got yours, I got mine
I hope you know that you could call me, girl, if things change (Yeah, yeah)
And if you wanna, we could catch up on some lost time

(And I'm wonderin', baby)
And I wondered all this time 'bout how you been (Oh, oh)
(Said I've been wonderin')
And I hoped by chance I'd see you once again (How you been, girl?)
(And would you mind if I kiss you, baby? Oh yeah)
I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again (Yeah, yeah)
I love to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin (Gin)

Gin
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, that's cool
