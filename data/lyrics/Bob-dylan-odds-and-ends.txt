[Verse 1]
Now, I stand in awe and I shake my face
You break your promise all over the place
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Just you comin’ in spilling juice over me
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
[Verse 2]
Now, you take your file and you bend my head
I never can remember anything that you said
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
You’re always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
[Verse 3]
Now, I’ve had enough, my box is clean
You know what I’m saying and you know what I mean
From now on you’d best get on someone else
While you’re doing it, keep that juice to yourself
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
