(Woh, come on)
The kids want a little action
The kids want a little fun
The kids all have to get their kicks
Before the evening's done
Cause they're goin' to
(High school) rah, rah, rah
(High school) sis, boom, bah
(High school) hey, hey, hey
You better let them have their way
They only wanna 
shake it up, baby
Dance to the rockin' bands
They only want a little excitement
They like to get a little outta hand
Cause they're goin' to
(High school) rah, rah, rah
(High school) sis, boom, bah
(High school) hey, hey, hey
You better let them have their way

The kids know what the deal is
They're getting farther out everyday
We're gonna be takin' over
You better get out of the way
Cause we're goin' to

(High school) hey, hey, hey
You better get out of the way
