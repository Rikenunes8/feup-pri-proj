[Intro]
Hey, hey, baby
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Send it up
Send it through
Send it back to you
Send it up
Send it through
Send it back to you
[Verse 1]
Your inner view to me
Is something that I do desire
Struggling to see a new somethin' that I fantasize (Huh)
So I'm sending (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Send it up
Send it through (Send it)
Send it back to you (Huh)
(And if I send it all back, baby)
Send it up
Send it through
(Know I gotta send it on)
Send it back to you (Oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
You can't disguise your emotions, baby
You know that I see in your eyes (I see it)
Your soul's in me, your soul's somethin' that I (Oh-oh) feel inside (Hey)
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run (If I run)
Lord, only knows how far that I and I (Huh) will fall behind
Gotta find a better place, find a better space
So that I, oh
So my life may be the one reason why, baby[Interlude]
Hey
Oh
Oh-oh-oh, woah-woah-woah
Tell me what will I do, baby?
Tell me what will I do
Send it on back to you
Send it right back to you
[Bridge]
Hold on, be strong, if you're home
(Move on, yeah)
Move on, go home, you'll get home (Oh-oh-oh)
(Ah)
If you're feelin' insecure
You can be sure, it's all the way, yeah
Even if it take forever and a day for me to do
I gotta send it on to you (Ooh)
[Vamp]
What will I do, baby? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Tell me what will I do
Send it on
Send it right back to you (Huh)
Oh, send it on
Send it on (Mm)
Send it on
Whenever you want to
Send it on (Yeah)
When it gets cold, babe
Send it on
Cold outside
Send it on (Mm)
All your dreams (Mm)
Send it on
When you get lonely
Send it on
We all get lonely sometimes
Send it on
Pick up the phone
Send it on (Huh)
In the morning
Send it on
Or in the evening
Send it on
And in the midnight hours
Send it on
Yeah, baby
Send it on
You can send it on, baby
Send it on
Whenever you're in need, babe
Send it on (Huh)
Oh, whenever you're in need
Send it on
Just call me, baby
Send it on (Mm, oh)
Send on by-by, baby
Send it on
Oh, sometimes it make me want to stop and say (Ooh)
Mm, mm-mm (Ooh)

Sometimes (Ooh)
Sometimes
We don't know what else to say, but, huh (Ooh)
Mm-mm (Ooh)
And it's alright, it's alright, babe (Ooh)
You see, hey, hey
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Ooh)
So you know, baby, we gotta get on, on (Ooh)
Ooh (Ooh)[Outro]
Oh, what will I do?
Tell me what will I do
Send it on back to you, babe
Send it right back to you
Oh-oh
Oh, oh
