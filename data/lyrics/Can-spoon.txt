Carrying my own in the afternoon
Hiding a spoon, she will be soon
With their fork, with the knife
Speaks me a joke, she slips here alive
Carrying my own in the afternoon
Hiding a spoon, she will be soon
With their fork, with the knife
Speaks me a joke, she slips here alive
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Carrying my own in the afternoon
Hiding a spoon, she will be soon
With their fork, with the knife
Speaks me a joke, she slips here alive
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
