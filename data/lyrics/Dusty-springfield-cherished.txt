I said love ain't no good unless it's cherished, mmm
I said love can't be good unless it's cherished, oh no
You and me
We gotta get something understood
We gotta separate all the bad from the good
We gotta do all the things we thought we never could
It's time to wake up
Our love is on the brink
And we've had enough time to think
Can't you see that love can't be no good unless it's cherished?
Oh, baby, believe me, love can't be no good unless it's cherished, mmm, mmm
You and me
Should never let nothing come between
We gotta separate all the fat from the lean
We got to stick together like we're a team
It's time to wake up
Our love, our love is on the brink, yeah
We've had enough time to think
I said, love can't be good unless it's cherished, no, baby
True love, just no good unless it's cherished, ooh, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Now, our love is on the brink
And we've had enough time to think, yes
I said, love can't be no good unless it's cherished
Believe me, love can't be good unless it's cherished
Oh, no good, no good, no good
Love, can't be no good, no good, no good, no good, no good, no good
I said, love can't be no good unless it's cherished
You know it, baby, oh I
