[Verse 1]
Everybody's had a few
Now they're talkin' about who knows who
I'm goin' back to the 
Crescent City
Where everything's still the same
This town has said what it has to say
Now I'm after that back highway
And the longest bridge I've ever crossed
Over Pontchartrain
[Chorus]
Tu le ton son temps
That's what we'd say
We used to dance
The night away
Me and my sister
Me and my brother
We used to walk
Down by the river
[Verse 2]
Mama lives in Mandeville
I can hardly wait until
I can hear my zydeco
And laissez le bon temps rouler
And take rides in open cars
My brother knows where the best bars are
Let's see how these blues'll do
In the town where the good times stay
[Chorus]
Tu le ton son temps
That's what we'd say
We used to dance
The night away
Me and my sister
Me and my brother
We used to walk
Down by the river
