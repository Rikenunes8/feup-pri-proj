[Verse 1]
Super summer, sugar coppin' in the mornin'
Do your shoppin', baby
Whoa, I love my lovething
Super ride inside my lovething
You may disappear
But you'll be back, I swear
[Chorus]
Would you love to love me, baby?
I would love to love you, baby, now
Would you love to love me, baby?
I would love to love you, baby, now, baby, now
Mama, it's my pain!
[Verse 2]
Super summer sugar coppin' in the mornin'
Do your shoppin', baby
Whoa, I love my lovething
Super ride inside my lovething
You may leave the fair
But you'll be back, I swear
[Chorus]
Would you love to love me, baby?
I would love to love you, baby, now
Would you love to love me, baby?
I would love to love you, baby, now, baby, now
[Bridge]
I keep hearin' Mother cryin'
I keep hearin' Daddy through his grave
Little girl, of all the daughters
You were born a woman, not a slave
Oh, I hate my winsome lover!
Tell him I've had others at my breast
But tell him he has held my heart
And only now am I a virgin, I confess
I confess!
[Outro]
Love my lovething - Love is surely gospel
Love my lovething - Love is surely gospel
Love my lovething - Love is surely gospel
Love my lovething - Love is surely gospel
Love my lovething - Love is surely gospel
Love my lovething
