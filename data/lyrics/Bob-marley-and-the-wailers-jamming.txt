[Intro]
Ooh, yeah, alright
We're jammin'
I wanna jam it with you
We're jammin', jammin'
And I hope you like jammin' too
[Verse 1]
Ain't no rules, ain't no vow, we can do it anyhow
I'n'I will see you through
'Cause everyday we pay the price, we're the living sacrifice
Jammin' till the jam is through
[Chorus 1]
We're jammin'
To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
We're jammin'
And I hope this jam is gonna last
[Verse 2]
No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can be bought nor sold
We all defend the right; Jah - Jah children must unite
Your life is worth much more than gold
[Chorus 2]
We're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord
We're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
We're jammin' right straight from Yard
[Bridge]
Yeh! Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah seated in Mount Zion
And rules all creation
[Chorus 3]
Yeah, we're — we're jammin' (Wotcha-wa)

See, I wanna jam it wid you
We're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
I'm jammed, I hope you're jammin' too[Verse 3]
Jam's about my pride,

To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can't resist
So jam by my side
