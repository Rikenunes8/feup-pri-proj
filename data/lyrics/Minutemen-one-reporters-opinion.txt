What can be romantic to Mike Watt?
He's only a skeleton
His body is a series of points
No height, length or width
In his joints, he feels life
His strongest connection
Between the yelling and the sleep
Pain is the toughest riddle
He's chalk
He's a dartboard
His sex is disease
He's a stop sign
He's chalk
He's a dartboard
His sex is disease
He's a stop sign
