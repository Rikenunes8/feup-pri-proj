[Verse 1]
I wanna go all over the world and start living free
I know that there's somebody who is waiting for me
I'll build a boat, steady and true
As soon as it's done, I'm gonna sail along in a dream
Of my dear someone
[Verse 2]
One little star smiling tonight knows where you are
Stay, little star, steady and bright to guide me afar
Rush, little wind, over the deep, for now I've begun
Hurry and take me straight into the arms
Of my dear someone
[Outro]
Hurry and take me into the arms
Of my dear someone
