[Verse 1]
Well, the sun is slowly sinking down
The moon is surely rising
This old world must still be spinning 'round
And I still love you
[Chorus]
So close your eyes, you can close your eyes, it's alright
I don't know no love song, I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
You can sing this song when I'm gone
[Verse 2]
Well, it won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
No one's gonna take that time away
And you can stay as long as you like
[Chorus]
So close your eyes, you can close your eyes, it's alright
I don't know no love song, I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
You can sing this song when I'm gone
[Chorus]
So close your eyes, you can close your eyes, it's alright
I don't know no love song, I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
You can sing this song when I'm gone
