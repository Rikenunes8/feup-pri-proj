Feel so good inside myself Don't want to move
Feel so good inside myself Don't need to move
As I grow up I'm growing down. And when I'm lost
I know I will be found
Feel so good Don't want to move
Feel so good inside myself. Don't need to move
I
Feel so good inside myself, Don't want to move
I
Feel so good inside myself, Don't want to move
Another place, another time And when I realize
I'm still all mine . . 
I
I
Yeh I
I feel
I feel so good
Want to move. Want to move. Feel so good. Want to move
Feel so good. Want to move
Feel so good inside myself Don't want to move
Feel so good inside myself, Don't need to move
Don't want to move Feel so good inside myself. Don't want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good Don't want to move
Feel so good inside myself, Don't need to move
Want to move. Feel so good, can not move. Feel so good, can not move
Don't need to move. I feel so good Don't need to move
Don't need to move. Don't want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move
