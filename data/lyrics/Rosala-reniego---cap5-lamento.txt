Tiri, tiri, tiri, ay
Ay, ay ya, ya ya ya ay

Ay, I laugh on the outside
And I cry on the inside
I laugh on the outside
And I cry on the inside

And for more pities
For more little pities
Of this sorrow of mine
Remedy I do not find
I laugh on the outside
And I cry on the inside
Like the rejection
Like the rejection
Oh, rejection
I resent my fate
Like the rejection
Like the rejection
Oh, ay, ay the hour that I met you
