[Verse 1]
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls, TV antennas in the back
[Chorus]
You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got
[Verse 2]
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
Gangster whitewalls, TV antennas in the back
[Chorus]
You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
[Verse 1]
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls, TV antennas in the back[Chorus]
You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got
[Outro]
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
Diamonds in the back
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
That's why I'm not driving
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
Not driving
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Digging the scene with the gangster lean
