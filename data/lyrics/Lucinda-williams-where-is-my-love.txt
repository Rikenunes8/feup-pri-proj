Where - where is my love
Where - where is my love
Is my love in Helena
Eating sweet potato pies
Sure as hell won't be tellin' ya
Even as much as a little white lie
Is my love in Tupelo
Whispering down the blues
Knowing things he shouldn't know
And giving away what he can't use
Where - where is my love
Where - where is my love
Where - where is my love
Where - where is my love
Is my love in Birmingham
Making honey from the bees
Overjoyed to be my man
And rolling up his flannel sleeves
Is my love in Gainesville
Grinning, radiant and warm
Drinking whiskey 'til he's had his fill
Inspired by a summer storm
Where - where is my love
Where - where is my love
