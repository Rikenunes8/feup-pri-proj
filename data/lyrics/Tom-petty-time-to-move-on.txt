[Chorus]
It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
[Verse 1]
Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
She's an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector
[Verse 2]
Broken skyline, which way to love land
Which way to something better
Which way to forgiveness
Which way do I go
[Chorus]
It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
[Verse 3]
Sometime later, getting the words wrong
Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenaline
Like breakin' up a dogfight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time
I'm losing my mind
[Chorus]
It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
