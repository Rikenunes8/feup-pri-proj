Remember the nights I cried
You were doing that old Cuban slide
All night, I tried and tried
I could not master the Cuban slide
Remember the night I started to weep
Under lights, you did the creep
That night, I could not sleep
Oh Lord, how goes the creep?
Ai, yi, ai, wanna dance but my feet won't let me
Ai, yi, ai, yi, wanna dance, would someone help me?
Ai, yi, ai, yi, wanna dance but my feet won't let me
Ai, yi, ya
Last night, I could not talk
On the street, you did the Charing Cross walk
Up and down, I swoop and stalk
Only I can run but I can't walk
Ai, yi, ai, wanna dance but my feet won't let me
Ai, yi, ai, yi, wanna dance, would someone help me?
Ai, yi, ai, yi, wanna dance, my feet won't let me
Ai, yi, ya
Remember the nights I cried
You were doing that old Cuban slide
All night, I tried and tried
I could not master the Cuban slideAi, yi, ai, wanna dance but my feet won't let me
Ai, yi, ai, yi, wanna dance, would someone help me?
Ai, yi, ai, yi, wanna dance but my feet won't let me
Ai, yi, ya
Now dance
