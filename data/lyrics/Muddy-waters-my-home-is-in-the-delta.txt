[Verse 1]
Well my home's in the delta
Way out on that farmer's road
Now you know I'm living in Chicago
And people, I sure do hate to go
Now you know I'm leaving here in the morning
Won't be back no more
Well I know my little baby
This girl don't know what a-shape I'm in
You know I haven't had no loving
Boy you know, in God knows when
[Chorus]
Now you know I just been sitting here thinking
Wondering where in the world she been
Look out
[Verse 2]
Well I feel like crying
But you know, the tears won't come down
I feel like crying
But you know the tears won't come down
Ah, you know I got a funny feeling
I'm going to have to leave your town
[Bridge]
Hmmm, hmmmm
Have mercy
Hmmmm, hmmmm
[Chorus]
Ah, you know I just been sitting here thinking
Wondering where in the world she been
