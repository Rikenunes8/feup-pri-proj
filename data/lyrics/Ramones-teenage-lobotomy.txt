[Intro]
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
[Chorus]
D.D.T. did a job on me
Now I am a real sickie
Guess I'll have to break the news
That I got no mind to lose
All the girls are in love with me
I'm a teenage lobotomy
[Verse]
Slugs and snails are after me
D.D.T. keeps me happy
Now I guess I'll have to tell 'em
That I got no cerebellum
Gonna get my Ph.D
I'm a teenage lobotomy
[Bridge]
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
[Chorus]
D.D.T. did a job on me
Now I am a real sickie
Guess I'll have to break the news
That I got no mind to lose
All the girls are in love with me
I'm a teenage lobotomy
