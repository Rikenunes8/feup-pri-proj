[Verse 1]
Oh, England my lionheart
I'm in your garden fading fast in your arms
The soldiers soften, the war is over
The air-raid shelters are blooming clover
Flappin' umbrellas fill the lanes
My London Bridge in rain again
[Verse 2]
Oh, England my lionheart
Peter Pan steals the kids in Kensington Park
You read me Shakespeare
 on 
the rolling Thames
That old river poet that never ever ends
Our thumpin' hearts hold the ravens in
Keep the tower from tumblin'
[Chorus]
Oh, England my lionheart
Oh, England my lionheart
Oh, England my lionheart
I don't want to go
[Verse 3]
Oh, England my lionheart
Dropped from my black Spitfire to my funeral barge
Give me one kiss in 
apple blossom
Give me one wish and I'd be wassailing
In the orchard my English rose
Or with my shepherd who'll bring me home
[Chorus]
Oh, England my lionheart
Oh, England my lionheart
Oh, England my lionheart
Oh, England my lionheart
Oh, England my lionheart
I don't want to go
