[Verse]
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so
In every way
I will hope you will guide me
And only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you
[Chorus]
I'm counting on you, dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through, dear
In your kind loving way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you'll know how completely
I'm counting on you
[Chorus]
I'm counting on you, dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through, dear
In your kind loving way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you'll know how completely
I'm counting on you
