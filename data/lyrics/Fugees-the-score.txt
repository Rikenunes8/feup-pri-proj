[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
(
Y-Y-You rockin' loud but you ain't sayin' nothin'
)
It's time I settle the score
(
I play my enemies like a game of chess
)
(
Playin' Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
)
(
Ha, ha, ha, ha, you shouldn't diss Refugees
)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)
[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Look to the rhyme (Rhyme), rum to the ripple (Ripple)
Single, but at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow, put the heater to your head
Now you dead
Wyclef don't give a ooh if you're dead
Rah, rah, let me attack just like a black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check your map
Ooh, you've gotta go for backup to do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
You put poison in my tea and kill the toad, but I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
A-hoo, a-hoo, a-hoo, I'm taking all crews, what?
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers, check your tooters as I'm suckin' on your girl hooters
Don't play macho 'cause you got the gun, son
'Cause if you gotta reload (Man)[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(
You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin'
)
It's time I settle the score
(
Too many emcees, not enough mics
)
(
Ready or not, here I come
)
(
Ha, ha, ha, ha, you shouldn't diss Refugees
)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)
[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, Wyclef the multi-talented, average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live, only if you want it (Only if you want it)
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's 
(Come on)
(
Check out my melody
)
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest, I'm victorious (Bing)
Still keep it real if you will, and manifest through your skills
Not by how many shells you peel
[Verse 3: Pras]
I'ma bring down the ruckus, play the nutcracker
Ruffneck rednecks, makes me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper (
Time after time
)
Boss, you don't want to fuck with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal?
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, floss like dental
I autograph my lyrics with a number two pencil[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(
You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin'
)
It's time I settle the score
(
Oba-observing the hypocrites
)
(
They smile in my face, then they talk behind my back
)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)
[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill & 
Wyclef
]
Yeah, I'm the L, won't you pull it? (
Pull it
)
Straight to the head with the speed of a bullet (
Bullet
)
Cuttin' niggas off at the meeky-freaky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers, I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria, aurora
To another galaxy, phallic see, be this microphone
But get lifted, lyrically, I'm gifted
Burn on it without the roach clip, it hinders, mind bender
Pleasure sender so frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully, you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke from the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See, even I feel the mahogany
L, natural hallucinogen turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams, release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(
You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin'
)
It's time I settle the score
(
Ready or not, Refugees taking over
)
(
'Cause we soft-spoken doesn't mean that we've forgotten
)
(
Now we're permanent at one
)
(
And one day you will be gotten
)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)
[Verse 5: Diamond D & 
Lauryn Hill
]
(Diamond D)
I creep like a thief, no doubt the man's swift (
Swift
)
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef (
Cleef
)
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
(
We know where to run
)
And start flakin' like dandruff (Come on)
Come on, son, my steelo's tight (
Uh-huh
)
'Cause by far, I'm the best producer on the mic (Right)
Born to write analytical conceptions
With precision, and leave lyrical incisions (Bing)
[Skit]
All J do is front and lie (Man, you crazy as hell)
Whatever, yo, I'm goin' to get something to drink
You alright? You straight? (Yeah, I'm straight)
I'll be right back
Ayo, LJ, I heard you fuckin' Michelle
Nigga, I been fuckin' Michelle
Michelle Leslie Brown? (
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown
)
From 225th Street?
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street
That play ball in the park?
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street that play ball in the park
Nigga, I been fuckin' her
What happened? What about her?
This nigga said he fucked Michelle (He said he fucked her)
There go Michelle right there, call her over, yo
Ayo, Michelle, come here for a second, baby (What?)
Come here (Ask her, ask her)
Ayo, you fucked J? (Hell no, ew, what?)
Nigga, not that Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street that play ball in the park
The other Michelle Leslie Brown
Nigga, that's the only one
Nigga, how many Michelle's is there?
Nigga, she got a cousin or some shit like that, man, I'm saying though
He's a frontin'-ass nigga on three
One, two, three
