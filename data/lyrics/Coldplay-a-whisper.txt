[Chorus]
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
[Post-Chorus]
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost
[Chorus]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
[Bridge]
Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers
[Chorus]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
[Post-Chorus]
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost
[Chorus]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
