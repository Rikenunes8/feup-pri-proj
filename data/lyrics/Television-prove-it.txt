[Verse 1]
The docks
The clock
A whisper woke him up
The smell of water would resume
The cave
The waves
Of light, the unreal night
The flat curving of a room
Get funny
[Chorus]
Prove it
Just the facts
Confidential
Ah, this case
This case
This case that I
I've been workin' on so long
So long
[Verse 2]
First you creep
Then you leap
Up about a hundred feet
You're in so deep that you could write a book
Chirp, chirp
The birds
They're giving you the words
A word's just a feeling you undertook
[Chorus]
Prove it
Just the facts
Confidential
Ah, this case
This case
This case that I
I've been workin' on so long
So long[Verse 3]
Now, the rose
How it slows
You in such colorless clothes
Fantastic! You lose your sense of human
Project
Protect
It's warm and it's calm and it's perfect
It's too "too too" to put a finger on
[Chorus]
Prove it
Just the facts
Confidential
Ah, this case
This case
This case that I
I've been workin' on so long
So long
[Outro]
This case is closed
