[Verse 1]
Tie yourself to me
No one else
No, you're not rid of me
Hmm, you're not rid of me
Night and day
I breathe, ah hah ay
Hey, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
[Verse 2]
I beg you, my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
I'll tie your legs
Keep you against my chest
Oh, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm going to twist your head off, see
[Chorus]
Till you say don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
[Verse 3]
I beg you my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
Big lonely above everything
Above everyday, I'm hurting
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm gonna twist your head off, see[Chorus]
Till you say don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs of desire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs of desire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs of desire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Lick my legs of desire
[Outro]
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
