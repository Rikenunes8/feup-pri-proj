Baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be?
Baby, baby, baby
Is it him or is it me?
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please you right?
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones, they hurt you every time
Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life
The vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always, every time
If I told you, baby
That I was in love with you
Oh, baby, baby, baby
If we got married
Would that be cool?
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones, you always seem to lose
Baby, baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be, baby?
Do you want him?
Or do you want me?
'Cause I want you
Say I want you
Tell me, baby
Do you want me?
I gotta know
I gotta know
Do you want me?
Can I tell you a story?
Sometimes you lose
Let me tell you
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes you win
Yes, you do
I say sometimes
Sometimes
I get so confused
Yes, I do
But I say right now
Right now
I know what I want
I want you
Baby, baby, baby
Listen to me
I may not know where I'm going, baby, woo!
Look here
I said, I may not know what I need
One thing
One thing's for certain, babyI know what I want, yeah
And it's to please you, baby
Please you, baby
I'm begging down on my knees
I want you
Yeah
I want you
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I want you, woo!
Yes, I do
