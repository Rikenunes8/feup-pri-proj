[Verse]
Have you ever been, have you ever been
To Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you, so don't you be late
Oh, (I want to show you) the different emotions
(I want to run to) the sounds and motions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride
We can cast all of your hang-ups over the seaside
While we fly right over the love-filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the loveland, soon you'll understand
[Bridge]
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
[Outro]
(I want to show you) The angels will spread their wings, spread their wings
(I want to show you) Good and evil lay side by side
While electric love penetrates the sky
(I want to show you) Lord, Lord Lord I want to show you
(I want to show you) Hmm, hmm, hmm
(I want to show you)
Show you
(I want to show you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
