[Verse 1]
I don't mind (I don't mind)
Your love
I don't mind (I don't mind)
The one you're thinking of
[Chorus]
But I know, I know
You gonna miss me
[Verse 2]
I don't mind (I don't mind)
Your lovesick soul
I don't mind your (I don't mind)
It can't grow cold
[Chorus]
But I know, I know
You gonna miss me
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Somewhere down the line
Mmm yeah
[Verse 3]
I don't mind (I don't mind)
This is all of my song
I don't mind (I don't mind)
Goodbye, so long[Chorus]
But I know, I know
You gonna miss me
[Outro]
Goodbye, so long
No, no, no I don't mind
Goodbye, so long
