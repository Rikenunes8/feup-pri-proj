[Verse 1: Sarah Jay Hawley]
Shame, such a shame
I think I kinda lost myself again
Day, yesterday
Really should be leaving, but I stay
[Verse 2: Sarah Jay Hawley]
Say, say my name
I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain
It's easy to remember when it came
[Chorus: Sarah Jay Hawley]
'Cause it feels like I've been
I've been here before
You're not my savior
But I still don't go
Feels like something
That I've done before
I could fake it
But I'd still want more
[Verse 3: Sarah Jay Hawley]
Fade, made to fade
Passion's overrated anyway
[Verse 4: Sarah Jay Hawley]
Say, say my name
I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain
It's easy to remember when it came
[Chorus: Sarah Jay Hawley]
'Cause it feels like I've been
I've been here before
Youâ€™re not my savior
But I still don't go, oh
I feel like something
That I've done before
I could fake it
But I'd still want more, oh
