Saw Johnny at the store
I said "Get your car, let's hit the road"
"Oh tell me baby, what's wrong?"
He said "Tell me baby, what's wrong?"
Do do do do....
She's on fire now
You think you wanna watch
(I think you'd better not)
Do you wanna get the wheel
Swerve my heart
It pounds with steel
"Oh tell me baby what's wrong?"
He said "Tell me baby what's wrong?"
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
Got my foot on the floor
We'll go 80, 95, maybe more
"Tell me baby what's wrong?"
He said "Tell me baby what's wrong?"
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
Hold me out, you're my girl
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
It's not what you want it's everything
