[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
Don't fake it, baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh-
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
(Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe)
('Lectric eye on me babe)
Put your ray gun to my head
(Put your ray gun to my head)
(Ray gun to my head)
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
(Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah)
(Freak out in a moonage daydream
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...)[Outro]
Freak out (Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out...)
Far out (Far out, far out, far out, far out...)
In out (In out, in out, in out, in out...)
