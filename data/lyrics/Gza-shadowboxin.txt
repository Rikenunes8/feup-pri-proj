[Intro: Method Man]
Special technique-
 (Nigga, fuck that)
Spe-special technique of shadowboxin'
 (Goddamn)
The GZA, uh, goddamn (Uh, the GZA)
Pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
 (Uh, goddamn, the Method, uh)
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop, allegiance to the hip-hop 
(Goddamn, Maximillion, Maximillion, uh)
Yeah, yeah (Uh)
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop (What?)
Maximillion, Maximillion, Maximillion
[Verse 1: Method Man]
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speakin' scud missile, heat-seekin'
Johnny Blazin', nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozin'
Slip the cardiac, arrest me
, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez
Burnin' to the third degree
Sneaky ass alley cat, top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya
[Interlude: Method Man]
Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
 (That's right, all you corny-ass rap motherfuckers)
The special technique of shadowboxing
 (Better go back and check your fucking stacks)
Because your naps ain't nappy enough (
Shadowboxing
)
And your reach ain't rugged enough, bitch[Verse 2: GZA]
Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session
[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now
Things are gettin' good, lookin' better now
...and some other shit[Outro]
Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special, special, special, special technique of shadowboxing
