[Intro]
Watch me
Watch me
I got it
Watch me

Hey
[Verse 1]
I got something that makes me wanna shout
I got something that tells me what it's all about
Huh, I got soul, and I'm super bad
[Chorus]
I've got soul, and I'm super bad
Huh
[Verse 2]
Now I got to move that tells me what to do
Sometimes it's easy, ha
Now I gotta move that tells me what to do
Sometimes I feel so nice, I wanna try myself with you
Ha, ha
[Chorus]
I got soul, and I'm super bad
Ha
[Verse 3]
I love, I love to do my thing
Ha, and I, and I don't need no one else
Sometimes I feels so nice, good god
I jump back, I wanna kiss myself
[Chorus]
I've got soul, huh, and I'm super bad
Hey
I said I'm super bad[Bridge]
Bridge, come on
Slap it down
And round and round
Up and down
All around
Right-on people
Huh, let it all hang out
If you don't brothers and sisters
Then you won't know
What it's all about
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Heeeeey
Uh, come on
[Verse 3]
I got the something that makes me wanna shout
I got that thing that tells me what it's all about
I got soul, ha, and I'm super bad
I got the move that tells me what to do
Sometimes I feel so nice, I said I wanna try myself with you
Ha
[Chorus]
I, I, I, I
I got soul, and I'm super bad[Bridge]
Bridge, hit me
Slap it down
And all around
Right-on people
Huh, let it all hang out
If you don't brothas and sistas
Then you won't know
What it's all about
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
