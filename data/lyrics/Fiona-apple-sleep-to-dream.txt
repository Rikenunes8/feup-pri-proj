[Verse 1]
I tell you how I feel, but you don't care
I say tell me the truth, but you don't dare
You say love is a hell you cannot bear
And I say "Give me mine back and then go there
For all I care"
[Chorus]
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my 
own hell to raise
[Verse 2]
I have never been so insulted in all my life
I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride
First you run like a fool just to be at my side
And now you run like a fool but you just run to hide
And I can't abide
[Chorus]
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my 
own hell to raise
[Bridge]
Don't make it a big deal, don't be so sensitive
We're not playing a game anymore
You don't have to be so defensive
[Verse 3]
Don't you plead me your case, don't bother to explain
Don't even show me your face, cause it's a crying shame
Just go back to the rock from under which you came
Take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim
And don't forget the blame[Chorus]
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my 
own hell to raise
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my 
own hell to raise
