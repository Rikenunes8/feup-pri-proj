[Verse 1]
She had to leave Los Angeles
All her toys wore out in black and her boys had too
She started to hate every 
nigge‚Äçr
 and Jew
Every 
Mexican that gave her a lotta shit
Every homosexual and the idle rich
[Chorus]
She had to get out (Get out)
Get out (Get out)
Get out (Get out)
[Refrain]
She gets confused
Flying over the date-line
Her hands turn red
'Cause the days change at night
Change in an instant
The days change at night
Change in an instant
[Verse 2]
She had to leave Los Angeles
She found it hard to say goodbye to her own best friend
She bought a Glock on Hollywood Boulevard the day she left
It felt sad
It felt sad
It felt sad
[Chorus]
She had to get out (Get out)
Get out (Get out)
Get out (Get out)
[Refrain]
She gets confused
Flying over the date-line
Her hands turn red
'Cause the days change at night
Change in an instant
The days change at night
Change in an instant
The days change at night
Change in an instant
