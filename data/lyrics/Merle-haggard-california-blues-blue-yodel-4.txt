Well I'm goin' to California
Where they sleep out every night
I'm goin' to California
Where they sleep out every night
I'm leaving you, mama
'Cause you know you don't treat me right
Let me tell you somethin'
Mama, that you don't know
Let me tell you somethin'
Good gal, that you don't know
Well, I'm a do right papa
And got a home everywhere I go
Yeah
I got the California blues and I'm
Sure gonna leave you here
Lord, Lord
I got the California blues and I'm
Sure gonna leave you here
I may ride the blind
I ain't got no railroad fare
Listen to me, mama
While I sing this song
Listen to your daddy
Sing you this lonesome song
You got me wearied now
But I won't be wearied long
I got the California blues and I'm
Sure gonna leave you here
Hey, hey, hey
I got the California blues and I'm
Sure gonna leave you here
I may ride the blind
I ain't got no railroad fare
