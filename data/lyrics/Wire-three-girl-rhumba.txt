Think of a number, divide it by two
Something is nothing, nothing is nothing
Open a box, tear off the lid
Then think of a number, don't think of an answer
Open your eyes, think of a number
Don't get swept under, a number's a number
A chance encounter you want to avoid
The inevitable
So you do, oh yes, you do
The impossible
Now you ain't got a number, you just wanna rhumba
And there ain't no way you're gonna go under
Go under, go under, go under, go under
You tear me asunder, go under, go under
Go under, yeah
