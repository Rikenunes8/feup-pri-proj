As I was lyin in a hospital bed
A rock n roll nurse went into my head
She says, hold ya arm, stick out ya tongue
I gots some pills I'm gonna give you somes
She went into my head, into my head
A rock n roll nurse, went into my head
Into my head, into my head
While I was lyin in a hospital bed
A little pill for my legs, but that didn't ache
I tried some pills for my heart, but a little to late
Gots some pills for my love, to put me at ease
Ats when a rock n roll nurse shook me down to my knees
She went into my head, shoved into my head
A rock n roll nurse went into my head
Into my head, into my head
As I was lyin in a hospital bed
(I got the rock n roll nurse...)
Nursey nursey, I dont see
Well I don't understand what your doin to me
Said ya give me th pills, then ya give me the shot
Got me wonderin what is worse I gotShe went into my head, shoved into my head
A rock n roll nurse went into my head
Into my head, into my head
As I was lyin in a hospital bed
(I got the rock n roll nurse
She's a makin it worse
Keep shootin it right
To my head...)
Doctor doctor! Run here and see
I dont think th job the nurse is givin me
Gives me the shots, gives me th pills
Got me takin this junk, against my wills
She went into my head, shoved into my head
A rock n roll nurse went into my head
Into my head, into my head
As I was lyin in a hospital bed
