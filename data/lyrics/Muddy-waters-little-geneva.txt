[Verse 1]
I was standing in my kitchen
Looking way out across the field
Yes, I was standing in my kitchen
Looking way out across the field
I thought I heard, I thought I heard
My little Geneva call me
[Verse 2]
Well I was standing at my window
Watching the rain begin to fall
Yes, I was standing at my window
Watching the rain begin to fall
I want to see Geneva so bad this morning
Man, she heals my all in all
Alright, Geneva
[Verse 3]
Yes, I was standing in my door
Watching the sun go behind a tree
Yes, I was standing in my door
Watching the sun go behind a tree
I want to see Geneva so bad, so bad
Right now I'm on my bended knee
