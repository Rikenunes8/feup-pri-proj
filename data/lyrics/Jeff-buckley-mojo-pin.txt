[Verse 1]
I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole
[Verse 2]
Oh, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
To keep me satisfied
[Chorus]
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, 
the white horses flow
Memories fire, 
the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
[Verse 3]
Oh, precious precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve
And pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless
And I'm there in your arms
[Chorus]
Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, 
the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
So, so, so, so
[Verse 4]
Oh the welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for[Chorus]
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, 
the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
So, Black Black Black Beauty
