When we're all in the crowd and you catch her eye
And then you both smile, I feel so good inside
And when I'm with her she talks about you, the things that you say, the things that you do
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
They are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)
They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)
And they've got something (Liz and Brian)
It's so hard to find (Joy and Davey)
They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)
They are friends of mine (June and Duffy)
And they've got something (Jean and Jim)
You don't often find (and Jim and Christie)
And she takes your hand when the world stays outside
That's something to see, that's nothing to hide
And when I feel bad when people disappoint me
That's when I need you two to help me believe
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
They are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)
They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)
And they've got something (Liz and Brian)
It's so hard to find (Joy and Davey)
They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)
They are friends of mine (June and Duffy)
And they've got something (Jean and Jim)
You don't often find (and Jim and Christie)It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
