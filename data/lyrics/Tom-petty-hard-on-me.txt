[Verse 1]
It's all I can do to keep that little girl smiling
And keep my faith alive
Takes all I got to hold on to tomorrow
And you want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me
[Verse 2]
Some other time, I'd be understanding
You were supposed to be
The friend that I needed when I was down
And now you want to make it hard
Yeah, you want to make it hard on me
[Chorus]
Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be?
[Refrain]
You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me
[Chorus]
Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be?
[Verse 3]
I need someone to put their arm around me
Shelter me from all harm
Just as I find something to believe in
You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me
[Refrain]
Yeah, you want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me
