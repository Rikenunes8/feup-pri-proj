[Verse 1]
I can't write
And I can't sing
I can't do anything
[Verse 2]
I can't read
And I can't spell
I can't even get to hell
[Verse 3]
I can't luv
And I can't hate
I can't even hesitate
[Verse 4]
I can't dance
And I can't walk
I can't even try to talk
[Chorus]
Freddy tried to strangle me
With my plastic popper beads
But I hit him back
With my pet rat
Yeah I hit him back
With my pet rat
[Verse 5]
I can't spit
And I can't kick
I can't even be thick
[Verse 2]
I can't read
And I can't spell
I can't even get to hell
[Verse 3]
I can't love
And I can't hate
I can't even hesitate[Verse 4]
I can't dance
And I can't walk
I can't even try to talk
[Chorus]
Freddy tried to strangle me
With my plastic popper beads
But I hit him back
With my pet rat
Yeah I hit him back
With my pet rat
Yeah I hit him back
With my pet rat
Yeah I - hit him - back
With my - pet rat
