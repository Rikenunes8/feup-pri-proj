[Verse 1]
I let the beast in too soon
I don't know how to live without my hand on his throat
I fight him always and still
Oh darling, it's so sweet
You think you know how crazy
How crazy I am
You say you don't spook easy
You won't go
But I know
And I pray that you will
[Chorus]
Fast as you can, baby
Run, free yourself of me
Fast as you can
[Verse 2]
I may be soft in your palm
But I'll soon grow hungry for a fight
And I will not let you win
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases
That will disprove your faith in man
So if you catch me trying to find my way into your heart
From under your skin
[Chorus]
Fast as you can, baby
Scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can
Fast as you can, baby
Scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can
[Bridge]
Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift
But most of the time, it does
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift
Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was
And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift
And you give me some more of your drugs
Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift
Cause I'm tired of whys, choking on whys
Just need a little because, because[Verse 3]
I let the beast in and then
I even tried forgiving him, but it's too soon
So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again
And for a little while more
I'll soar the uneven wind, complain and blame the sterile land
But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear
I'm blooming within
[Chorus]
Fast as you can, baby, wait, watch me; I'll be out
Fast as I can, maybe late but at least about
Fast as you can, leave me, let this thing run its route
[Outro]
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
