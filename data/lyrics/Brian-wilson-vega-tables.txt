- The Elements: Earth -
[Chorus]
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table
[Verse 1]
If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot
[Chorus]
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and
 sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table
[Verse 2]
I tried to kick the ball but my 
tenny
 flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarassed
[Hook]
Sleep a lot eat a lot brush em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot eat a lot brush em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy (boy)
(Wordless Vocals)
[Verse 3]
I throw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter (pa, pa, pa, pa, du-du-du, du-du-du!)
[End Part]
I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table
