There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Babe, sing with me somehow

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, can you hear me now?
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, sing with me somehow

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless

Thank you
While we were in Washington
Last week
We stayed at the Mayflower Hotel
Which is the hotel where all the southern senators stay
I was hoping that I could, uh
Find George Wallace and sing this little tune for him
