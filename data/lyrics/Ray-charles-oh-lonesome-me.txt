[Verse 1]
Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me
[Verse 2]
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging 'round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me
[Chorus]
I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and, people, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
[Verse 3]
Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me
[Chorus]
I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and, people, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms[Verse 4]
Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to
Oh, lonesome me
[Outro]
Uh-huh, lonesome me
Oh, oh, oh, lonesome me
Yeah, lonesome me
Uh-huh, lonesome me
