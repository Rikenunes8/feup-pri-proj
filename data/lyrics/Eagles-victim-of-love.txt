[Verse 1]
What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot
[Verse 2]
I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?
[Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well
[Verse 3]
Some people never come clean
Oh, I think you know what I mean, oh
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between
[Verse 4]
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
A-this ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends, your been-around-the-world friends
That talk is for losers and fools
[Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?
[Guitar Solo][Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
What kind of love have you got?
[Outro]
Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
