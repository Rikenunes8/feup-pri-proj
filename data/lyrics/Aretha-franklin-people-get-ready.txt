[Intro]
I believe
I believe
I believe
I do believe
[Chorus]
People get ready, there's a train coming (Ooh ooh)
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All we need is faith to hear the diesels humming
You don't need no ticket, we'll just thank the Lord
(Thank the Lord, ooh ooh)
[Verse 1]
People get ready, for the train to Jordan (Ooh ooh)
It's picking up passengers from coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's hope for all among His loved the most
[Refrain]
I believe
I believe
I believe
I do believe
[Verse 2]
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner (Sinner)
Whom would hurt all mankind just to save his own, believe me
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there is no hiding place against the kingdom's throne
There is no hiding place against the kingdom's throne
(Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
[Chorus]
So people get ready, there's a train coming (Ooh ooh)
You don't need no ticket, we'll just get on board
All you need is faith, yeah, to hear those diesels humming
You don't need no baggage, you just, we'll just thank the Lord[Outro]
Oh, we'll just thank the Lord
Thank the Lord
Thank the Lord (Come on, get on board)
I'll tell you we don't need no ticket, we'll just
We'll just thank the Lord
I say, we'll just thank the Lord
Oh, thank you, Lord
Thank the Lord (Come on, get on board)
Oh, thank you because I'm living
(Come on, get on board)
I thank You today because I need You to be there
(Come on, get on board)
