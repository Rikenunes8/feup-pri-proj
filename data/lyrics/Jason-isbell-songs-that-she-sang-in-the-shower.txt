On a lark, on a whim
I said, "there's two kinds of men in this world and you're neither of them."
And his fist cut the smoke
I had an eighth of a second to wonder if he got the joke
And in the car, headed home
She asked if I had considered the prospect of living alone
With a steak held to my eye
I had to summon the confidence needed to hear her goodbye
And another brief chapter without any answers blew bye
And the songs that she sang in the shower are stuck in my head
Like 
"Bring Out Your Dead"
, 
"Breakfast In Bed"
And experience robs me of hope that she'll make it back home
So I'm stuck on my own
Oh, I'm stuck on my own
In the room by myself
Looks like I'm here with a guy that I judge worse than anyone else
So I pace and I pray
And I repeat the mantras that might keep me clean for the day
And the songs that she sang in the shower all ring in my ears
Like "
Wish You Were Here
"
How I wish you were here
And experience robs me of hope that you'll ever return
So I breathe and I burn
I breathe and I burn
And the church bells are ringing for those who are easy to please
And the frost on the ground probably envies the frost on the trees
And the songs that she sang in the shower are stuck in my mind
Like "
Yesterday's Wine
"
Like "Yesterday's Wine"
And experience tells me that I'll never hear them again
Without thinking of then
Without thinking of then
