[Intro]
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jukebox life, Diamond nights and 
ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls
[Verse 1]
Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
[Pre-Chorus]
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start
[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
[Post-Chorus]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western 
male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale
[Verse 2]
Face-to-face, each classic case
We shadow box and double-cross
Yet need the chase
[Pre-Chorus]
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels; his heart is cold[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
[Post-Chorus]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale
[Outro]
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
