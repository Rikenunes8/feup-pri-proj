[Verse 1]
I take the bus to town
Sittin' in the back and talk to no one
I got the high heels on
I go out dancing all by my own
People are pushing by
Somebody always tries to cut in line
Soon as I get inside
I lose myself in the blinding lights
[Chorus]
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
[Verse 2]
I got them hypnotized
I get another shout out on the mic
Peep me out all you like
I came to dance, not to socialize
Riddim goes boom, boom, boom
Sleng teng
 drops with theâ€”
People, all gather round
Rocking to the beat, the queen will be crowned
[Chorus]
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
[Bridge]
I go down low like shiwow
Shiwow-wow-wow
Wind my hips real slow like shiwow
Shiwow-wow-wow
I go down low like shiwow
Shiwow-wow-wow
Wind my hips real slow like shiwow
Shiwow-wow-wow[Chorus]
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
Now what? Your jaw has dropped
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
