[Verse 1]
I want to be a platinum blonde
Just like all the sexy stars
Marilyn and Jean, Jayne, Mae and Marlene
Yeah they, they really had fun
In a luminous Day-Glo shade
Walk into a bar and I will have it made
Because if that is all it takes; a double processed blonde
I want to be a platinum blonde
I want to be a platinum blonde
Be a platinum blonde
[Verse 2]
Yeah I even tried wearing a wig for a while
It was the right color, but not the right style
Going to get some peroxide at the beauty supply
See you later
[Verse 3]
I want to be a platinum blonde
Just like all the sexy stars
Marilyn and Jean, Jayne, Mae and Marlene
Yeah they, they really had fun
[Verse 4]
Now if you need me on Sunday and you look twice and see
That platinum blonde is going to be me
In a double processed luminous Day-Glo shade
When I get this color I will have it made in the shade
Oh, I hope I am OK
I want to be a platinum blonde
I want to be a platinum blonde
[Outro]
Honey, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to
I got to be a platinum blonde
I got to be a platinum blonde
I got to be a platinum blonde
I will hit the bottle baby
