[Verse 1]
It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay
10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standin' by the bar, hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
[Chorus]
I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified for a one-night stand
But I could never take the place of your man"
[Verse 2]
It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes
(Tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way, yeah
She couldn't stop cryin' 'cause she knew he was gone to stay
, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, "Oh, honey baby, that's a dead end
You know and I kno
w that we wouldn't be satisfied, no"
[Chorus]
And I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
Wouldn't be satisfied with a one-night stand
And I could never take the place of your man"
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
One, two, one, two, woo
Ahh
