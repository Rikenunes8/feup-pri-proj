Downtown's been caught by the hysteria
The people scream and shout
A generation's on the move
When disco spreads like a bacteria
The lonely days are out
Welcome the passion of the groove

The golden years, the silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I wanna get down, you spin me around
I stand on the borderline
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque

Tonight's the night at danceteria
The joining of the tribe
The speakers pumping clear and loud
The way you move is our criteria
Let the DJ takes you high
And tears of joy baptise the crowd

The golden years, the silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I wanna get down, you spin me around
I stand on the borderline

Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque

The golden years, the silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I wanna get down, you spin me around
I stand on the borderline

Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque, the discoteque, the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque
