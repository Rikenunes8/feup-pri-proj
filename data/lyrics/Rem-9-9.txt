[Intro]
Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reinforced
Now what does that mean?
Is there a just contradiction? Nothing much
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord to hesitate
[Verse 1]
Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Got a stripe
Down his back
All nine yards
Down her back
[Chorus]
Give me a couple
Don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation fear
[Verse 2]
Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Got a stripe
Down his back
All nine yards
Down her back
[Chorus]
Give me a couple
Don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation
What is in my mind?
What is in my mind?
What is in my mind?

Hesitate[Verse 3]
Got to punch
Right on target
Twist his tongue
He's got a stripe
Down her back
All nine yards
Down his back
[Chorus]
Give me a couple
Don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation fear
[Outro]
Conversation fear
Conversation fear
Conversation fear
