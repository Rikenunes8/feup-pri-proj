[Verse 1]
Now 
Smackwater Jack
 he bought a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood for a little confrontation
He just let it all hang loose
He didn't think about the noose
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation
[Chorus]
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand
Shotgun
[Verse 2]
Now Big Jim the Chief stood for law and order
He called for the guard to come and surround the border
Now from his bulldog mouth
As he led the posse south
Came the cry, "We got to ride to clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters"
[Chorus]
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand
No, no, no, no, no, no
[Verse 3]
The account of the capture wasn't in the papers
But you know, they hanged ole Smack right then instead of later
You know the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker
[Chorus]
You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand
A shotgun in his hand[Outro]
Smackwater Jack, yeah
Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Yeah, Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Oh, Smackwater Jack, yeah
Smackwater Jack, yeah
Talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack, yeah
Ooh, had a shotgun
Talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack, oh
Talkin' 'bout Jack and his shotgun
Talkin' 'bout Smack, talkin' about Jack
Smackwater Jack, yeah
