[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind of love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes
[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
[Verse 2]
I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high
[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
[Bridge]
I knew it as soon as I felt it
Mm-mm, I knew it as soon as I felt it
Yeah
[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby, yeah
