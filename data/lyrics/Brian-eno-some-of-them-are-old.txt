[Verse 1]
People come and go and forget to close the door
And leave their stains and cigarette butts trampled on the floor
And when they do
Remember me, remember me
[Verse 2]
Some of them are old, some of them are new
Some of them will turn up when you least expect them to
And when they do
Remember me, remember me
[Verse 3]
Lucy you're my girl, Lucy you're a star
Lucy please be still and hide your madness in a jar
But do beware
It will follow you, it will follow you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Some of them are old but it would help if you could smile
To earn a crooked sixpence you'll walk many crooked miles
And as you do
Remember me, remember me
[Outro]
Doo-roo doo-roo, roo-roo
Doo-roo-roo-roo
Doo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo
Roo-roo-roo-roo
Remember me, remember me
