[Verse 1]
It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you
[Verse 2]
So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you
[Chorus 1]
Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes (In your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes)
[Verse 3]
Though we had our fling (We had our fling)
I just never would suspect a thing (Suspect a thing)
'Til that little bell began to ring (Began to ring)
In my head, in my head
[Verse 4]
But I tried to run (I tried to run)
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none (Not help me none)
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said
[Chorus 2]
But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light
In your eyes (In your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes)[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5]
But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes
[Chorus 3]
And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes (In my eyes)
[Outro]
In my eyes (In my eyes)
In my eyes (In my eyes)
In my eyes (In my eyes)
In my eyes (In my eyes)
