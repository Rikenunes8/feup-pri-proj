Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Well the way I used to love you baby
Baby that's the way I hate you now
You used to say that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
You used to say that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
Well I don't blame you baby
Because you ain't what you used to be
Let me love you just one more time
Yes let me love you just one more time anyway
Oh, let me love you, let me love you, let me love you
One more time baby
Let me love you just one more time anyway
Oh you can't quit me now baby
Because you didn't mean me no good anyway
Well you know where I'm from baby
So please don't try to mistreat me
Yes you know where I'm from baby
So please don't try to mistreat me
Yes because I'll make your mother a present
Baby of you and your casket too
Oh you once said you loved me
And you would do anything I said
Oh you once said you loved me baby
And you would do anything I said
Oh but the way you treat me now baby
I just soon rather be dead
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
The way I used to love you
Baby that's the way I hate you now
