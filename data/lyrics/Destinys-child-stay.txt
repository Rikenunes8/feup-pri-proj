[Intro: Beyoncé]
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Baby, I want for nothing
Just your tender sweet loving
I know you've got your things to do
But tell me what means more to you
Hangin' out with me or with your boys?
Sometimes, I do get lonely
With no 'you' and no one to hold me
You want so much to lay me down
Is that what keeps you hangin' around
Is that the only way to win your heart?
[Chorus]
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'll be, be yours forever
But can we keep us together?
I know the time is drawing near
I've promised you, has it been a year?
Baby, now I'm ready
Will you stay? Stay
[Chorus]
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay (Baby, oh)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Every night I lay and think about it
If you love me, you could live without it
But I don't wanna do you that way
No no, no no no, no
I don't know exactly what I'm feelin'
I'm kinda scared but then I'm kinda willin'
Will you promise me just one thing? (Thing, oh no)
No matter what you're gonna stay[Chorus]
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes (Stay, stay)
Give you more than touches and kisses (Stay, stay)
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay (Stay, stay, stay)
If I loved you a little bit longer (Stay, please stay)
If my love was a little bit stronger (Stay, please stay)
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay (Stay, stay, stay)
