[Verse 1]
I want him, and I need him
And someday, some way, woah, oh, oh, I'll meet him
He'll be kind of shy, real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do
[Chorus]
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love
[Verse 2]
When he's near me, I'll kiss him
And when he leaves me, woah, oh, oh, I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care
And I'll know it's gonna be alright 'cause we've got so much we share
[Chorus]
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love
[Bridge]
(Johnny) No, no he'll never do
(Bobby) No, it isn't him too
They would never, no they'd never
Never, Ever, ever know
[Chorus]
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love
[Outro (Fade)]
Oh, oh
Where can he be?
Oh, oh
I've been wishing, hopin', that he'll come to me...
