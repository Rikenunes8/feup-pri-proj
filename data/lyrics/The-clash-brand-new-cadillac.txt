My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes, she did
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
She said, "Hey, come here, Daddy!"
"I ain't never comin' back!"

Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
C'mon, sugar, just come on back to me
She said, "
Balls to you

Big Daddy

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Oh, c'mon, just hear my plea
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy"
She ain't comin' back to me
[Chorus]
Baby, baby drove up in a Cadillac
I said, "Jesus Christ! Where'd ya' get that Cadillac?"
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy"
She ain't never coming back!
She ain't never coming back!
She ain't never coming back!
She ain't never coming back!
