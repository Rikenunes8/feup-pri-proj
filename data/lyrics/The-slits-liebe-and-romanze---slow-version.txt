Babylon love us
Oh, Babylon love us
Oh, oh, oh, sweet love und romance
Ain't it something? Man, let's dance
Want you with me all the time
You promised angel that you're mine
(She wants you, she wants you)
I own you
See you later, alligator
(She wants you, she wants you)
In a while crocodile
I'm so happy
You're so nice
Kiss, kiss, kiss
Fun, fun life
I'm so glad that you belong to me
Oh my darling, who wants to be free?
Together we can reach the stars
Oh yeah, baby, we'll go far
(She wants you, she wants you)
Spread your wings and let me come inside
(She wants you, she wants you)
In a while crocodile
I'm so happy
You're so nice
Kiss, kiss, kiss
Fun, fun life
Oh, oh, oh, sweet love und romance
I'm so glad we met by chance
Call you everyday on the telephone
Break your neck if you ain't home
We can get married and have a house in the country
Love's a feeling and so is stealing
Do ya hear me? I hear ya
I'm so happy
You're so nice
Kiss, kiss, kiss
Fun, fun life
Fun, fun, fun, I'm having fun
It's such a love
Now we're one
Life's a gas all the time
You're so lovely, you're so fine
(She wants you, she wants you)
(She wants you, she wants you)
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this?
Gimme a great big kiss
I'm so happy
You're so nice
Kiss, kiss, kiss
Fun, fun life
Life, life, life, life
