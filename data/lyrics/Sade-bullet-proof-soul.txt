[Verse 1]
I was so in love with you
You rarely see a love that true
Wasn't that enough for you?
Wasn't that enough for you?
I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all
[Hook]
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
[Bridge]
Hit me like a slow bullet
Like a slow bullet
Took me some time to realize it
[Hook 2]
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
I know the end before
The story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
I know the end before
The story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul[Verse 2]
You were trigger happy, baby
You never warned me, let me free
It's not that complicated
But you're going to need a bullet proof soul
Think you got it but you got all the trouble you need
I came in like a lamb
But I intend to leave like a lion
[Outro]
It hit me like a slow bullet
It hit me like a slow bullet
