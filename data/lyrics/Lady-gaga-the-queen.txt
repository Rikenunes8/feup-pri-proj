[Verse 1]
Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say "hello"
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Woah, woah
[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life
[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
[Verse 2]
I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Woah, woah
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum
[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life
[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
The que ee-ee-ee-ee ee-ee-eeen
The queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen[Bridge]
Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore
[Outro]
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
