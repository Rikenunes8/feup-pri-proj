[Intro: Scott La Rock & 
KRS-One
]
Yo, Kris
I really knocked the boots on those two big-butt females last night
Jeez
Yeah, man
On my way down to 
Latin Quarter
 to find two more freaks
Word
Super sperm
[Chorus]
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
[Post-Chorus]
Super sperm
[Verse 1]
Scott La Rock is, for now, the main topic
Not looking at his cuts
 
or cash flow of the pocket
You may not realize it or you may not know
But, uh, 
he is a super ho
When I say super, I'm not exaggeratin'
Datin' for a guy like Scott turns into matin'
He seems to be quiet, but I don't buy it
Proof is in the puddin', why don't you just try it?
The super ho is loose in your section
And he's armed with a powerful erection
So grab your girl and run for protection
Your mama too, 'cause I'd like to mention
[Chorus]
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
[Post-Chorus]
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm[Verse 2]
Whatever you could do or say inside a bed
Scott La Rock has done it most likely, said
He doesn't argue with a girl 'cause, yes, he has others
Keep updated on all kind of rubbers
Got ones that are lambskin, others that are plastic
One day he'll open a school for prophylactics
They don't know
He is a super ho
Up in Rochester, on DKX
WDKX, now DK-Sex
We were bein' interviewed there live on air
Every girl in the city, Scott had an affair
KM in the AM had asked his last question
But Scott La Rock said, "Wait, I gotta mention
The fact that I'm single, I like to mingle"
And one more time, bust the fresh jingle
[Chorus]
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
[Post-Chorus]
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm[Verse 3]
In the field of music I'll always pass by
Girls that claim to act so fly
They always act like it's all about them or their friends
But according to Scott, they all like to bend
Yes, fly girls
, 
shy girls
, Black girls, white girls
In '87, it's got to be the right girl
If you claim to have a little problem
Well, Scott La Rock knows just how to solve 'em
If you're a guy, a nine'll do the trick
But if you're a girl, you need someâ€” 
flowers
I admit Scott has strange powers
Enticing girls in less than a hour
Or should I say minutes? I seen how he did it
He probably says "I'm Scott La Rock" and she's with it
So whether he's a gigolo, tramp, or pro
He is a super ho
Now many people have their ways of expressin'
What they do best, for Scott, it's undressin'
Yes, either a girl or some date for the night
He doesn't want to hear that you're too tight
So do not think that Scott La Rock is mean
It's not his fault, he'll give you Vaseline
The super ho is loose in your area
Makin' life for girls a little scarier
So if you got a radio tryin' to tape this
Do not keep in mind that he is a rapist
For the super ho to be chillin'
Another female out there has to be willin'
So all you tramps and hoes raise your hand
'Cause super ho Scott La Rock understands
If you're a guy, we'll talk about hangin'
And if you're a girl, he'll talk about bangin'
If your moms call up, well, I don't know
But, uh, 
he is a super ho
[Chorus]
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
[Post-Chorus]
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
Super sperm
[Outro]
Scott La Rock had 'em all
He is a super ho
