[Verse 1]
I guess I just must be a daredevil
I don't feel anything until I smash it up
I'm caught on the cold, I'm caught on the hot, not so with the warmer lot
And all I want's a confidante to help me laugh it off
[Chorus]
And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone
[Verse 2]
Say I'm an airplane and the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing, and I use them to give me a lift
Hip hip for the lift
, 
hip hip for the drag
, 
I want them all in my bag
Oh, give me anything, and I'll turn it into a gift
[Chorus]
But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone
[Bridge]
Seek me out, look at, look at, look at
Look at me, I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up, 
give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night[Verse 3]
Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you and never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay
, 
skirtin' the skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms
[Chorus]
But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone
