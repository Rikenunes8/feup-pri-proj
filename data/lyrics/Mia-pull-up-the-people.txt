Yeah, we got God now we got you
Every day thinking 'bout how we get through
Everything I own is on IOU
But I'm here bringing you something new
You no like the people, they no like you
Then they gonna set it off with a big boom
Son in a battle, is a son and battle too
Why you wanna talk about who done who?
Why you wanna talk about—

You treat me like a killer
