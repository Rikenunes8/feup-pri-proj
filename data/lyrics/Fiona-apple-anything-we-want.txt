[Verse 1]
My cheeks were reflecting the longest wavelength
My fan was folded up and grazing my forehead
And I kept touching my neck to guide your eye to where
I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone
[Verse 2]
My scars were reflecting the mist in your headlights
I look like a neon zebra shaking rain off her stripes
And the rivulets had you riveted to the places that
I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone
[Chorus]
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
[Bridge]
Started out sippin' the water
And now we try to swallow the wave
And we try not to let those bastards get us down
We don't worry anymore
'Cause we know when the guff comes we get brave
After all, look around, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening now
[Verse 3]
Let's pretend we're eight years old playin' hooky
I draw on the wall and you can play UFC rookie
Then we'll grow up, take our clothes off and you remind me that
I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone
[Chorus]
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
