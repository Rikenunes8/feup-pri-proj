[Part I]
[Chorus]
My eyes are green
'Cause I eat a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
My eyes are green
'Cause I eat a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
[Verse 1]
I don't care, I swear
I'm too through with you, I am
You don't mean nothing to me
So go ahead and be with your friend
[Chorus]
My eyes are green
'Cause I eats a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
[Part II]
[Intro]
I'm insecure
But I can't help it
My mind says move on
My heart lags behind
But I don't love you any more
I'm so insecure
Never knew that love did this
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't remember the last time I felt this way
About somebody
You've done something to my mind
And I can't control it
But I don't love you any more
Yes, I do, I think
Loving you is wrong
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oohLa-di-da
Dum-dee-da-da
Dum-didi-da-di-da-di-da
Dum-didi-da-di-dum-di
I'm so confused
You tried to trick me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never knew that love could hurt like this
Never thought I would, but I got dissed
Makes me feel so sad and hurt inside
Feel embarrassed so I want to hide
Silly me—I thought your love was true
Change my name to Silly E. Badu
Before I heal, it's gonna be a while
I know it's gonna be a while, chil'
[*ad-libs*]
I hope it's not too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too—
Feeling insecure
Love has got me sore
I don't want no moreOh, oh
It's too late, oh, oh ooh, ooh
I'm sorry I love you
At first, it was cool
You told me you loved me, too, ooh
And then you lost your love
Oh, then you lost your love
And then you lost your love
You wanted me to go away
But I can't go
See, I can't leave, it's too late
I can't leave, it's too late
I can't leave, it's too late
I can't leave, it's too late
Just make love to me
Just one more time and then you'll see
I can't believe I made a desperate plea
What's with me? Me? Me, yeah, ye-ah, no, oh
You see I can't leave, it's too late
I can't leave, it's too late
Don't you know, I can't leave, it's too late
Can't go nowhere, no
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late, yeah
Come on, babe
Don't you wanna be strong with me?
You told me we could have a family
Wanna run to mama when you're down and low
But times get tough, and there you go
Ooh, out the door, you wanna run again
Open the arms and you'll come back in
Wanna run 'cause you say that you were afraid, afraid, oh
Never knew what a friendship was
Never knew how to really love
You can't be what I need you to
And I don't know why I fuck with you
I know our love will never be the same
But I can't stand these growing pains
