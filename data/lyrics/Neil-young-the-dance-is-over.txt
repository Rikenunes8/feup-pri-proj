When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

I can love, I can really love, I can really love
I can love, I can really love, I can really love
Like a mountain that's growing, a river that rolls
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love
When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love
