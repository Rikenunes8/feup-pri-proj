[Verse]
All Aboard!
Mean old Frisco, take my babe away
All Aboard!
Mean old Frisco, take my babe away
I've been hoping, I've been trusting
My baby come back home one day
Well, that people
Just don't understand
One day people
Just don't understand
Well, now to take my woman away
Give her to another man
I stand here tremblin'
While the train goes around the bend
Standin' here a-tremblin'
While the train goes around the bend
Well, I've started into cryin'
People I don't have no friends
Welcome there new love
Round all, tearin' me down
Welcome there new love
Round all, tearin' me down
Well, I worked hard all of my life
Now I'm getting pushed around
