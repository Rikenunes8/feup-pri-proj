[Verse 1]
I hear your winter
And I hear your rain
And I've failed your summer ways
And I feel no pain
[Chorus]
I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
I hear you fade away
And I hear you crawl
And I gave my life away
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel your pain
[Verse 3]
And she was my lover, so sweet
And she was my angel
And what I've recovered of me
I put into a box underneath my bed
[Verse 4]
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
Lie
Lie
[Bridge]
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head[Chorus]
I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way
[Outro]
