[Verse 1]
He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity
He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity
[Chorus 1]
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
[Verse 2]
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion, atrocities done in his name
[Chorus 2]
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
Your God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
[Bridge]
Burning with your god in humility
Will you die for this?
Will you die for this?
Will you die for this?
Will you die for this?[Chorus 3]
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
(Your god is dead)
God is dead
(And no one cares)
And no one cares
(Drowning in his own hypocrisy)
If there is a hell I'll see you there
(Shout it out)
