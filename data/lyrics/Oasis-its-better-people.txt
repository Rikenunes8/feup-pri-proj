[Verse 1]
It's better people love one another
'Cause living your life can be tough
It's better people speak to each other
Your shame is not enough
If everybody came alive
And stayed alive
And lived their lives instead, yeah
So come outside
And feel the light
It's cold inside
But it's lonely in your bed
In your bed
[Chorus 1]
And you thought we might be
But what you heard before
Was only sleeping in your brain
But if you came with me
The days would never end
Would never be the same
Would never be the same
Would never be the same
Would never be the same
[Verse 2]
It's better people love one another
'Cause living your life can be tough
It's better people speak to each other
Your shame is not enough
If everybody came alive
And stayed alive
And lived their lives instead, yeah
So come outside
And feel the light
It's cold inside
And it's lonely in your bed
In your bed
[Chorus 2]
And you thought we might be
But what you heard before
Was sleeping in your brain
But if you came with me
The days would never end
Would never be the same
Would never be the same
Let us go by a different name
Would never be the same
