[Intro]
Wha, yeah!
C'mon, yeah
Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Yeah, c'mon
Oh, yeah, ma
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girl understand
[Bridge]
Hey, all you people that tryin' to sleep
I'm out to make it with my midnight creep, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
All right, yeah
[Verse 1]
You men eat your dinner
Eat your pork and beans
I eat more chicken
Than any man ever seen, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm a back door man, wha
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
Well, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
Whoa, baby, I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
