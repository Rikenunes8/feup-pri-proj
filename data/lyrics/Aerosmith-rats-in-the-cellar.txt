[Verse 1]
I'm going under, 
rats are in the cellar
Going under, skin's turning yellow
Nose is runny, losing my connection
Losing money, getting no affection
[Chorus]
New York City blues
East side, west side news
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you
Can believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart
[Verse 2]
I'm safe complaining, because everything's rotten
Goin' insanin', and everything's forgotten
Feeling cozy, 
rats are in the cellar
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow
Loose and soggy, looking rather lazy
See my body, pushing up a-daisies
[Chorus]
New York City's dues
East side, west side news
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you
Can believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
New York City blues
East side, west side news
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you
Can believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart[Outro]
