[Verse 1]
You can't imagine how it hurts me
To have you treat me like you do
Knowing that my love is just a joke to you
But I'll take it just to see you and laugh as tear-drops fall
[Chorus]
So when you need a laugh, give me a call
[Verse 2]
Everybody says I'm crazy to let you treat me this way
But I can't explain, so what else can I say?
At least I'm on your mind when you're laughing
Somehow that breaks the fall
[Chorus]
So when you need a laugh, give me a call
[Bridge]
I'd gladly trade the laugh you get for making fun of me
To be around the one I love and need so desperately
So even if the laugh's on me, I don't mind at all
[Chorus]
So when you need a laugh, give me a call
[Outro]
So when you need a laugh
Give me a call
