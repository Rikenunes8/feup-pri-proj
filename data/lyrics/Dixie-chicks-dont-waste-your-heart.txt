[Verse 1]
For the life of me
I can't believe that you're on your knees, beggin' please
All the pushin' away and puttin' down
Can't you see you're gettin' the run around
[Verse 2]
Oh, it's plain to see you'd rescue me
From my loneliness, so-called unhappiness
Oh, I didn't mean to cause you pain
I've got nothin' to lose and nothin' to gain
[Chorus]
You don't waste your heart on a wild thing
She's got a soul that won't settle on one thing
Whoa, this bird can't sing when you've tied its wings
Don't waste your heart on me
[Bridge]
It's funny how the girls get burned
And, honey, as far as I'm concerned
The tables have turned
[Chorus]
You don't waste your heart on a wild thing
She's got a soul that won't settle on one thing
Whoa, this bird can't sing when you've tied its wings
Don't waste your heart on me
[Outro]
And I'm here to apologize
My heart can't compromise
Don't waste your heart on me
