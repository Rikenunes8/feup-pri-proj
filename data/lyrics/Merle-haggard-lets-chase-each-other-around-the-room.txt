[Chorus]
Let's chase each other around the room tonight
Let's play the games we played on our wedding night
To lock and bolt the door is only right
Let's chase each other around the room tonight
[Verse 1]
Seems like lately people love to play with fire
And the other games they play are just as bad
I'd rather stay at home and feel your burning lips
And play the kind of games that make me glad
[Chorus]
Let's chase each other around the room tonight
Let's play the kind of games we played on our wedding night
To lock and bolt the door is only right
Let's chase each other around the room tonight
[Verse 2]
Let's don't chase around and make each other weary
Let's keep all our love at home and out of sight
Let's leave everything like jealousy behind us
And let's chase each other around the room tonight
[Chorus]
Let's chase each other around the room tonight
Let's play the games we played on our wedding night
And to lock and bolt the door is only right
Honey, let's chase each other around the room tonight
