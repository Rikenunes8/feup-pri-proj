[Verse 1]
Let's go walkin' on the water
Come all the way, please
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
[Verse 2]
No need to be scared
Let's jump into the day
I wanna know
I think I oughta go
[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and make believe
You can do whatever you please
I wanna know
I think I better go
[Verse 4]
Let's go walkin' on the water
Now you think I'm Satan's daughter
I wanna know
Please let me go
[Verse 5]
Just too quick
Now I think I'm gonna be sick
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
[Verse 6]
I'm trying for the future
It's funny that way
I wanna know
I wanna know
[Verse 7]
I took a look into the hate
It made me feel very up to date
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?[Verse 8]
Hold me tight, down on my knees
So I don't go burning 'cross the breeze
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
[Hook]
Burning 'cross the breeze
Burning 'cross the breeze
Blowing 'cross the breeze
[Instrumental Outro]
