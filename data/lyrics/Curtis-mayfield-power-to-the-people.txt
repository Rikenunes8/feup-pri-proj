[Chorus]
We want the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country, dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear
[Verse 1]
We as the young wish to say in this song
God bless great America
We give thanks to the old for acheiving their goal
It is now up to us and we know we must build up a trust
[Chorus]
And we want the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country, dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear
Power for the people
Power for the people
Power for the people
Power for the people
[Verse 2]
Hardening crimes is a part of the times
And it's rough for some people to live
Disease can move fast but it don't have to last
It is now the nation's turn for all to be concerned
We can be freer still, it is the people's will
[Chorus]
And bring back the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country, dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear
[Outro]
Power for the people
Power for the people
Power for the people
Power for the people
Pow-pow power
Pow-pow power
