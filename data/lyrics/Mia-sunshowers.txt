[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
I bongo with my lingo
And beat it like a wing, yo
To Congo,
 to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing, yo
I salt and pepper my mango
Shoot, spit out the window
Bingo, I got him in the thing, yo
Now what? I'm doing my thing, yo
Quit bending all my fingo
Quit beating me like you're Ringo
You wanna go? You wanna win a war?
Like P.L.O. I don't surrendo'
[Chorus: Nesreen Shah]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
I bongo with my lingo
And beat like a wing, yo
To Congo, to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing, yo
I checked that mouth on 'im
Fucking checked that gas on 'im
I had him
, cornered 'im
Fucking shut that gate on 'im
Why would you listen to him?
He had his way, I'm bored of him
I'm tired of him
I don't wanna be as bad as 'im
It's a bomb, yo
So run, yo
Put away your stupid gun, yo
'Cause see through like protocol
That's why we blow it up 'fore we go
[Chorus: Nesreen Shah]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
Semi-9 and snipered 'im
On that wall they posted 'im
They cornered 'im
And then just murdered 'im
He told them he didn't know them
He wasn't there they didn't know him
They showed him a picture then
Ain't that you with the muslims?
He had Colgate on his teeth
And Reebok Classics on his feet
At a factory he does Nike
And then helps the family
Beat heart beat
He's made it to the Newsweek
Sweetheart seen it
He's doing it for the peeps
Peace
[Chorus: Nesreen Shah]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
