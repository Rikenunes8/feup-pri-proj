"Uh, funky baby
Lay it on me now
Not so hard, man"
Yoâ€¦
I've got Chinese eyes and Chinese suits (Lay it on me now)
Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots
More updated on the hip-hop lingo (Not so hard, man)
My favorite New York Knick was Harthorne Wingo
Met a girl at a party, and I gave her my card
Man, you know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte
 (Lay it on me now)
Peepin' out the colors, I be buggin' on Cezanne
They call me Mike D, Joe Blow, the Lover Man
Well, your face turns red as your glass of wine
That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time (Lay it on me now)
Girl, you should be with me, you should drop that bum
'Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Stripe Gum
With that big round butt of yours
I'd like to butter your muffin
--I'm not bluffin'
Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'
("And what it")
Stuffing, stuffing
Stuff it, buddy
