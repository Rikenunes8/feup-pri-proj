[Verse 1]
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does
[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does
[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does
[Verse 3]
I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does
[Outro]
Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
