[Verse 1]
There goes my baby
There goes my only one
I think she loves me
But she don't want to let on
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, she likes to keep me guessing
She's got me on the fence
With that little bit of mystery
She's a complex kid
And she's always been so hard to figure out
Yeah, she always like to leave me with a shadow of a doubt
Oh!
[Verse 2]
Sometimes at night, I
Wait around 'til she gets out
She don't like working
She says she hates her boss
[Chorus 2]
But she's got me asking questions
She's got me on defense
With that little certain something
She's a complex kid
And she's always been so hard to get around
Yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt
[Bridge]
Just a shadow of a doubt
She seldom keeps me running
I'm trying to figure out
If she's leading up to something
Oh!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
And when she's dreaming
Sometimes she sings in French
But in the morning
She don't remember it[Chorus 3]
But she's got me thinking about it
Yeah, she's got me on the edge
With that little bit of mystery
She's a complex kid
And she's always been so hard to live without
Yeah, she always like to leave me with a shadow of a doubt
[Outro]
Well, a shadow of a doubt
A shadow of a doubt
