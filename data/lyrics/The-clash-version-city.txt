There is a train at Version City
Waiting for the rhythm mail
If you can jump then jump right now
She can pull you through to better days
Is that the train that they speak of
The one I heard in my younger days
All great bluesmen have rode her
I'm jumping up going to ride that train
There's a lonely soul out on the crossroads
He's waiting there in the pouring rain
He's looking for that great ride yeah
That'll take him to oh what's her name?
So I rode that train from Version City
For ninety-nine and one half days
I never heard such rhythm sound
It was in my soul which was on the train
We went straight through Syndrome Junction
Up and over the Acapella Pass
Then Gibson Town and Fenderville
All stations to the Mesa Boogie ranch
We saw that soul out on the crossroads
Waiting there in the pouring rain
We called hey engine slow your rhythms
See he wants to ride the version train
We rode that train from Version City
For ninety-nine and one half years
I never seen such funky country
While riding with the engineers
I could not fill no application
Before I rode this rhythm train
I could not work at my station
Before I rode the version train
There is a train, there is a train at Version City
Waiting for the rhythm mail
If you can jump then jump right now
She can pull you through to better daysShe can pull you through to better days
Pull you through to better days (x3)
