[Intro]
Piss off, cake
[Verse 1]
Too many people going underground
Too many reaching for a piece of cake
Too many people pulled and pushed around
Too many waiting for that lucky break
[Chorus]
That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two
[Verse 2]
Too many people sharing party lines
Too many people never sleep-in late
Too many people paying parking fines
Too many hungry people losing weight
[Chorus]
That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Too many people preaching practices
Don't let them tell you what you wanna be
Too many people holding back
This is crazy, and baby, it's not like me
[Chorus]
That was your last mistake
I find my love awake and waiting to be
Now what can be done for you?
She's waiting for me, yeah
