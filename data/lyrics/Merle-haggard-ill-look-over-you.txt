[Chorus]
I'll look over things you do because I love you so
And I'll be standing on the sideline while you play
It's your life to live the way you want to live
And I'll look over you, if you'll just let me stay
[Verse]
It's no fault of yours if I can't give the thrill you need
And I know someday you'll find someone who can
Though it hurts to see you stare at every guy you see
But I'll look over you and try to understand
[Chorus]
I'll look over things you do because I love you so
And I'll be standing on the sideline while you play
It's your life to live the way you want to live
And I'll look over you, if you'll just let me stay
