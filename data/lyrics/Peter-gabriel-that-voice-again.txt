[Chorus]
I wanna be with you, I wanna be clear
But each time I try, it's the voice I hear
I hear that voice again
[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm listening to the conversation
Judge and jury in my head
It's colouring everything
All we did and said
And still I hear that sharp tongue talking
Talking tangled words
I can sense the danger
Just listen to the wind
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
I want you close, I want you near
I can't help but listen, but I don't wanna hear
Hear that voice again
[Chorus]
And I wanna be with you, I wanna be clear
But each time I try, it's the voice I hear
I hear that voice again
[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm hearing right and wrong so clearly
There must be more than this
It's only in uncertainty
That we're naked and alive
I hear it through the rattle of a streetcar
Hear it through the things you said
I can get so scared
Listen to the wind
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
I want you close, I want you near
I can't help but listen, but I don't want to hear
Hear that voice again[Bridge]
What I carry in my heart
Brings us so close or so far apart
Only love can make love
[Chorus]
And I want you close and I want you near
I can't help but listen, but I don't wanna hear
I hear that voice again
[Chorus]
I wanna be with you, I wanna be clear
But each time I try, it's the voice I hear
I hear that voice again
