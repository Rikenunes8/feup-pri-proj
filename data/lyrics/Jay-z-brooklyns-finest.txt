[Intro: Pain In Da Ass, 
Clark Kent
 & 
JAY-Z
]
Okay, I'm reloaded
You motherfuckers think you big time?
Fucking with Jay-Z, you gon' die, big time
Here come ''The Pain''
Jigga (Jigga), Bigga (Bigga), nigga, how you figure? (How you figure?
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Jay-Z & 
The Notorious B.I.G
]
Ayo, peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (
Uh-huh
)
The number one question is can the feds get us (
Uh-huh
)
I got vendettas in dice games against ass bettors (
Uh-huh
)
And niggas who pump wheels and drive Jettas
Take that with you
[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & 
Jay-Z
]
Hit you, back-split you (Uh)
Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles (Uh)
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle (Woo)
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle (
Mmm-hmm
)
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug-related (
Haha
)
Most hated
[Verse 3: Jay-Z & 
The Notorious B.I.G
]
Can't fade it
 (
Uh
)
While y'all pump, willie (
What?
), I run up and stunt silly (
Uh-huh
)
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me (
Uh
)
But on the con-trilli, I packs the MAC-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathing soft on him
"What's ya name?"
[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Who shot you? Mob ties like Sinatra (Uh)
Peruvians tried to do me in (Word), I ain't paid them yet
Tryna' push 700s, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit (Frostbit), rings too
Niggas 'round the way call me Igloo, stick who?
Motherfucker
[Chorus: Clark Kent & 
The Notorious B.I.G.
]
JAY-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers (Where you from?)
Brooklyn, going out for all (Marcy)
That's right, you don't stop (Bed-Stuy)
Uh-huh, you won't stop (Nigga)
What, what, what?[Verse 5: JAY-Z &

JAY-Z, Big Smalls, nigga, shit your drawers
Brooklyn represent y'all, hit you fold
You crazy, think your little bit of rhymes can play me?
I'm from Marcy, I'm varsity, chump, you're JV
Jigga
 JAY-Z
Biggie, baby (Uh)
My Bed-Stuy flow's malicious, delicious
Fuck three wishes, made my road to riches
From 62s, Gemstars, my mom's dishes (Uh)
Gram chopping, police van docking
Ds at my doors knocking (What?)
Keep rocking, yeah
No more Mr. Nice Guy, I twist your shit
The fuck back with the pistols, 
blazin'
Hot like 
Cajun
 (
Uh
)
Hotter than even holdin' work at the 
Days Inn
With New York plates outside
Get up out of there, fuck the ride
[Verse 6: The Notorious B.I.G & 
Jay-Z
]
Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper (Uh)
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank White
Need the keys to your InnKeeper (
That's right
)
Chill, homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me
You're holding more drugs than a pharmacy
You ain't harming me, so pardon me
Pass the safe, before I blaze the place
And here's six shots just in case
(

Nigga please, like short sleeves, I bear arms (
Umm

Stay out my way from here on (
Clear?

Uh)
Me and Gutta had two spots
The two-for-five dollar hits, the blue tops (Uh-huh)

If Faith have twins, she'd probably have two Pacs
 (Uh)
Get it? two Pac's?
 (Uh, uh, uh)

 &

Time to separate the pros from the cons (And the)
The platinum from the bronze
That butter-soft shit from that

A S1 diamond from a 
I class don
A Chandon sipper from a Ros√© nigga, 
Huh?
Brook-Nam, 
sipping on
Cristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather (Uh)
The M.A.F.I.A. keep cannons in they Marc Buchanans (Uh)
Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow
Tossing you, mad slugs through your Nautica
I'm warning you
 (Ha, what the fuck?)
