[Intro: Merry Clayton]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
[Verse 1: Mick Jagger]
Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
[Chorus: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
, yeah
[Verse 2: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red-coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way
[Chorus: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
,yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
[Guitar Solo 2:03 - 2:43]
Hey, hey
[Bridge: Merry Clayton]
Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder (Woo)
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Yeah[Verse 3: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Mmm, the flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away
[Chorus - Variation: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
[Outro: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away, kiss away)
