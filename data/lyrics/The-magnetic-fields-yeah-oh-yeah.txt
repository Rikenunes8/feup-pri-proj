[Verse 1: Claudia Gonson, 
Stephin Merritt
]
Are you out of love with me?
Are you longing to be free?
Do I drive you up a tree?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Verse 2: Claudia Gonson, 
Stephin Merritt
]
Do I drive you up the wall?
Do you dread every phone call?
Can you not stand me at all?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Verse 3: Claudia Gonson, 
Stephin Merritt
]
Though I need you more than air
Is it true you just don't care?
Are you having an affair?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Bridge 1: Stephin Merritt]
When we met I thought money was everything
So I let you buy the house, the cars, the ring
But I can't take your perpetual whining
And you can't sing
[Stephin Merritt & Claudia Gonson]
Aa aa aa aa aa aa aa
Aa aa aa aa aa aa aa
Aa aa aa aa aa aa aa
[Stephin Merritt]
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Verse 4: Claudia Gonson, 
Stephin Merritt
]
I thought if we lived apart
We could make a brand-new start
Do you want to break my heart?
Yeah! Oh, yeah![Bridge 2: Stephin Merritt]
I've enjoyed making you miserable for years
Found peace of mind in playing on your fears
How I loved to catch your gold and silver tears
But now my dear
[Verse 5: Claudia Gonson, 
Stephin Merritt
]
What a dark and dreary life
Are you reaching for a knife?
Could you really kill your wife?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Verse 6: Claudia Gonson, 
Stephin Merritt
]
Oh, I die, I die, I die!
So it's over, you and I
Was my whole life just a lie?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
