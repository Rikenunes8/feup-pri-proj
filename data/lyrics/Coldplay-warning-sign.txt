[Verse 1]
A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
[Chorus]
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah, the truth is
That I miss you so
[Verse 2]
A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign, yeah
[Chorus]
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah, the truth is
That I miss you so
[Post-Chorus]
And I'm tired
I should not have let you go[Outro]
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
