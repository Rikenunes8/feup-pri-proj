Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
She can't be found
But love doesn't care, doesn't care
Ah, don't despair
The next time around, she'll be there
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
I wouldn't make her
Her wooden table, I wouldn't care
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Don't be long
My heart isn't strong, don't be long
Ah, never fear
The next time around, she'll be here
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
