Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
I need some help, I get beside myself
And I got so many things in life to do
Like, reach for a star
Or maybe shoot ten under par
I'd like to do it all before I'm through
Fly into space, or maybe save the human race
All these things seem so appealing
But I'll never get the chance
Cuz all I do is dance
My mama said my brains are in my feet
Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
Papa told me
Every night when he would scold me
He knew I'd never make him very proud
So I ran away from home to live all alone
And make myself a stand-out in the crowd
Then it hit, my ideas began to fit
I had to be what I was meant to be
Now my name is up in lights
And I hoof here every night
They were right
My brains are in my feet
Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
