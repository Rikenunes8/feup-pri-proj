[Verse 1]
Little Billy was the fattest kid in his class
Always the last in line
All the other little kids would laugh at him
Said he'd die before his time
[Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy didn't mind
[Verse 2]
Most of the kids smoked cigarettes
Just to prove that they were cool
The teacher didn't know about the children's games
And Billy always followed the rules
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Billy was big on the outside
But there's an even bigger man inside
Ten million cigarettes burning every day
And Billy's still doing fine
[Verse 3]
Now Billy and his classmates are middle-aged
With children of their own
Their smoking games are reality now
And cancer's seed is sown
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Most of them smoke maybe forty a day
A habit Billy doesn't share
One by one they're passing away
Leaving orphans to Billy's care[Outro]
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy doesn't mind
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy's doing fine
