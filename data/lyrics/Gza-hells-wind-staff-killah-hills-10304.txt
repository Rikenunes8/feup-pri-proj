Life of a drug dealer
Killah Hills 10304
[Verse: GZA]
Restaurant's on a stakeout, so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed the wedding, late a fuckin' half-hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contractin' bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, interest rate’s a grand to a finger
In the garment district, 
got it sewn like Singers
'Cause all that talk blasphemy
This kid after me for the heist in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it! He turned state's on my nigga, Castro
This copilot who used to drop rice sacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles south from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious, custom-made yachts
Burial plots for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man, Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern bomb specialist
Initiated at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker — tried to smuggle a half-a-key in his left leg
Even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the Feds rushed him, comin' through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singin'
A well known soprano, a smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan: Minimum for the hit — two hundred grand
Half-time at the game, blastin' niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor
Judges are sent photographs of they wives takin' baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five — that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide!
First rule — anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer, and fifty immigrants with fake Visas[Outro: GZA]
