[Intro]
My lover's mouth
Been so good to me
My lover's mouth
Been so good to me
It promised joy for a jailhouse
And a broken key
[Chorus 1]
Woah, God, I got a job
On the chamber's walls of heartache
Woah, God, it's hard
On the chamber's walls of heartache
Baby, don't let me shuffle
Cause another one do
Another one to
[Verse 1]
My man's run off
Leave me motherless
My man's run off
Leave me motherless
That man, he ran
Just like a break in a dam
[Chorus 1]
Woah, God, I got a job
On the chamber's walls of heartache
Woah, God, it's hard
On the chamber's walls of heartache
Baby, don't let me shuffle
Cause another one do
Another one too
[Bridge]
Three, four, five, seven
You'll never get to heaven
Don't talk wonder
Cause God broke thunder above
You were lookin' to hurt
And I was hurtin' to love
My my my my my
My my, well if it isn't everlovin' you
My my, well if it isn't everlovin' you[Verse 2]
Go live as long as an elephant
Go live as long as an elephant
But there won't be
More lovin' woman than me
[Chorus 2]
Woah, got to get gone
Better ride from the hill on heartache
Woah, got to get gone
Better ride from the hill on heartache
Baby, don't let me suffer
Cause another one
[Outro]
My baby don't love me?
Hitch hike
And damn be done
Damn be done
Damn be done
Damn be done
Damn be done
Damn be done
Damn be done
Damn be done
