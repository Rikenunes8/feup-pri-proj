[Verse 1]
Take my hand
I've changed my mind again
Really, I believed it true
That all who fell in love were foolish
But I was wrong
I've learned that lesson well
All the way back home at midnight
You were sleeping on my shoulder
[Chorus]
Take my hand
Don't think of obligations
Now, right now
Your love is liberation
[Verse 2]
To free in me
The trust I never dared
I always thought the risk too great
But suddenly I don't hesitate so
[Chorus]
Take my hand
Don't think of complications
Now, right now
Your love is liberation
Liberation
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
The night, the stars
A light shone through the dark
All the way back home at midnight
You were sleeping on my shoulder
[Chorus]
Take my hand
Don't think of hesitation
Now, right now
Your love is liberation
Liberation[Interlude]
[Outro]
Back home at midnight
All the way back home at midnight
