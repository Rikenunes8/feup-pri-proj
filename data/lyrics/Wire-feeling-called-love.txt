[Hook]
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I don't understand no how?
[Verse]
Maybe I should try it now
Or maybe I should be shy of it now, now, now, now, now
'Cos there's nothing you know that can explain it
And there's nothing you know that's worth the pain of it
[Hook]
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I don't understand no how?
[Outro]
Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
