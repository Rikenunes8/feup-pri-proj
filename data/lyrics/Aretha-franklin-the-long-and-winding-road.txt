[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before, yeah
It always leads me here
Leads me to your door
[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears (My darling, my darling)
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
[Chorus]
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyhow you'll never know
All the things I've tried
Still they lead me back (Still they lead me back)
To that long and winding road
[Verse 3]
You left me standing here (My darling, my darling)
A long, long time ago, yeah
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to you door
[Chorus]
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
But anyhow he'll never know
All the things I've tried
Oh, many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried, oh yeah
Anyhow you'll never know
All the things that I've tried
Many times I've been alone
Many times that I've cried
And anyhow you'll never know
All the things I've tried
I've been on the long and winding road a long time
The long and winding road
Sometimes trying
Oh, yes I have
Sometimes crying
Oh, yes I have
It's been a long winding road
