In my life
I have known many sorrows
In my time
Troubles have shadowed my way
And my path has been covered
With teardrops from my eyes
Like the cold, cold rain
That comes in the fall
Oh, but I have found my way through the darkness
And nobody but you could have brought me out, mmm, yes
You fill my life with sunshine
You always bring me gladness
And nobody but you could have brought me out
I've seen men on their knees come crawling
And my friends begging a lot all of their days
And I have found my, found the road down the mountain, you know I have
And the cold wind's blowing through my hair, yeah
You know, that I have found my way through the darkness
And nobody but you could have brought me out
You fill my life with sunshine, oh, yes you do
(You always bring me gladness)
Said, nobody but you could have brought me out, yeah
I found my way through the darkness
Said, nobody but you could have brought me out, oh
You fill, you fill it with sunshine, oh, oh
I have found, yeah
