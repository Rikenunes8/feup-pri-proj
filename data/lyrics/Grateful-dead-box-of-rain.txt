[Verse 1]
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky
[Chorus 1]
What do you want me to do
To do for you
 to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago
[Verse 2]
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you
[Chorus 2]
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you
 
find me dreaming, too
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home
[Chorus 3]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago[Verse 4]
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear
[Chorus 4]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through
[Verse 5]
Just a box of rain, wind, and water
Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, wind and rain
In and out the window 
like a moth before a flame
[Outro]
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there
