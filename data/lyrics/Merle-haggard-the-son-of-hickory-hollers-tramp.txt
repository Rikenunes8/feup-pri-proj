[Chorus]
Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door, there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night, a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
[Verse 1]
The corn was dry and the weeds were high when Daddy took to drinking
Him and Lucy Walker, they took up and ran away
Mama cried a tear and then she promised fourteen children
"I swear you'll never see a hungry day."
When Mama sacrificed her pride, the neighbors started talking
But I was much too young to understand the things they said
The thing that mattered most of all was Mama's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss before we went to bed
[Chorus]
Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door, there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night, a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
[Verse 2]
When Daddy left and destitution came upon our family
Not one neighbor volunteered to give a helping hand
So just let 'em gossip all they want, she loved us and she raised us
The proof is standing here, a full grown man
Last summer Mama passed away and left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is more than grateful for their birth
Each Sunday, she receives a fresh bouquet of fourteen roses
And a card that reads "The Greatest Mom on Earth"
[Chorus]
Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door, there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night, a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
Yea, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
