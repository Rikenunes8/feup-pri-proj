[Verse 1]
Here's my philosophy
Livin' in a penitentiary
Brothers all on the corner
Tryin' to make believe
Turn around ain't got no pot to pee
Make me mad when I see ya sad
Can't stand to see ya hustle doin' bad
But you can't win when your will is weak
When you're knocked on the ground
[Bridge]
Evil, don't you test me
Evil, you won't win
[Hook]
Oh why world
Why world
Do want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Oh why world
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm tellin' you the truth
I hope I'm not being too cruel
Since you ain't playing by the rules
I'm 'bout to kick you off your stool
[Bridge]
Evil, don't you test me
Evil, you won't win
[Hook]
Oh why world
Why world
Do want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Oh why world
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah[Verse 3]
I am a warrior princess
I have come from the other sun
Gather all of your members
Unite them as one
Move together in harmony
Build a bridge
Now destroy a bridge
Eliminate your weakness
Conquer evil, the demon
And live forever together
[Outro]
Oh why can't we get along and
Take all the funky tones
And make up a funky song
That be bangin' on and on
Make me mad when I see ya sad
With the same look ya momma had
But ya can't win when your will is weak
But ya get out ya seat
Oh why Why Why world
Do you want me to be so mad
So mad yeah
Why in the world
Why world do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Why in the world
Why world do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Why in the world
Why world do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Why make me, make me, make me, make me, make me so mad
Why yeah, why yeah, why yeah
