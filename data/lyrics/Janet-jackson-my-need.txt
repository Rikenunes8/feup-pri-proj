[Chorus]
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like
[Verse 1]
I know you know what exactly's on my mind
I can't help myself
Part of how I feel tonight
Won't make excuses
I just want you inside, baby
We don't need to talk about no promises
[Chorus]
My love, my need (My need)
Tonight (Tonight), I feel so tight (Really, really need)
My love (My love), my need (My need)
Tonight (Tonight), just how I like
[Verse 2]
Let's just pretend that we have no more tomorrow
Can we make love like it's our last time, baby?
Let's not get too soft and gentle with it 'cause
I am not feelin' in no mood to play around
[Chorus]
My love, my need (My need)
Tonight (Tonight), I feel so tight (Really, really need)
My love (My love), my need (My need)
Tonight (Tonight), just how I like
[Post-Chorus]
I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
I need you
Like a bruise needs the pain
I need you
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea[Chorus]
My love (My love), my need (My need)
Tonight (Tonight), I feel so tight (I'm gonna need it, babe)
My love (My love), my need (My need)
Tonight (Tonight), just how I like
[Post-Chorus]
I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
I need you
Like a bruise needs the pain
I need you
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea
(My love, my love)
(My love, my love)
[Outro]
I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
I need you
Like a bruise needs the pain (My love)
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea
