[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home
[Refrain]
Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?
[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Well, what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"
[Refrain]
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?
[Verse 3]
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel to
Be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone
[Refrain]
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?[Verse 4]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known
[Refrain]
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?
[Verse 5]
Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"[Refrain]
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?
[Verse 6]
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "Now"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back "You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home"
[Refrain]
And you know something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?
[Verse 7]
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
[Refrain]
'Cause something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you,
 
Mister Jones
?
