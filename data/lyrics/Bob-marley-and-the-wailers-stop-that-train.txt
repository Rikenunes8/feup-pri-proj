[Chorus]
Stop that train: I'm leaving - today!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
[Verse 1]
All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teaching my people who don't understand
And even though I tried my best
I still can't find no happiness
So I got to say
[Chorus]
Stop that train: I'm leaving - any day, now
Stop that train: I'm leaving - don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
[Verse 2]
Some going east; and-a some going west
Some stand aside to try their best
Some living big, but the most is living small
They just can't еven find no food at allI mean, stop it
[Chorus]
Stop that train: I'm leaving - lеaving, mm-hmm
Stop that train: I'm leaving - I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
[Chorus]
Stop that train: I'm leaving – leaving!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - can't take it!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong [fadeout]
