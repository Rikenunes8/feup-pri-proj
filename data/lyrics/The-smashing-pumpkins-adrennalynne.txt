[Verse 1]
I'm taut inside the moment, moment
I never aim for reasons, reasons
And so despite true meanings, meanings
I can't feel for anything
And I won't speak on what I mean
Come ask for why
Or I shalln't but steal of you
Surrender takes a form with thee
Come ask for why
Come ask for why
[Chorus]
When you're on the stage
When you feel the eyes fall to you
Make no mistake or find
When you're on the stage
There isn't blood to squander
When you're on the stage, you'll find
When you're on the stage, that's life
When you're on the stage, that's life
[Verse 2]
I'm taut inside the movement, movement
A jake of which there's no door, no door
A fear of which there's no floor, no floor
These lives aren't real for anyone
These riffs don't mean shit but what I want
Come ask for why
'Cause hearts like bombs can't belong
Surrender, please and please no more
Come ask for why
Come ask for why
[Chorus]
When you're on the stage
When you feel the eyes fall to you
Make no mistake or find
When you're on the stage
There isn't blood to squander
When you're on the stage, you'll find
When you're on the stage, that's life
When you're on the stage, that's life
When you're on the stage
When you feel the eyes fall to you
Make no mistake, that's life
Make no mistake, that's life
