[Verse 1]
She's got a cigarette on each arm
She's got the lily-white cavity crazes
She's got a carburetor tied to the moon
Pink eyes looking to the food of the ages
[Chorus]
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
[Verse 2]
She's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery bog
Throwing troubles to the dying embers
[Chorus]
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
[Chorus]
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
[Verse 3]
She's got a paradise camouflage
Like a whip-crack sending me shivers
She's the boat in a strip mine ocean
Riding low on the drunken rivers
[Chorus]
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
