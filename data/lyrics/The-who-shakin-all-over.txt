When you move in right up close to me
That's when I get the shakes all over me
Quivers down my backbone
I got the shakes in the knee bones
Quivers in my thigh bones
Like I'm
Shakin' all over
That's what happens when you say goodnight to me
Bring this feeling all inside of me
Quivers down my backbone
I got the shakes in the knee bones
Quivers in the thigh bones
Like I'm
Shakin' all over
Quivers down my backbone
I got the shakes in the knee bones
Quivers in the thigh bones
Like I'm
Shakin' all over
