[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy (Crazy)
Make him call me mama (Mama), make him my new baby (Baby)
New and improved, they're saying "thank you very much"
Living legend - you can look, but don't touch
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to Heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to Heaven, this is twice as nice
[Post-Chorus]
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
[Verse 2]
This ain't no foolishness or fuckery, I'm handling my business
Holler if you hear me, can I get a witness?
Preacher, preacher, I'm the teacher, you can learn
Watch your fingers, boy, you might get burned
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to Heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to Heaven, this is twice as nice
[Post-Chorus]
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
[Bridge]
As you can see (see)
Fortunately, I'm cold as fire (Yeah, I'm cold as fire)
Yeah, make you believe
Make you stop and breathe (Breathe)
I'll take you higher
I'm just too cool
Make it do what it do
I'm hot as ice now (Yeah, I'm hot as ice now)
Make you feel like Heaven (Heaven) twenty four seven (Seven)
I'm hot as ice now, oh![Chorus]
Cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
[Post-Chorus]
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
