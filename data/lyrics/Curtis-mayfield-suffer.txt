Standing here alone
Looking off to the sky
Even the stars seem to be mated
And I ask myself why
I can't understand why
I never made a play
When you were so pretty to me in every way
Why couldn't I see you were in love with me?
Why didn't I know just which way to go?
Now I cannot forget
Standing here with the fear
And now I must suffer
Oh everybody know this woman I loved
What will I become?
Loneliness blends with the sun
But there for me I already see
I don't want you away from me
If only I wasn't so blind
And gave you some kind of sign
This might not have been
Yes it's me standing out looking in
Throw your heart out the door
I guess I won't do it no more
Now I got to suffer
The woman I loved her
It seems sometimes in life
You waste a sacrifice
The lack of the love you show her
Can show her the things right on out the door
Why couldn't I see you were in love with me?
This might not have been
Yes it's me standing out looking in
Throw your heart out the door
I guess I won't do that no more
Now I got to suffer
The loss of the woman I loved her
It seems sometimes in life
You waste your sacrifice
I don't know what come over me
Just got to let it be
Suffer
I got to suffer
Suffer
Got to
Got to
Got to suffer
Got to suffer
Got to suffer
Got to suffer
Got to suffer
