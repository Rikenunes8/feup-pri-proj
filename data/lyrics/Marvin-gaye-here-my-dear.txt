I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you
Although perhaps I may not be happy
This is what you want
So I conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, babe
I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine
So here it is, babe
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and grey
Bad
But you taught me that was life
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
Always think of me the way I was
Ha, I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, dear, here it is
Here, my dear, here it is
