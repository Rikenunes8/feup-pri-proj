[Verse]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'till four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
