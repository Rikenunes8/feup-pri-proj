[Verse 1]
I fell in love with a working girl, Lord, she sure was sweet
I met her down in a red light tavern working on Bourbon Street
Way down in the old French Quarters, the bright lights side of town
Daytime life sure is cozy living with the shades pulled down
[Chorus]
Living with the shades pulled down all day
Loving while the world goes around
Nobody knows what all we're doing
Living with the shades pulled down
[Verse 2]
Some might get the wrong idea about the kind of man I am
But I bring home my half of the bacon picking in a guitar band
Love is all my working girl brings me coming in off the town
Daytime life sure gets cozy living with the shades pulled down
[Chorus]
Living with the shades pulled down all day
Loving while the world goes around
Nobody knows what all we're doing
Living with the shades pulled down
[Chorus]
Living with the shades pulled down all day
Loving while the world goes around
Nobody knows what all we're doing
Living with the shades pulled down
[Chorus]
Living with the shades pulled down all day
Loving while the world goes around
Nobody knows what all we're doing
Living with the shades pulled down
