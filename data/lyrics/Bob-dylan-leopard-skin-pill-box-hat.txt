[Verse 1]
Well, I see you got your
Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Yes, I see you got your
Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 2]
Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see
If it's really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 3]
Well, if you want to see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head
And you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
"It's bad for your health," he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you, but I found him there instead
You know, I don't mind you cheatin' on me
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 5]
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you makin' love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
It's your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
