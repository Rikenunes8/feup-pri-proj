[Verse 1]
Two o'clock in the mornin', baby
I know it's late, I know it's late
I'm young and I like the night
And I can make you feel all right
I've been around for quite a while
And I've learned how to make you smile
I know you won't refuse
You know I'm fast and loose
[Verse 2]
Two o'clock in the mornin', sugar
I know you're sleepin', you must be sleepin'
Why don't you invite me in
Get yourself some original sin
I'll wake you up and stay in bed
Don't get up, get down instead
I don't need no excuse
You like it fast and loose
No remorse
[Verse 3]
Two o'clock in the mornin', honey
Let me in, baby let me in
You know me, you know I'm wired
I'm gonna stop you from feeling tired
I'm coming over and I won't be long
Just let me finish writing this song
I'm gonna light your fuse
I know you like it fast and loose
Fast and loose
