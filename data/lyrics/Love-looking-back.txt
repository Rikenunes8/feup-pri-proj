We all made it together
Now we're looking back

It was the best of times, the worst of times
An age of reason with the rage for rhymes
Sound of fury, sounds of silence
Cries for peace amdist the violence
Black and white issues and desegregation
Fear and loathing in the Woodstock nation
Stormy seasons, sunny skies above
Now we're looking back. Looking back with love

(Looking back, ooh looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back. Yeah)

Good vibrations, assassinations
Losing leaders, never knowing why
Demonstrations, battle stations
Times to laugh and times to cry
Rampant destruction, cosmic creation
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Hungry hawks and a peaceful dove
Now we're looking back. Looking back with love

(Looking back, ooh looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back,  ooh looking back) We all made it together
(Looking back) Now we're looking back (Yeah, we're looking back with love)
Soulful sounds from the motor city
California girls now are sure looking pretty
(Two girls for every boy)
British invasion with the Mersey beat
Mod rockers dancing in a Liverpool street
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Aquarian age running helter skelter
Frightened fans singing "gimme, gimme shelter"
Bitter-sweet reflections that we're thinking of
Now we're looking back. Looking back with love

(Looking back, ooh looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back, ooh looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Looking back with love
(Looking back, ooh looking back) We all made it together
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Now we're looking back. We're looking back with love
(Looking back, ooh looking back) We all made it together
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Now we're looking back. We're looking back with love
(Looking back, ooh looking back) We all made it together
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Now we're looking back. We're looking back with love
(Looking back, ooh looking back) We all made it together
(Looking back, yeah looking back) Now we're looking back. We're looking back with love
