[Chorus]
Just a little lovin', yeah
Will go a long ways
Well, you make me happy
The rest of my days
Why don't you put your arms around me?
And I'll be your slave
'Cause just a little lovin', baby
Will go a long way
[Verse 1]
Ever since our time began, love has ruled the world
Even Adam set the pace and started in a whirl
I met you and now I know you're the girl for me
Why don't you come on home and you will plainly see?
[Chorus]
That-that just a little lovin', baby
Will go a long way
And you make me happy
The rest of my days
Why don't you put your arms around me?
And I'll be your slave
Woah, just a little lovin'
Will go a long ways
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I don't believe you really know how much I love you
If you did you'd come on back and make my dreams come true
Your eyes, your lips, your lovin' kisses seem to linger, yeah
Well, you'll forgive but please don't you forget
[Chorus]
That-that just a little lovin', baby
Will go a long ways
Woah, you make me happy
The rest of my days
Why don't you put your arms around me?
I'll be your slave
Well, just a little lovin', little girl
Will go a long ways[Outro]
Just a little lovin' will go a long ways
Yeah
