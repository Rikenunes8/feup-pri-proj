[Verse 1: Peter Gabriel]
In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
[Chorus: Kate Bush]
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not beaten yet
Don't give up, I know you can make it good
[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
[Chorus: Kate Bush]
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up, we don't need much of anything
Don't give up, 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
[Bridge: Kate Bush & 
Peter Gabriel
]
Rest your head, you worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough, you can fall back on us
Don't give up, please don't give up
Got to walk out of here, I can't take any more
Gonna stand on that bridge, keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come and whatever may go
That river's flowing, that river's flowing
[Verse 3: Peter Gabriel]
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs[Chorus: Kate Bush]
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not the only one
Don't give up, no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up 'cause I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belong
[Interlude]
[Outro: Peter Gabriel & Kate Bush]
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
