I'm going down down to the river
I'm gonna bring a 30 pack
I'm gonna drink with all my good friends
And I ain't ever ever coming back
I got no money and I'm starving
I got nothing left
Spent it all on golden honey
And two lines of meth
I'm gonna chug a lot of jim beam
'Til my face turns brown and blue
I'm gonna get in my car and start it
And drive right over you
I got nothing else to live for
I got nowhere to be
Spent my money on that honey
And life in the beam
I wanna tell you that I like you
But my heart is black and blue
And you say that's such a bad idea
That's hard to swallow but it's harder to chew
You probably think this is funny
As I do too
I gotta keep on just laughing
Or I am through
I'm going back down to the river
I'm gonna find my duffel bag
I'm gonna stick my puppy in it
And drown him till his tail don't wag
Cause I can't spend any more money
I can't give him a bed
I gotta feed it golden honey
Or two scoops of meth
And the next thing you know I cannot feel
My air bags open on my steering wheel
Well I guess that that oak tree was kinda real
Now I gotta skip this town
I've gotta call up max and Elvis
And tell them how I feel
They're gonna call me a fucking pussy
And pass me a couple beers
We got no money got no honey
We got nothing left
Spent it all on golden honey
And two lines of meth
