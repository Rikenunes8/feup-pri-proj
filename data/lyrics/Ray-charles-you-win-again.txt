[Chorus]
What can I do? You win again
[Verse 1]
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen just a-running 'round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again
[Pre-Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do? Woah, you win again, yes
[Chorus]
What can I do? You win again
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for (
Sorry for
) you're a victim now (
Victim now
)
'Cause soon his head (
Soon his head
), like mine, will bow (
Like mine will bow
)
He'll give his heart (
Give his heart
), but all in vain (
All in vain
)
And someday say (
Someday say
), "You win again" (
You win again
)
[Bridge]
You have no heart, you have no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you still, well, you win again
[Outro]
I love you still, you win again (
Win again
)
