[Verse 1]
Don't wanna see you again or hold your hand
'Cause you don't really love me, you're not my man
You're not my man, oh you're not my man
Go back to Greenville, just go on back to Greenville
[Verse 2]
You scream and shout and you make a scene
When you open your mouth you never say what you mean
Say what you mean, oh say what you mean
Go back to Greenville, just go on back to Greenville
[Verse 3]
You drink hard liquor, you come on strong
You lose your temper, someone looks at you wrong
Looks at you wrong, oh looks at you wrong
Go back to Greenville, just go on back to Greenville
[Verse 4]
Out all night playin' in a band
Looking for a fight with a guitar in your hand
A guitar in your hand, oh a guitar in your hand
Go back to Greenville, just go on back to Greenville
[Verse 5]
Empty bottles and broken glass
Busted down doors and borrowed cash
Borrowed cash, oh the borrowed cash
Go back to Greenville, just go on back to Greenville
[Verse 6]
Lookin' for someone to save you
Lookin' for someone to rave about you
To rave about you, oh to rave about you
Go back to Greenville, just go on back to Greenville
