[Verse 1]
Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
Look up at the mountain
I have to climb
Oh yeah, to reach there
Lord, my body has been a good friend
But I won’t need it when I reach the end
Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
[Bridge]
I creep through the valleys
And I grope through the woods
’Cause I know when I find it my honey
It’s gonna make me feel good, yes
I love everything
So don’t it make you feel sad
’Cause I’ll drink to you, my baby
I’ll think to that, I’ll think to that
[Verse 2]
Miles from nowhere
Not a soul in sight
Oh yeah, but it’s alright
I have my freedom
I can make my own rules
Oh yeah, the ones that I choose
Lord, my body has been a good friend
But I won’t need it when I reach the end
[Bridge]
I love everything
So don’t it make you feel sad
’Cause I’ll drink to you, my baby
I’ll think to that, yes I’ll think to that
I'll think to that[Outro]
Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
