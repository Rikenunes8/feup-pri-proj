[Verse-1]
Here I am on my own again the days rush by
The nights all seems so slow
Guess I've let you down in my way, somehow
If you take me back I know we'll make it
We'll make a promise and then break it
[Hook]
On my honor I will try, always do the best I can
Though the tears may fall like raindrops
From your eyes, honey
On my honor I will try
[Bridge]
If you want me to be strong, give it everything I have
You'll never have to worry
We're not in a hurry
On my honor I will try
[Verse-2]
It's a lover's dance in a fiery chant
Don't be afraid to face the music, now
It's a gambler's chance not a lost romance
And I'm not you and you're not me
And sometimes we feel differently
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
I'll try
I will try
I'll try
