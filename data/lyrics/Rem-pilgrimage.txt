[Intro]
Take a turn
Take a turn
Take a fortune
Take a fortune
[Verse 1]
They called the clip
A two-headed cow
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck with pilgrimage
Rest assured, this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck, a two-headed cow
[Chorus]
The pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take a turn
Take a turn
Take a fortune
Take a fortune
[Verse 2]
Speaking in tongues
It's worth a broken lip
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck with pilgrimage
Rest assured, this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck, a two-headed cow
[Chorus]
The pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take a turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take a fortune (Take a turn)
Take a fortune[Bridge]
(Ah) Pilgrimage
(Ah) Pilgrimage
[Verse 3]
Speaking in tongues
It's worth a broken lip
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck...
Rest assured, this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck, two-headed...
[Chorus]
The pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take a turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take a fortune (Take a turn)
Take your fortune
[Bridge]
(Ah) Pilgrimage
(Ah) Pilgrimage[Chorus]
Pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your fortune (Take a turn)
Take your fortune (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your fortune (Take a turn)
Take your fortune
