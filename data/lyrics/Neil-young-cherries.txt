Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are gunning us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are gunning us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

Four dead in Ohio (Whoa!)
Four dead in Ohio (four)
Four dead in Ohio (Ah!)
Four dead in Ohio (How many more?)
Four dead in Ohio (What?)
Four dead in Ohio (Oh!)
Four dead in Ohio (Oh!)
Four dead in Ohio (What?)
Four dead in Ohio (Ah)
Four dead in Ohio
