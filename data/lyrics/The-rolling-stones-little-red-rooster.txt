[Verse 1]
I am the little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day
I am the little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day
Keep everything in the farm yard upset in every way
[Verse 2]
The dogs begin to bark and hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark and hounds begin to howl
Watch out strange kin people, little red rooster is on the prowl
[Verse 3]
If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
Ain't had no peace in the farm yard since my little red rooster's been gone
