[Verse 1]
I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
You can’t turn back, you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are
[Chorus]
Sugar Baby get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
[Verse 2]
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t
[Chorus]
Sugar Baby get on down the line
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now
[Verse 3]
The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing
[Chorus]
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now
[Verse 4]
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse[Chorus]
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
[Verse 5]
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Look up, look up, seek your Maker,’fore Gabriel blows his horn
[Chorus]
Sugar Baby, get on down the line
You ain’t got no sense, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
