[Verse 1]
I woke up to yet another day
Grown to expect, expect more of the same
Except for, for a subtle change
And that is, I'm slowly fading away
[Verse 2]
Harvest moon, soon will pass
Crop is gone, left only chaff
A bitter pill and an overcast
A flag unfurled at half mast
[Chorus]
A year to the day since you went away
A moment in time when you were last mine
I'm here standing still, with more time to kill
I barely survived, yeah, I barely survived
[Verse 3]
Like pouring salt on an open wound
Memory filling, filling this empty room
I'm as bare, I'm as bare, as a barren womb
Still like the air, in a whitewash tomb
[Chorus]
A year to the day since you went away
A moment in time when you were last mine
I'm here standing still, with more time to kill
I barely survived, yeah, I barely survived
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
A year to the day since you went away
A moment in time when you were last mine
I'm here standing still, with more time to kill
I barely survived, yeah, I barely survived[Outro]
A year to the day
Year to the day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A year to the day
Three sixty-five
Three sixty-five, five, five
