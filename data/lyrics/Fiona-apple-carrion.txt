[Verse 1]
Won't do no good to hold no s√©ance
What's gone is gone, and you can't bring it back around
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down
[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I've gone away
Hey, I've gone away
I've gone away
[Verse 2]
Won't do no good to sing no love song
No sound could simulate the presence of a man
Won't do no good asking no questions
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, honey, I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away
[Chorus]
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want
Is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk
Away
[Verse 3]
Won't do no good to go no distance
The space between us is as boundless as the dark
Won't do no good to throw no fist, babe
You can't intimidate me back into your arms[Pre-Chorus]
Because, honey, I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone
Away
[Chorus]
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want
Is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk
Away
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to
Save you, honey, or the
Strength to walk awayOhhh!
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying right in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to
Save you, honey, or the
Strength to walk away
