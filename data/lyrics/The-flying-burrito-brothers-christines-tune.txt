She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Now, a woman like that, all she does is hate you
She doesn't know what makes a man a man
She'll talk about the time that she's been with you
She'll speak your name to everyone she can
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can't do without
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
It's all right to call her, but I'll bet you
The moon is full and you're just wasting time
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
In disguise, in disguise
In disguise, in disguise
In disguise
