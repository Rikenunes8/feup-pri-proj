Start the car, let's make a midnight run
Across the river to South London
To dance to the latest hi-fi sound
Of the bass, guitar and drums
Seekin' out a rhythm that can take the tension off
Steppin' in and out of that crooked crooked beat
Take a piece of cloth, a coin for thirst
For the sweat will start to run
With a cymbal splash, a word of truth
And a rockin' bass and drum
(Chorus)
One by one they come on down
From the tower blocks of my hometown
Steppin' with the rhythm of the musical beat
Drownin' out the pressures of the crooked street
(Chorus)
It has a crooked past this crooked street
Where cars patrol this crooked beat
Badges flash and sirens wail
They'll be takin' one and all to jail
Whooooo
Prance! Prance! You want a law to dance?
Whooooooo
This particular one is a crooked crooked beat
Whaaaa
It's a bird, it's a plane
No, itâ€™s a dog-wise stylee
(Chorus)(Repeat 1st verse)
Seekin' out a rhythm
This particular one is a crooked crooked beat
