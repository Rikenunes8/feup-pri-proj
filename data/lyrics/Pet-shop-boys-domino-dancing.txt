[Intro: The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
[Interlude]
[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I've seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind
[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
Remember when we felt the sun?
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
And when you walked, you always turned every head
[Chorus: Neil Tennant & 
The Voice in Fashion
]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)
[Interlude]
[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
I thought that when we fought I was to blame
But now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more
Add another number to the score
[Chorus: Neil Tennant & 
The Voice in Fashion
]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
When you look around you wonder
Do you play to win?
Or are you just a bad loser?
[Interlude]
[Refrain: The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)
[Interlude]
[Chorus: Neil Tennant & 
The Voice in Fashion
]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)
(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)
[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
And now a storm is breaking within my heart[Chorus: Neil Tennant & 
The Voice in Fashion
]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)
[Refrain: The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)
