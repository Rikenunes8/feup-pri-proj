[Verse 1]
Feels just like a weight has lifted
How can I repay you help me understand
Currency, a fistful of tears I can afford
Fight of your life is not the cost
Time will reveal, yeah
All along, you're the one who's losing
[Hook]
Cause I, I go insane
Crazy sometimes
Trying to keep you from losing your mind
Open your eyes
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears
[Verse 2]
You can make it disappear girl
All you got to do is just, raise up, face up, stay up
All things will heal, we'll feel it, with a kiss from the skies
Don't you let it go
Don't you let it go
[Hook]
Cause I, I go insane
Crazy sometimes
Trying to keep you from losing your mind
Open your eyes
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears
[Bridge]
We gon' fight the war
We gon' fight our fears
The only thing I want to throw is a fistful of tears
We gon' fight the war
We gon' fight our fears
The only thing I got to throw is a fistful of tears--
We gon' fight the war
We gon' fight our fears (yeah)
The only thing I want to throw is a fistful of tears[Hook]
Cause I, I go insane (I go insane)
