Now can I eat you? Now can I eat you? Mmm
[Verse 1]
I gotta taste for you, now what you wanna do?
Girl, you cold, let me suck out your flu
Girl, you cold, girl, you cool
You heard of Salt N' Pepa? Well girl, you food
Girl, you hot like a bowl of hot stew
And I just stood over my stew and just blew
And when there is no more  you in the soup
I remove my spoon and drink your juice
You wanna do me, do what you wanna do
And if her job is to blow, you could bet she blew
Mic check, one, two, how's about one, two
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue
But when I find out, I'ma show and tell you
When I lift my top lip, I could still smell you
When I swallow my spit, I could still taste you
Put that pussy in my face every time I face you
It go P-U-S-S-Y
Because it's the reason I am alive
Mama, I need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive

Lil' Chris said 'Run It'
