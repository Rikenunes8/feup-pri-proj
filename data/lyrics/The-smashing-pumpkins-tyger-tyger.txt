[Chorus]
Tyger, tyger
Along that wire, prowl
For that elysian soul, I've got to know
Fang to fang
Bang your gold
For that elysian soul
[Verse 1]
(Climbs) Climbs all pearls to drag you out (You out)
What control is strong enough to mind you
Strong enough to fight?
And stung enough to waltz through
Dread, dark light
Hum that lonely view
Dead desires, this
The thrall stays in your kiss (In your kiss)
Need you, need not miss that kiss
[Chorus]
Tyger, tyger
Along that wire, prowl
For that elysian soul, I've got to know
Fang to fang
Bang your gold
For that elysian soul
[Verse 2]
I've got to know (I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know)
(I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know)
I'm sharp enough to focus
Sharp enough to knife
I'm sharp enough to pull through, seraphic bite
Kicking and scratching and wordlessly acting
And not making very nice
Does control drag you out? (You out)
Bе still the ides
[Chorus]
Tyger, tygеr
Along that wire, prowl
For that elysian soul, I've got to know
Fang to fang
Bang your gold
For that elysian soul[Outro]
Fang to fang (I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know)
Bang your gold (I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know)
Tyger, tyger (I've got to know, I've got to know, I've got to know)
Along that wire
