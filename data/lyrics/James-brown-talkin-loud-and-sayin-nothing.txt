Like a dull knife
Just ain't cutting
Just talking loud
Then saying nothing
Just saying nothing
Just saying nothing
You can't tell me
How to run my life down
You can't tell me
How to keep my business sound
You can't tell me
What I'm doing wrong
When you keep jiving
And singing that same old funny song
You can't tell me which way to go
'Cause three times seven
And then some more
You can't tell me, hey
You're like a dull knife
Just ain't cutting
You're just talking loud
And saying nothing
Just saying nothing
Just saying nothing
Don't tell me how to do my thing
When you can't, can't, can't do your own
Don't tell me how to be a boy
When, when you know I'm grown
Can't use me like a woman
When she throws away her dress
And you can't tell me, hey, haha
How to use my mess
You're like a dull knife, Jack
You just ain't cutting
You're just talking loud
Then saying nothing
Just saying nothing
And saying nothing
Shape up your bag
Don't worry 'bout mine
My thing together
And I'm doing fine
Good luck to you
Mister Loud and Wrong

How to run my life down

How to keep my business sound
