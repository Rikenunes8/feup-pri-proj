I gave it all away that night, it was taking a little time, oh
I gave it all I got but now you better know that I know for sure, oh

You made my bed, dealt with it when the lights went out
Now looking back for temporary nothings
But I bet on it, you'll all be here when the lights come out
Still looking for nothing

I gave it all I got to know now
I don't want no part of it no longer, no longer
Looked around this place enough to know now
I don't want to waste the time to know you, to know you
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me

Now, I don't want to bite the hand that'll show me the other side, no
But I didn't want to build the land that has fed you your whole life, no
Don't you find it funny?

You made my bed, dealt with it when the lights went out
Now looking back for temporary nothings
But I bet on it, you'll all be here when the lights come out
Still looking for nothing

I gave it all I got to know now
I don't want no part of it no longer, no longer
Looked around this place enough to know now
I don't want to waste the time to know you, to know you

Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna wait
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna wait

Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
