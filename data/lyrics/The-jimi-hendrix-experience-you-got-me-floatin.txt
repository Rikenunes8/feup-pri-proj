[Verse 1]
Well, you got me floating round and round
Always up, you never let me down
The amazing thing, you turn me on naturally
And I kiss you when I please
[Chorus]
You got me floating round and round
(Got me floating, round and round)
You got me floating never down
(Hey! Touch the ceiling babe)
You got me floating naturally
(Got me floating, naturally)
You got me floating float to please
(Yeah, now you)
[Verse 2]
You got me floating across and through
You make me float right on up to you
There's only one thing
I need to really get me there
Is to hear you laugh without a care
What I say now
[Chorus]
You got me floating round and round
(Hey!, Round and round)
You got me floating never down
(Got me floating, Woah hey!)
You got me floating naturally
(Got me floating, naturally)
You got me floating float to please
(You got me floating)
[Instrumental break 1:15-1:41]
[Chorus]
You got me floating round and round
(Hey, one time I gotta say it)
You got me floating never down
(Got me floating, yeah)
You got me floating naturally
(See the sky)
You got me floating float to please[Verse 3]
Now your daddy's cool
And your mama's no fool
They both know
I'm heads over heels for you
And when the day melts
Down into a sleepy red glow
That's when my desires start to show
[Outro]
You got me floating
(Hey! Hey!)
You got me floating
(Got me floating)
You got me floating
(Touch the sky)
You got me floating
(Got me floating)
You got me floating
(Yeah, hey-hey)
You got me floating
(Got me floating yeah)
You got me floating
(Yeah! Hey!)
You got me floating
(I told you)
You got me floating
