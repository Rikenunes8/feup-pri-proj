[Intro]
Yo, this song, yo
This song is for all the women out there
That have been lied to by their men
And I know y'all been lied to over and over again
This is for y'all, yo, maybe you didn't break
The way you should've broke, yo
But I break, you know I'm sayin'?
So this is how it goes yo
Psst... damn
Yo
[Verse 1]
Last year, Valentine's Day, you would just warmly say
"Babe I love you, love you, babe I swear" (Yo, he's lying)
Held you when you were sick, even...
The whole time I'd think to myself, this isn't fair
[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see? You don't come home to me (No! Oh no!)
When you don't come home to me, can't deal, can't bear (Man)
You keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat
 and you're (Bitch!) caught out there
[Chorus]
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
[Verse 2]
So sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames
And watch it blow up, blow up - tell me, how you gonna see her now?
So far from sincere, fabrications in my ear 
(I love you)
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down
[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see? You don't come home to me (I don't believe this!)
When you don't come home to me, I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise
Look, I hope you're happy since you're caught out there[Interlude]
Yeah, you've been caught
Yo, come on
Come on
[Chorus]
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
[Verse 3]
She's so raunchy, so vulgar; not me, why the hell her?
Look, she dresses a mess, what do you see? (Look at her! I don't know)
It's not all about cash, nor how much you flash (Hell no)
How I dress is a reflection of me
[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see? You don't come home to me (Uh-uh)
When you don't come home to me, can't deal, can't bear (Told you I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise
Look I got something for y'all since you're caught out there
[Chorus]
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
I hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!
