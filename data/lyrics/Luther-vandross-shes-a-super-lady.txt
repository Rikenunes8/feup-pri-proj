[Chorus]
She's a super lady
She is too much
Wish I could make her mine
What a super lady
A-ha, alright
She's so fine
She's a super lady
She is too much
Wish I could make her mine
What a super lady
A-ha, alright
She's so fine
[Verse 1]
Not long ago I was a sad and lonely boy
Did not know how to get better
Then heaven up above sent me a super love
And now I'm happy forever
No one wants to believe I've got a perfect love
They say I'm just talking crazy
But I can prove it's true if you'll allow me to
Tell you about my super lady
[Pre-Chorus]
She's all that I could ask for
She's more than a dream
She's my everything
[Chorus]
She's a super lady
She is too much
Wish I could make her mine
(Well well well)
What a super lady
A-ha, alright
She's so fine
She's a super lady
She is too much
Wish I could make her mine
What a super lady
A-ha, alright
She's so fine[Verse 2]
Whoever thought I would be feeling half this good
The world for me is new place
I'll drink to happiness because our love's the best
The wine for me has a new taste
I'll let my lady know I'll never let her go
Forever I'm gonna hold on
She said she feel's the same, don't wanna play no game
Just wants our love to live on and on
[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could fly to the sky and write out her name
Climb to the top of the world and loudly exclaim
She's my everything
(She's my everything)
(Ooh-ooh) I love (That super lady)
(Ooh-ooh) I love (That super lady)
(Ooh-ooh) I love (That super lady)
(Ooh-ooh) I love (That super lady)
[Outro]
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
She's much, too much
She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart
