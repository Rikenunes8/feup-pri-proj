[Verse 1]
Now I see his face, I see his smile
Such a lonely place, no golden mile
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part
[Chorus]
See his face, see his smile
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh
[Verse 2]
Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns
[Chorus]
See his face, see his smile
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh
[Verse 3]
I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die
[Chorus]
See his face, see his smile
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh
