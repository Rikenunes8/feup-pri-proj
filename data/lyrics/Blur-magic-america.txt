[Verse 1]
Bill Barrett has a simple dream
He calls it his Plan B
There were buildings in the sky
 and the air is sugar free
And everyone is very friendly
Plan B arrived on a holiday
Took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate 'til he could do neither any more
Then found love on Channel 44
[Chorus]
La, la-la-la-la, he wants to go to magic America
La, la-la-la-la, he'd like to live in magic America
With all those magic people
[Verse 2]
Bill Barrett sent his postcards home
To everyone he'd ever known they read
Fifty-nine cents gets you a good square meal
From the people who care how you feel
[Chorus]
La, la-la-la-la, he wants to go to magic America
La, la-la-la-la, he'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people
With all the magic people
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
La, la-la-la-la, he wants to go to magic America
La, la-la-la-la, he'd like to live in magic America
La, la-la-la-la, so nice to be in magic America
La, la-la-la-la, he'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people
With all the magic people
With all the magic people
With all the magic people
[Outro]
All the magic people, all the people
All the people, all the people
All the people, all the people
All the people, all the people
