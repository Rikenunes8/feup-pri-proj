[Chorus]
I'm in love, yes I am
I'm in love, yes I am, uh
I'm in love, hey baby, hey, you know I am
I'm in love, uh, huh, you know I am
[Verse 1]
Friends all wonder what's come over me
I'm as happy as any girl could be
[Chorus]
(Love, love, love) I'm in love
(Love, love, love) believe me I am
(Love, love, love) I'm in love, oh
(Love, love, love) yes sir I am, yes sir I am, yes sir I am
(Love, love, love) hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Love, love, love) I'm in love
[Verse 2]
And I'm so glad that it's me who had to change
I'm sprouting and blooming like the last summer rose
[Chorus]
(Love, love, love) I'm in love
(Love, love, love) I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
(Love, love, love) I'm in love, I'm in
(Love, love, love)
[Outro]
I'm in love
(Love, in love, in love)
In the morning
(In love, in love, in love, in love)
I wake up smiling and shining
(Love, in love, in love) I'm in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)
Smiling like love I know where itâ€™s at
(Love, in love, in love) I'm in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love)
I'm in love
(Love, in love, in love) I'm in love
(In love, in love, in love, in love) yes I am
(Love, in love, in love) um, I'm in love
