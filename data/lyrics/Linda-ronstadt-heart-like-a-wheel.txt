[Verse 1]
Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
But my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
[Verse 2]
When harm is done, no love can be won
I know it happens frequently
What I can't understand, oh please, God, hold my hand
Why it had to happen to me
[Bridge]
And it's only love
And it's only love
That can wreck a human being
And turn him inside-out
[Verse 1]
Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
But my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
