I found a reason to keep living
And the reason dear is you
I found a way to make it all stop repeating
And the reason dear is you
Oh I do believe if you don't like things you leave
For some place you've never been before
I found a reason to keep living
And the reason dear is you
I found a reason to keep singing
And the reason dear is you
Oh I do believe that you are what you precede
What comes is better than what came before
I found a reason to keep living
And the reason dear is you
I found a reason to keep singing
And the reason dear is you
Oh I do believe that you are what you precede
What comes is better than what came before
