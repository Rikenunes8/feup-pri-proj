[Intro]
La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
[Verse 1]
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool
[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold
[Verse 2]
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warm in yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand
[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold
[Verse 3]
See my eyes, my windowpane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of the summer day
[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold[Outro]
La la la la la la [repeat]
