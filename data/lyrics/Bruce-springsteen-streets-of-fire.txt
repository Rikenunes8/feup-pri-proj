[Verse 1]
When the night's quiet and you don't care anymore
And your eyes are tired and there's someone at your door
And you realize you wanna let go
And the weak lies and the cold walls you embrace
Eat at your insides and, baby, I ainâ€™t no liar, I walk
[Chorus]
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
[Verse 2]
Now I'm wandering, the loser down the track
And I'm lyin' but, babe, I can't go back
'Cause in the darkness I hear somebody call my name
And when you realize how they tricked you this time
And it's all lies but I'm strung out on the wire
In these
[Chorus]
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I live now, only with strangers
I talk to only strangers
I walk with angels that have no place
And so don't look at my face
Don't, don't come around my place
'Cause I'm strung out on the wire
 'cross
[Chorus]
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
