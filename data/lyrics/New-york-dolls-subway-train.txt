I can't ever understand
Why my life's, been cursed, poisoned, condemned
When I been tryin', every night, to hold y'near me
But I'm tellin you, it ain't easy
Ever since I been ridin'
Ride on the subway train
You can hear the whistle blowin'
Y'might think I'm insane
And now your friends, they're fillin' up my car
But you're so busy readin' Suzy Says, y'can't look now
You didn't see your lovers, they're all dressed in rags
Y'know y'hid as pushin' up posies, tryin' get y'fed
We was all ridin'
Ride on the subway train
And you can hear the captain shoutin'
He thinks I've gone insane
'Cause I keep ridin'
Keep on ridin'
'Cause I keep on ridin', ridin', ridin'
Keep on ridin', yeah
You stop and you stare as I'm leavin' my favorite place
We have no regards, y'can't find a trace
Y'gotta get on back to daddy, tat's all it's gonna be
He got the poison black arts of the pimps, but don't y'st- st-
I seen 'em travelin'
Ride on the subway train
Y'can hear the captain shoutin'
He thinks we've all gone insane
'Cause we keep on ridin', ridin', ridin', ridin'
'Cause we keep ridin', ridin', ridin'
Keep on ridin'
I think I see the train, I see y'got open track
I'm hopin' one of those gonna bring my baby backDinah, won't y'blow
Dinah, won't y'blow your horn
Dinah, won't y'blow
Dinah, won't y'blow your horn
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
I know whoa whoa whoa
I said someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
I know
I keep on ridin', ridin', ridin'
