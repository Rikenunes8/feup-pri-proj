[Verse 1]
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel, but love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart, but love me (won't you love me)
[Verse 2]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
[Chorus]
I would beg and steal (beg and steal)
Just to feel (just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (so close to mine)
[Verse 3]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only (ooh)
[Chorus]
I would beg and steal (he would beg and steal)
Just to feel (yes, just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (so close to mine)
[Verse 4]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah
