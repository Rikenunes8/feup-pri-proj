[Verse 1]
Just a perfect day
Drink Sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark we go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie too and then home
[Chorus]
Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
[Verse 2]
Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own, it's such fun
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else, someone good
[Chorus]
Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
[Outro]
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
