[Verse 1]
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page
I was meaning to send to you
I couldn’t tell if it’d bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you
[Chorus]
But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you
[Verse 2]
All I can be is a busy sea
Of spinning wheels and hands that feel for
Stones to throw and feet that run but
Come back home
It made no difference
Ever known, it made no difference
Ever known to me
[Chorus]
But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you
[Verse 3]
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page
I was meaning to send to you
I couldn’t tell if it’d bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you
[Chorus]
But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
If I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you[Outro]
I’m the man who loves you
I’m the man who loves you
I’m the man who loves you
I’m the man who loves you
