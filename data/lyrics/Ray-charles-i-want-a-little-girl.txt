[Verse]
I want a little girl to call my own
She must be someone who's all alone now
I say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yea
You know I want a little girl, she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book
But if she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a tee, now
Oh, she don't have to wave her hair
Or wear fancy clothes and I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear nylon hose, oh
'Cause I want a little girl to love a lot
I say I'd give her everything I've got, now
Because I want a little girl to fall in love with me, yeah
