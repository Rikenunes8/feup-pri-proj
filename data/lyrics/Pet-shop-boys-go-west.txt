This is what we're gonna do
Go west
[Verse 2]

I love you

When you say
) You will do the rest

(
Go west, this is what we're gonna do
)[Bridge]
There where the air is free
We'll be what we want to be
(
We'll be
)
Now if we make a stand
We'll find our promised land
(
We'll find
)
[Verse 3]
(
I know that
) There are many ways
(
To live there
) In the sun or shades
(
Together
) We will find a place
(
To settle
) Where there's so much space
(
Without rush
) And the pace back east
(
The hustling
) Rustling just to feed
(
I know I'm)
 Ready to leave too
(
So that's what
) We are gonna do
[Chorus]
(
What we're gonna do is go west
) Life is peaceful there
(
Go west
) Here in the open air
(
Go west
) Where the skies are blue
(
Go west
) This is what we're gonna do
[Chorus]
(
Life is peaceful there
)
Go west (
In the open air
)
Go west (
Baby, you and me
)
Go west (
This is our destiny
)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
(
Go west
) 
Sun in winter time
(
Go west
) We will feel just fine
(
Go west
) Where the skies are blue
(
Go west
) This is what we're gonna do
(
Come on, come on, come on, come on, go west
