[Verse 1: Björn & Benny]
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ah...
[Chorus: Björn, Benny, 
Agnetha & Frida
]
"Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help some day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road that we're going
(On the road)
We all need words of comfort and compassion
(We all need)
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way"
[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Ah...
[Chorus: 
Björn, Benny,
 Agnetha & Frida]
"Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)
You might need his help one day (He's your brother)
We depend on one another (Brother)
Love him, that's the only way
On the road that we're going
(On the road that we're going)
We all need words of comfort and compassion
(We all need words of comfort and compassion)
Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)
Love him, that's the only way"
[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)
You might need his help one day (He's your brother)
We depend on one another (Brother)
Love him, that's the only way
Treat him well, he is your brother (Brother)
You might need his help one day (He's your brother)
We depend on one another... (Brother)
