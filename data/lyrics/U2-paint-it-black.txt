[Verse 1]
I see a red door
And I want to paint it black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Cruelly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day
[Verse 3]
I look inside myself
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I wanna paint it black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up
When your whole world is black[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes
[Outro]
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as coal
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as coal
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as coal
