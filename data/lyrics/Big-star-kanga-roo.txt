I first saw you, you had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide anything
I saw you breathing, oh
I saw you staring out in space
I next saw you, you was at the party
Thought you was a queen, oh so flirty
I came against, didn't say excuse
Knew what I was doing
We looked very fine cause we were leaving
Like Saint Joan doing a cool jerk
Oh, I want you like a kangaroo
