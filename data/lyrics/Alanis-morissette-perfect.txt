[Verse 1]
Sometimes is never quite enough
If you're flawless, then you'll win my love
Don't forget to win first place
Don't forget to keep that smile on your face
[Chorus]
Be a good boy
Try a little harder
You've got to measure up
Make me prouder
[Verse 2]
How long before you screw it up?
And how many times do I have to tell you
To hurry up?
With everything I do for you
The least you can do is keep quiet
[Chorus]
Be a good girl
You gotta try a little harder
That simply wasn't good enough
To make us proud
[Bridge]
I'll live through you
I'll make you what I never was
If you're the best, then maybe so am I
Compared to him, compared to her
I'm doing this for your own damn good
You'll make up for what I blew
What's the problem? Why are you crying?[Chorus]
Be a good boy
Push a little farther now
That wasn't fast enough
To make us happy
We'll love you just the way you are
If you're perfect
