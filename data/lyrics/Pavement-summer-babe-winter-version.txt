[Verse 1]
Ice, baby
I saw your girlfriend, and she was
Eating her fingers like they're just another meal
But she waits there
In the levee washes
Mixin' cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar
[Verse 2]
My eyes stick to all the shiny robes
You wear on the protein delta strip
In an abandoned houseboat
I will wait there
I'll be waiting forever
I'm waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waiting
Go
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Minerals, ice deposit daily
Drop off the first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things I want to sell, but
Not here, babe
You took 'em all
[Chorus]
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I turn around, my friend
Every time I sit around, my friend
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time, you're my
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
