[Verse 1]
I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just wanna make love to you
[Chorus]
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you
[Verse 2]
All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you
[Chorus]
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you
[Bridge]
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I could give you all the loving in the whole wide world
[Verse 3]
All I want you to do is to bake your bread
Just to make sure that you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
[Chorus]
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you, ooh
[Bridge]
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I could give you all the loving in the whole wide world[Verse 4]
Oh, all I wanna do, all I wanna do is cook your bread
Just to make sure that you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
[Chorus]
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Real love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you, ooh
