[Intro]
Oh, you're divine
Oh, you're divine
[Verse 1]
Oh, oh
Did I tell you you're divine?
Oh, oh, oh
Did I ever when you were alive?
[Chorus 1]
Did it hurt when you bled?
Did it, 
oh lover boy, oh fever head?
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth, my love, was open wide
[Verse 2]
Singing oh
You were going to be my life, dammit!
Oh, oh, oh
You were going to be my life
[Chorus 2]
Did you sing happy day?
Sing it, sing it that time I went away?
Got to ease my aching head
Ooh, no, no other way, cut off your legs
[Bridge]
Oh
Oh
[Chorus 3]
Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy, oh fever head?
No you must, no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again?
And I, I might as well be dead
[Outro]
But I could kill you instead
