Baby
You shouldn't keep your kisses all to yourself
Don't you know?
Got to share those kisses with someone else
And you got to be kissed someday
But before you give them all away

Let me have some
Oh, let me have some
Ha, darlin'
You can't keep your huggin' and squeezin' just for you
Oh, don't you know?
If you do this, it will only make you blue
You should be huggin' somebody tight now
And I'm puttin' my bid in right now

Let me have some
Baby, let me have some

Well, now, huggin' and kissin' ain't all you're missin'
Stop tryin' to be so cold
You're missin' happy days so change your ways
Before you get too old

Sweet baby
You just can't let all your time be your own
Ooh, don't you know?
Time is wasted when it's spent all alone
Ah, if you can spare a little bit of your time
Ha, I wanna try and make you mine
Ah, let me have some
Ah, a little bit of your time (Oh, let me have some)
Blow your horn, pretty cutie

Oh, pretty cutie
You just can't let all your time be your own
Ah, don't you know?
Time is wasted when it's spent all alone, yeah
If you can spare a little bit of your time
Come on, 'cause I wanna try and make you mine

Ah, let me have some
Just a little bit of your time (Oh, let me have some)
I wanna try to make you mine (Oh, let me have some)
Oh baby, ba-baby (Oh, let me have some)
Ah, let me have some
Let me have some
