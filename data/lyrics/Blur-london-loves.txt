[Verse 1]
A malady has taken him over
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor
The lights are magic and he feels lucky
And he's got money, shoots like an arrow, oh
[Chorus]
London loves the mystery of a speeding car
London loves the misery of a
 
speeding heart
[Verse 2]
It's love you like and everyone's at it
And 
words are cheap when the mind is elastic
He loves the violence, keeps ticking over
So sleep together before today is sold forever
[Chorus]
London loves the way people just fall apart
London loves
 the way you just don't stand a chance
London loves the mystery of a speeding car
[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
[Chorus]
London loves the mystery of a speeding car
London loves the mystery of a speeding heart
London loves the mystery
(Hey, hey) London loves the way people just fall apart
London loves the way we just don't stand a chance
London loves a speeding heart
[Outro]
