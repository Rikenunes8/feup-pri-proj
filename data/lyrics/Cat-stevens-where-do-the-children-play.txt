[Verse 1]
Well I think it's fine
Building jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Yes, get what you want to if you want
'Cause you can get anything
[Chorus]
I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?
[Verse 2]
Well, you roll on roads
Over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads
Pumping petrol gas
And you make them long
And you make them tough
But they just go on and on
And it seems that you can't get off
[Chorus]
Oh, I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?[Verse 3]
Well you've cracked the sky
Scrapers fill the air
But will you keep on building higher
'til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live
Will you tell us when to die?
I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?
