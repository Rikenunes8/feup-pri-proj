[Intro]
Il me plaît d'être avec toi
Je ne sais pas où
Où le temps s'est enfui
Oh je t'aime mon chéri
[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're having fun
Ooh, baby
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (Fun)
Oh, baby
[Verse 1]
I don't know where it all went
Time passed us by
Just when it seemed the fun began
Ooh
[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're having fun, please stay
Funny how time flies (Please stay) when you're having fun, mmm
[Verse 2]
But time never ends
Let's find the time
To get together once again, someday soon
[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're having fun, mmm, yeah, ooh
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (Fun)
[Bridge]
Don't you ever leave (Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Don't you ever go
Say you love me so (Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Mmm
[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (When you're having fun, yeah)
Funny how time flies when you're having fun[Outro]
Je ne sais pas où le temps s'est enfui
Il me plaît d'être avec toi
I really don't know where all the time went
I really have to go
Stop, stop
Oh, I really have to go
Oh, I really have to go
One more time?
Oh je t'aime mon chéri
Oh, oh, oh
Š'il vous plaît
Š'il vous plaît
