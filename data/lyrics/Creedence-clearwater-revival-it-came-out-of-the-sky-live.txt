Oh, it came out of the sky
Landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor
Couldn't believe what he seen
Laid on the ground and shook
Fearin' for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screamin'
"It came out of the sky"
Well, a crowd gathered 'round
And a scientist said, "It was marsh gas"
A spirit came to make a speech
About raisin' the Mars tax
The Vatican said, "Woe, the Lord has come"
Hollywood rushed out an epic film
An' Ronnie the popular said, "It was a communist plot"
Oh
Oh, the newspaper came
And made Jody a national hero
Walter and Eric said
They'd put him on a network TV show
The White House said
"Put the thing in the Blue Room"
The Vatican said, "No, it belongs to Rome"
And Jody said, "It's mine but you can have it for seventeen million"
Oh, it came out of the sky
Landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor
Couldn't believe what he's seen
Laid on the ground a shakin'
Fearin' for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screamin'
"It came out of the sky"
Oh
