[Verse 1]
Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am
But in my heart there is a shower
I hope she'll be happier with him
[Verse 2]
Maybe the darkness of the hour
Makes me seem lonelier than I am
But over the darkness I have no power
Hope she'll be happier with him
[Bridge]
I can't believe that she don't want to see me
We lived and loved with each other so long
I never thought that she really would leave me
But she's gone
[Outro]
Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am
But in my heart there is a shower
Hope she'll be happier with him
