[Verse 1]
I learn my name
I write with a number two pencil
I work up to my potential
I earn my name
[Verse 2]
I come when called
I jump when you circle the cherry
I sing like a good canary
I come when called
I come, that's all
[Chorus]
Send it up on fire
Deaf before dumb
Send it up on fire
Deaf before dumb
[Verse 3]
I clean the house
I put all your books in an order
I make up a colorful border
I clean my mouth
Cause froth comes out[Chorus]
Send it up on fire
Deaf before dumb
Send it up on fire
Deaf before dumb
