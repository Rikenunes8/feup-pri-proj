Now you've gone, I'm all alone
My heart is broken and I don't wanna go home
You know it's all over, you're out of luck
You feel so low you wanna self-destruct
I needed you and you loved me too
But now I don't know what I'm gonna do
But life moves on, I'm talking history
And now I've got to find someone who'll dance with me
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
[Bridge: Chris Lowe]
You, you were my lover
You were my hope, you were my dreams, my life
My passion, my love, my sex and my money
My violence, religion, injustice and death
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
Paninaro, Paninaro, oh, oh, oh
