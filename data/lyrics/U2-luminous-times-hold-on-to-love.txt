[Chorus]
Hey sister love
Hey sister sun
Hey oh my love
You turn me around tonight
Hey sister love
[Verse 1]
Save my soul
Save my soul
Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Love won't to let you go
Love won't to let you go
Hold on to love
See the sunshine in her soul
[Chorus]
Hey sister love
Hey sister sun
[Verse 2]
She come likes carnival
She is the big wheel
She turn my head around
Turn my head around
She is the speedway
She is the slipstream
She is coming round
[Chorus]
Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Love won't to let you go
Hold on to love
Hold on to love
[Bridge]
See the sunlight in her soul
See the sunlight in her soul
[Verse 3]
She is the gun fire
She is the car crash
She is the avalanche
She is the thunder
She is the waves and
She pulls me under[Verse 4]
I love you cause I need to
Not because I need you
I love you cause I understand
That God had given me your hand
Holds me in a tiny fist
And still I need your kiss
[Chorus]
Hold on to love
See the sunlight in her soul
See the sunlight in her soul
