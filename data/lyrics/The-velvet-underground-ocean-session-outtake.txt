[Verse 1]
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Where have they been?
Silver and black with night
Here's to a summer's night
An empty splendid castle
Glowering alone at night
The princess has had a fright
Madness seeks out of lover
And here come the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the soul of the body
That comes from the depth of the sea
[Verse 2]
Here come the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Where have they been?
Don't spend tonight my love
The tide is out my love
Malcolm's curse haunts our family
Odious loud in which
Ruler of filthy seas
Revel in heaven's justice
And here come the waves
And save for a scream
There's much like a song
To be heard in the wind
That blows by the sea
Like the wind
[Outro]
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
