[Intro]
(Crank the music up)
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with 
massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh
[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back
[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back
[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
[Interlude 1]
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude 2]
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh
[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
[Bridge]
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Uh! Yeah
[Outro]
Take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on, take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on, uh! Yeah
