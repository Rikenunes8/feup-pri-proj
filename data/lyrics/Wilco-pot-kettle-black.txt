[Verse 1]
Crazy rides rockets
Where's your magic wand?
Empty out your pockets
Words without a song
I, myself, have found a real rival in myself
I am hoping for a re-arrival of my health
[Verse 2]
Sleeping eye sockets
Baby, suck your thumb
I'll keep you in my locket
A string I never strum
It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself
[Chorus]
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
[Verse 3]
Lazy locomotives
Wherever you may roll
I think you have no motive
I know you have no home
It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself[Chorus]
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
[Outro]
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
