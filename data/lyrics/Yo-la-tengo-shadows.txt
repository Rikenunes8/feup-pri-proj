Scold me, that's all you've got to say
Coldly, hurt me and turn away
You say I'm not sorry that
I'm resigned to what is next
I head for the shadows
Hold me, taking it back through tears
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears
But I've got myself to protect
It's too soon for me to forget
I wait in the shadows
In the shadows, though I am alone
They help me see that I'm the only
One in your heart
So until I truly believe
That your words convey what you mean
I wait in the shadows
I wait in the shadows
I don't mind the shadows
