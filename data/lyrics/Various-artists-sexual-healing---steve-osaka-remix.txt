Oh, baby now let's get down tonight (ba-ba-ba, bum)
Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven (heal me my darling, heal me my darling)
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer (heal me my darling, heal me my darling)
It's getting stronger and stronger
When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby
And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
'Cause you do it right
Baby, I got sick this mornin' (heal me my darling, heal me my darling)
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'(heal me my darling, heal me my darling)
The waves are risin' and risin'
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, oh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
I'll be feeling fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate
(Heal me my darling)
(Heal me my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling (heal me my darling)
I need sexual healing
Oh, when I get this feeling (heal me my darling)
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling (heal me my darling)
'Cause I'm all alone
I need Sexual healing, darling (heal me my darling)
'Til you come back home (heal me my darling)
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate
