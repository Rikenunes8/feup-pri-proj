[Verse 1]
Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea
They pull out of here
They pull, they are free
[Verse 2]
Rode a horse around the world
Along the tracks of a train
Broke the record, found the gold
Set myself free again
[Chorus]
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
[Verse 3]
Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea
On the tracks of a train
Set myself free again
[Chorus]
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
