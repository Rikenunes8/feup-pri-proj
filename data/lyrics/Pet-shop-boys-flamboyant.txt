[Verse 1]
You live in a world of excess
Where more is more
And less is much less
A day without fame
Is a waste
And a question of need
Is a question of taste
[Chorus 1]
And you're so flamboyant
The way you look
It gets you so much attention
Your sole employment
Is getting more
You want police intervention
You're so flamboyant
The way you live
You really care that they stare
And the press deployment
Is always there
It's what you do for enjoyment
[Verse 2]
You live in a time of decay
When the worth of a man
Is how much he can play
Every day
All the public must know
Where you are, what you do
'Cause your life is a show and
[Chorus 2]
You're so flamboyant
The way you live
And it's not even demeaning
You're so flamboyant
It's like a drug
You use to give your life meaning
You're so flamboyant
The way you look
It gets you so much attention
Your sole employment
Is getting more
You want police intervention
[Bridge]
Every actor needs
An audience
Every action is
A performance
It all takes courage
You know it
Just crossing the street
Well, it's almost heroic
You're so flamboyant[Verse 3]
There you are
At another preview
In a pose
The artist and you
To look so loud
May be considered tacky
Collectors wear black clothes by Issey Miyake
[Chorus 1]
You're so flamboyant
The way you look
It gets you so much attention
Your sole employment
Is getting more
You want police intervention
You're so flamboyant
The way you live
You really care that they stare
And the press deployment
Is always there
It's what you do for enjoyment
[Outro]
You're so flamboyant
Flamboyant
