[Verse 1]
Kool Thing sitting with a kitty
Now you know you're sure looking pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a little chance here
[Chorus]
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
[Verse 2]
Kool Thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
[Chorus]
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
[Bridge: 
Chuck D
 & Kim Gordon]
Yeah, tell 'em about it
Hit 'em where it hurts
Hey, Kool Thing, come here
Sit down beside me
There's something I got to ask you
I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is
Huh?
Yeah
Don't be shy
Word up
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby
I just want to know that we can still be friends
Let everybody know
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Kool thing, kool thingWhen you're a star, I know that you'll fix everything
[Verse 3]
Kool thing sitting with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master
[Chorus]
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
[Verse 4]
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
What'd he say?
[Chorus]
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
