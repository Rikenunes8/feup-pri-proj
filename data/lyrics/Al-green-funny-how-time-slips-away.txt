[Intro]
Time, time, time, time
[Verse 1]
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long time
How am I doin'?
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long and it seems like
It was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away
[Verse 2]
How's your new love?
I hope he's doin' fine, oh yeah
I heard you told him, told him
You're gonna love him 'til the end of time
But, if I remember, that's the same thing, same thing
That you told me, it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time just slips away
[Bridge]
I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you somewhere around, somewhere around
Uh-huh, but, oh, you don't know, you never know
We don't know, you can't know when I'll be back in town
Remember what I told you
That in time you're gonna pay
Well, ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
All I want you to do is just, just remember what I told you
In time, in time, you're gonna pay
Yeah, ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
[Outro]
One thing I want you to do
Is just remember, remember what I told you
In time, in time, hey
Ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
Ooh baby, oh baby
It's the same thing, same thing that you told me
Oh, it seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
Funny thing about the time, baby
It's funny, baby, how time slips away
Ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
