[Verse 1]
I can't do a thing today
I can't see anyway
I haven't eaten all day
[Chorus]
In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
[Verse 2]
I can't listen to what you say
I can't understand you anyway
I haven't spoken all day
[Chorus]
In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
[Verse 3]
Felling good, felling bad
Felling happy, felling sad
I'm so happy, happy sad
[Chorus]
In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
[Outro]
I don't (?) your feelings
I do not need you
