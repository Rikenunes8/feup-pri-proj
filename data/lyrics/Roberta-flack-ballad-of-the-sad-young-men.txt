[Verse 1]
Sing a song of sad young men
Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again
Kiss your dreams goodbye
[Bridge]
All the sad young men
Sitting in the bars
Drinking up the nights
And missing all the stars
All the sad young men
Drifting through the town
Drinking up the night
Trying not to drown
All the sad young men
Singing in the cold
Trying to forget
That they are growing old
All the sad young men
Choking on their youth
Trying to be brave
Running from the truth
[Verse 2]
Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part
[Outro]
All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold
For just a little while
Tired little girl
She does the best, she does the best that she can
Trying to be gay
For a sad young man
While a grimy moon
Blossoms up above
All the sad young men
They play at making love, at making love
Misbegotten moon
Shine for sad young men
May your gentle light
Guide them home again
All the sad, sad, sad young men
