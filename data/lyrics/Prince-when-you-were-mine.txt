[Verse 1]
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
It was just like a train
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (So fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so
[Chorus]
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine
[Verse 2]
When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind (So blind)
I let you fool around
I never cared (Didn't care)
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping in between the two of us
[Chorus]
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine[Bridge]
When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you
[Chorus]
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine
[Outro]
When you were mine, yeah, oh no
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
When you were mine
