[Intro]
[Verse 1]
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
Just depends on what kind of car you are
[Chorus 1]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[Verse 2]
I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not
[Chorus 2]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mad or not
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[Bridge]
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends
And don't you know - I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friends they're at the bar
La la laaaaaaa[Verse 1]
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
Just depends on what kind of car you are
[Chorus 1]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[Chorus 1]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[Chorus 1]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la[Outro]
