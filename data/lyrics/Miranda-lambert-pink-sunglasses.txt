[Verse 1]
I put 'em on whenever I sit down to read the paper
Can't explain the way they seem to work like magic
I put 'em on to keep it positive
Don't mean to tell you how to feel
But I'm a firm believer in the power of the plastic
Positive plastic
[Chorus 1]
In my pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try 'em anytime you need a change of the weather
For $9.99, I'm perfectly disguised
When I'm walking by, I wanna roll my eyes
In my pink sunglasses, pink sunglasses
[Verse 2]
I was looking for some tortoise shells
But these were on sale next to the disposable cameras
Tried 'em on and suddenly, it occurred to me
That buying Little Debbies felt a little more glamorous
In the checkout line, don't I look good?
[Chorus 1]
In my pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try 'em anytime you need a change of the weather
For $9.99, I'm perfectly disguised
When I'm walking by, I wanna roll my eyes
In my pink sunglasses, pink sunglasses
[Bridge]
I could leave 'em on a beach, at a bar, on the boat
But they always reappear in the pocket of my coat
I can't find 'em, they always find me
[Chorus 2]
My pink sunglasses
Always makes the world look a little bit better
In my pink sunglasses
You can try 'em anytime you need a change of the weather
For $9.99, I'm completely polarized
Sometimes, I accidentally go to bed at night
In my pink sunglasses, pink sunglasses[Outro]
Pink sunglasses
In my pink sunglasses
Pink sunglasses
