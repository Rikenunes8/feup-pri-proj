[Verse 1]
Oh shit, I thought you and I were friends
Oh shit, I guess this is where our love ends
Oh shit, I thought things were goin' well
But it hasn't turned out so swell
Has it? Oh shit
[Verse 2]
Oh shit, pride comes before a fall
Oh shit, and once you lose one, you've lost them all
Oh shit, I guess that this time's the time
And it seems you're no longer mine
Don't it? Oh shit, oh shit
Ah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Oh shit, I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit, that you were such a cow
Oh shit, I wouldn't've wasted my time
Oh shit, chasin' somethin' which wasn't mine
Face it, you're shit, you're shit
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Oh shit, I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit, that you were such a fuckin' cow
Oh shit, I wouldn't've wasted my time
Oh shit, chasin' somethin' which could never be mine
[Outro]
Admit, you're shit, you're shit, you're shit
Admit, admit, you're shit, you're shit
You're shit, you're shit, you're shit
