[Verse 1]
How does it feel
When you're left sitting out in the cold?
How does it feel
When you don't have nobody to hold?
[Chorus 1]
I wanna know
Does it really, really hurt you so?
Are you crying?
Are you dying?
Do you want her like I wanted you before?
[Verse 2]
How does it feel
To just stare at the ceiling all night?
How do you feel
Knowing someone is holding her tight?
[Chorus 2]
Please tell me true
Are you really really feeling blue?
Do you miss her?
Wanna kiss her?
Do you need her like I needed you before?
[Bridge]
When you walked out on me
I felt like you're feeling now
But I'd take you back again
'Cause I still love you, anyhow
[Chorus 2]
I wanna know
Does it really really hurt you so?
Are you crying?
Are you dying?
Do you want her like I wanted you before?
