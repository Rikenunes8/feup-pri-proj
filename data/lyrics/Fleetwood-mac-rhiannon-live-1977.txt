[Spoken Intro]
This is a song about a witch
[Verse 1]
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
Rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, yeah,  your life knows no answer
[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
[Verse 1]
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Would you even try?
Would you even try?[Refrain]
