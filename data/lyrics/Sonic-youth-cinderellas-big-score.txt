[Chorus]
If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar
Than a hug from your sis
[Verse 1]
You really fucked up this time
Your old lady's really pissed
She's not just laughing
She's polishing her fist
[Chorus]
If you could give me anything
Would you consider a fist?
Don't give me your soul
It's caught in an abyss
[Verse 2]
Here's a pack of ciggys
Fresh from the wonder lips
A dream, a wish, a heart's desires
Cinderella is a kiss
A cold is going to take you
And freeze away your tears
Come a little closer honey
You can be so near
Mind your heart aside you
Really got no sense of time
Ninety-nine inside you
That I'm scared if you were crying
[Chorus]
If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar
Than a hug from your sis[Outro]
A cold is going to take you
And freeze away your tears
Come a little closer honey
We can be so near
