[Intro]
Are we ready?
A-are we ready, ready? (Yes)
Are we ready?
A-are we ready, ready?
Uh-huh...
[Verse 1]
My body feels like an inferno
Like I'm in a race and I'm jumping a hurdle (It's going so fast)
Come closer, we'll pursue it
If you just let go, we can do it (We can do it)
Baby, I'm yours for the taking
Don't you wanna see my body naked?
I know that you like the way I shake it (uh-huh)
And I hope that you can take it
[Chorus]
You're the perfect lover
I'm in love with all the things you do
So seductive when you touch me
I can't get enough of you
You're the best
Baby, you got me obsessed (Yeah)
And I can't catch my breath
Baby, 
I must confess
 you got me (Ah, ah)
When you come around (Ah, ah)
Got me so damn high, I can't come down
Every time you touch me there (Ah, ah)
You make me feel so hot
[Verse 2]
I love it
Everything you do is so seductive
You got that thing that I want and then some
And I can't even front, so listen
I know what youâ€™re missing
Better hurry up, 'cause time is ticking yeah
Tick tock, tick tock
Come and get me while I'm hot, now
[Chorus]
You're the perfect lover
I'm in love with all the things you do
So seductive when you touch me
I can't get enough of you
You're the best
Baby, you got me obsessed
And I can't catch my breath (Oh)
Baby, 
I must confess

When you come around (Ah, ah)
Got me so damn high, I can't come down
Every time you touch me there (Ah, ah)

Pull up to my bumper
I need a jump, not a chump
Fill me up, I'm running low (Uh-huh)
Let me drive you crazy
All night cause we got so far to go (Here we go)
Pull up to my bumper
I need a jump, not a chump
Fill me up, I'm running low (Uh-huh)
Let me drive you crazy
All night cause we got so far to go (Here we go)
[Chorus]

You're the best
Baby, you got me obsessed
And I can't catch my breath
Baby, 
I must confess

When you come around (Ah, ah)
Got me so damn high, I can't come down
Every time you touch me there (Ah, ah)
You make me feel so hot
