[Intro]
This is a beautiful day
It is a new day
We are together
We are unified, and of one accord
Because together, we got pow-wow
Apart, we got power
Today on this program, you will hear gospel
And rhythm and blues and jazz
All those are just labels
We know that music is music
Today on this program, you will hear gospel
And rhythm and blues and jazz
All those are just labels
We know that music is music
