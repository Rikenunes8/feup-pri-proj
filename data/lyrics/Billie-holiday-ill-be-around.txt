I'll be around no matter how you treat me now
I'll be around from now on
Your latest love can never last and when it's past
I'll be around when she's gone
Goodbye again
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then drop a line
To say you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
And I'll be around when she's gone
Goodbye again
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then drop me a line
Say you're feeling very fine
When things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
And I'll be around when she's gone
When she's gone
