Just old Rambling Bill, just old Rambling Bill
Some day I might get married and, baby, I might settle down
I ain't got no home, I'm here all alone
All the clothes I've got, I've got them on
Just old Rambling Bill, just old Rambling Bill
Some day I might get married and, baby, I might settle down
I've been all around from town to town
I've got some good things on my way around
Just old Rambling Bill, just old Rambling Bill
Some day I might get married and, baby, I might settle down
...Rock it, boys!
I'm just like a piano player, carry nothing but my hat
I play women where I find 'em and leave 'em where I played 'em at
Just old Rambling Bill, just old Rambling Bill
Some day I might get married and, baby, I might settle down
Rocks is my pillow, sunshine keeps me warm
Blue sky is my blanket and Mother Nature built my home
Just old Rambling Bill, just old Rambling Bill
Some day I might get married and, baby, I might settle down
Wash everything I had down the streetI was hollerin' for mercy, and it weren't no boats around
Hey I was hollerin' for mercy, and it weren't no boats around
Hey that looks like people, I've gotta stay right here and drown
Hey my house started shakin', started floatin' on down the stream
Hey my house started shakin', went on floatin' on down the stream
It was dark as midnight, people began to holler and scream
