I can tell by your face that you're looking to find a place
To settle your mind and reveal who you are
And you shouldn't be shy, for I'm not gonna try
To hurt you, or heal you, or steal your star

Open your eyes, get up off your chair
There's so much to do in the sunlight
Give up your secrets and let down your hair
And sit with me here by the firelight
Why think all about who's gonna win out?
We'll make up our story as we go along
There's so little time for us to try to rhyme
And so many highways to travel upon

Open your eyes, get up off your chair
There's so much to do in the sunlight
Give up your secrets and let down your hair
And sit with me here by the firelight
