[Verse 1]
The ink is running
The words are taught
I'm sitting helpless with my paper and charts
I had to follow my passion
[Chorus]
Oh well
[Verse 2]
I don't get paid that much for all I deserve
To waste a sentence or shatter my nerves
I had to follow my passion
[Chorus]
Oh well
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I long to run outside
I'd give it all up but it's my pride
[Chorus]
Oh well
Oh well
I had a dream once or so I thought
I'd be a pilot or an astronaut
I had a dream like that until I found
Even an astronaut goes into the ground
Life is just passing us bye-bye[Chorus]
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
