[Verse]
Why keep on breaking my heart
When it's beating for you
Only you
Why do you toy with my dreams
They're depending on you to come true
When you invaded my mind
You took over complete control
Then I surrender to you
All my dreams, my heart and soul
Please say
There's a chance that some day
You may feel just the way that I do
But why keep on breaking my heart
When it's beating for you
Only you
[Instrumental]
[Outro]
Why keep on breaking my heart
When it's beating for you
Only you
Say, why keep on breaking my heart
When it's beating for you
Only you
