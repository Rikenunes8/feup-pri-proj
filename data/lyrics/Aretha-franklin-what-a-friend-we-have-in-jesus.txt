What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege it is to carry
Everything to God in prayer
Let's do that one more time
What a, what a friend we have, we have in Jesus
All, all our sins and grieves to bear, oh yeah
What a, what a privilege it is to carry
Everything to God in prayer, oh yeah
Oh, oh, what peace we often forfeit
And oh, what needless pain we bear, oh, yes we do
All just because we don't, we just don't carry
Everything, every, every, everything to God in prayer, oh yeah
Oh, oh, what peace we often, we often forfeit
And oh, what needless pain we bear, oh, yes we do
All because we, we just don't carry
Everything, everything, every, every, everything
Everything to Jesus
We need to take it to Jesus, everything
We won't carry our problems in Jesus no more, oh yeah
Everything, oh, every, every, every, every, oh, everything
Every
Everything to God in prayer
It's all because we just don't carry
No, we don't
We don't carry everything
Every, everything
Everything to Jesus
Everything to the Lord
Everything to Jesus
Every, everything
Everything, ooh, to the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
