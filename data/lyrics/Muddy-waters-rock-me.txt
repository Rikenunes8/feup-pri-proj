[Verse]
Want you to rock me baby, rock me all night long[x2]
Well I want you to rock me baby, like my back hasn't got no bones
Sun going down, the moon begin to rise[x2]
Well I want you to rock me baby, till you make me satisfied
See me coming, run get your rocking chair[x2]
Well you know I am not no stranger, you know I used to live right here
Want you to roll me, like I roll a wagon wheel[x2]
You know I want you to roll me over, you know how good that makes me feel
Rock me easy, rock your baby slow[x2]
Well you know I want you to rock me so easy, util I don't want to rock no more
Put your arms around me, like a circle around the sun[x2]
I want you to call, call me daddy, let me lay down in your arms
