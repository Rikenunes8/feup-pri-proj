[Verse]
Please don't tell, no-no-no
Don't say that I told you so
I just heard a rumour from a friend
I don't say that it's true
I'll just leave that up to you
If you don't believe I'll understand
[Chorus][x2]
You recall a girl that's been in nearly every song
This is what I heard, of course the story could be wrong
She's the one, I've been told
Now, she's wearing a band of gold
Peggy Sue got married not long ago
[Outro]
Peggy Sue got married not long ago
