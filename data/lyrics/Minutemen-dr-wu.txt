It don't seem right
Well I been strung out here all night
I'm waiting for the taste you said you'd bring to me
Biscayne Bay
Where the Cuban children
Sleep all day
I'm searching for the song
You used to sing to me
Katy lies
You can see it in her eyes
Imagine my surprise
When I saw you
Are you with me Dr. Wu
Or are you really just a shadow of the man that I once knew?
Are you crazy?
Are you high?
Are you just an ordinary guy?
Have you done all you can do?
Are you with me, doctor?
Can you hear me, doctor?
Are you with me, doctor?
Can you hear me, doctor?
