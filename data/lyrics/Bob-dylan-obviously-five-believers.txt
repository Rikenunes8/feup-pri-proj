[Chorus]
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to
I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you
If I just didn't feel so all alone
[Verse 1]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't
You know I can and I know a honey
But, oh, honey, please don't
[Verse 2]
I got my black dog barkin'
Black dog barkin'
Yes, he is now
Yes, he is
Outside my yard
Yes, I could tell you what he means
If I just didn't have to try so hard
[Verse 3]
Your mama's workin'
Your mama's moanin'
She's cryin', ya know
She's tryin', ya know
Ya better go now
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I
But I just don't know how
[Verse 4]
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers
And five believers
Five believers
All dressed like men
Tell your mama not to worry because
Yes, they're just my friends[Chorus]
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to
I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you, honey
If I just did not feel so all alone
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Come on, come on
