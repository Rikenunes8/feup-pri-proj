Yo
I was fuckin' with, the other day, I was chillin' with Scott
And this nigga was like (
Yeah, yeah, what happened?
)
And the minute we gotta sit in front our crib with a shotgun
'Cause jokers gonna be bustin' up in there tryna get food, clothing, shelter
TVs, forks, radios, whatever they get they hands on, kid
This shit is getting mad ill out here, man (
That shit always happenin', man
)
Jokers running around, like, with masks on (
Man, fuck that, know what I'm sayin'?
)
Until my man Petey think he like Charlie Chan, or Robert De Niro, or Bruce Lee or some shit (
A gangster
)
He be jumping from behind trees on motherfuckers (
What you wanna do, kid, what you wanna do?
)
Or cowboys, bang-bang, or whatever, you know
Like my man, he tried to shoot a joker he had beef with (
I got the Uzi at the house, know what I'm sayin'?
)
He wound up shootin' my man up in the street, in the hospital (
Let me smoke this L, then tell me what you wanna do
)
Trying to be cowboys, they can't even shoot
Trying to be gangsters, but when the beast come on the motherfuckin' block, everybody break out (
Cowboy-ass niggas
)
They beat my man Bob G. up the other day
Cops, pigs just vampin' on him, yo (
Man, fuck the po-po,
 
it's good for his ass
)
Everybody standin' around just watching that shit take place (
Those niggas ain't doing right,
 
that nigga ain't smart
)
This always take place
Because they only gangsters when it come to being gangsters to theyself
They wanna be Corleone or Luigi (
Nigga, I am Corleone, what? What?
)
Or Gambino or Gotti or whatever the fuck that is (
I am Gambino
)
Some people don't even like you, you know what I'm sayin'?
They run around callin' theyself Rahim or Fuquan or Mustapha
No shit, 'cause we think they got power  (
What you wanna do then?
)
Fuck them, I got power (
What? What?
)
I got power, I got a family (
You ain't got no car, nigga
)
I got family business on Avon, on Chancellor, on Prince Street (
Y'all blowed up
)
Chadwick, on Stratford, Chancellor, uh, uh, Vailsburg
All of the Brick City, boy, that's my family (
I got family just around the corner
)
We gon' settle the score, once and for all (
Where your girl at?
)
I ain't gon' sit around and let jokers kill me softly, kid
I'm going out, I'm going out like a bang
And all of these zealots out here (
Man
)
Tryna steal and tryna bite and take what I got
Like all these big record companies (
Yeah
)
These, uh, corporations, these stores, they try to rob me?
Naw man, I'm goingâ€” I'ma get mine (
Man, fuck outta here
)
And my girl, we gon' go out together
She gon' be a soldier, kid
When I go out, she go out (
My girl gon' be a star
)
And we gon' make what we believe manifest (
Hopefully y'all don't go eye-to-eye
)
Fuck that, 'cause if you ain't ready now, you ain't never gon' be ready (
I'm always ready
