I'm learning how to live
Without you in my life
I'm learning how to live
Without you in my life
I'll take the best of what you had to give
I'll make the most of what you left me with
I'm learning how to live
They say the best is still yet to come
But the taste of you is still on my tongue
I can't forget and I won't even try
To erase your image
And the way you made me cry
I'm learning how to live
All I have left is this dime store ring
But I wouldn't trade it for anything
The days ahead will never be the same
For you I might have even changed my name
I'm learning how to live
I'm learning how to live
Without you in my lifeI'll take the best of what you had to give
I'll make the most of what you left me with
I'm learning how to live
