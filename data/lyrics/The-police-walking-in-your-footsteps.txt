[Verse 1]
Fifty million years ago
You walked upon the planet so
Lord of all that you could see
Just a little bit like me
[Chorus]
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
[Verse 2]
Hey, Mr. Dinosaur
You really couldn't ask for more
You were God's favorite creature
But you didn't have a future
[Chorus]
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
[Verse 3]
Hey, mighty brontosaurus
Don't you have a lesson for us?
You thought your rule would always last
There were no lessons in your past
You were built three stories high
They say you would not hurt a fly
If we explode the atom bomb
Would they say that we were dumb?
[Chorus]
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps[Bridge]
They say the meek
Shall inherit the earth
They say the meek
Shall inherit the earth
[Outro]
Walking in your footsteps, footsteps, footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps, footsteps, footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
