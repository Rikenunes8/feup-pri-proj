[Verse 1]
From the ice age to the dole age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered:
[Chorus]
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
[Verse 2]
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale:
"Oh I say"
[Chorus]
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
[Outro]
Send me the pillow (pillow)
The one that you dream on
Send me the pillow (pillow)
The one that you dream on
And I'll send you mine
