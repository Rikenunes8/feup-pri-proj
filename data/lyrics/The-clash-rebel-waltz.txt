I slept as I dreamed of a time long ago
I saw an army of rebels, dancin' on air
I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfire
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames
The rebels were waltzin' on air
I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz
That was written to be danced on the battlefield
I danced to the song of a voice of a girl
A voice that called "Stand 'til we fall
Stand 'til all the boys fall"
As we danced came the news that the war was not won
Five armies were comin', with carriage and gun
Through the heart of the camp
Swept the news from the front
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food
We knew the war could not be won
So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun
In a glade through the trees I saw my only one
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun
The soldiers were dyin', there was a tune to the sighin'
The song was an old rebel one
As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees
I slept as I dreamt, I saw the army rise
A voice began to call, "Stand 'til you fall"
The tune was an old rebel one
