I have a boyfriend
He says I'm his only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young (so young)
So young (so young)
Can't marry no one (can't marry no one)
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction
 (so young)
So young (so young)
Can't marry no one (no one)
No one (no one)
No one (no one)
I'm, I'm, I'm so young
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so young
I'm, I'm, I'm so young
Can't marry no one
No one
(So young)
Gotta go now
Cry myself to sleep
This lovin' baby
Will have seen the last of me (so young)
So young (so young)
Can't marry
No one (no one)
No one (no one)
No one (no one)
Oh (no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one)
No one
(So young)
