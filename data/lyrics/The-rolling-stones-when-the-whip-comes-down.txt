[Verse 1]
Yeah, Mama and Papa told me I was crazy to stay
I was gay in New York, which is a fag in L.A.
So I saved my money, and I took the plane
Wherever I go, they just treat me the same
[Chorus]
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I go to 53rd Street, and they spit in my face
But I'm learning the ropes, yeah, I'm learning a trade
The East River truckers are churning with trash
I've got so much money, but I spend it so fast
[Chorus]
When the whip comes down, yeah
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the shit hits the fan
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down
[Verse 3]
Yeah, some call me garbage when I'm sweeping up the street
But I never roll and I never cheat
And I'm filling a need, yeah, I'm plugging a hole
My Mama's so glad I ain't on the dole
[Chorus]
When the whip comes down, yeah
When the whip comes down
Yeah, when the shit hits the fan
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah, go ahead, sugar
[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, baby
[Chorus]
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah I'll be running this town
I'll tell you
When the shit hits the fan, baby
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down
Yeah
Oooh!
Shh!
[Outro]
Why baby, why, why baby?
I'll tell you
I'll be running this town
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Yeah, when the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
Yeah, when the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
