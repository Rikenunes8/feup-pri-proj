[Verse 1]
When a new life turns towards you
And the night becomes the day
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets this way
[Chorus]
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours, ooh oh
[Verse 2]
When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives
[Chorus]
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth, ooh
[Verse 3]
I am still here two days later
Same place, same time
And I'm stuck here two years too long
Same place, the wrong time
[Chorus]
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The sun, the sea and the hours
[Outro]
Their love died three years ago
Spoken words I cannot show
