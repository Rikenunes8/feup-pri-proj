[Verse 1]
Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows
[Verse 2]
Faithless love, where did I go wrong?
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong?
Faithless love will find you and the misery entwine you
Faithless love, where did I go wrong?
[Bridge]
Well, I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes
[Verse 3]
Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me, thrown its chilly arms around me
Faithless love like a river flows
