[Verse 1]
And I thought
I thought we had a love
That was true
A love we shared
Between me and you
We live to see each other every day
And we thought
We thought the same silly way
[Chorus]
But now I find
According to society
That our ages
They must keep us apart
But my darling
What will it be
Our ages or our hearts?
Or our hearts
[Verse 2]
And I thought
I thought we had a love that was for real
A love too strong
For gossip to kill
And darling
It's you I adore
It makes no difference
It makes no difference
Whether I'll be twenty-one, oh, and you thirty-four
[Chorus]
'Cause now I find
According to society
That our ages
They must keep us apart
But oh, my darling, oh, my darling, tell me
Oh, oh, oh, my darling
My darling, tell me, what's it gonna be?
Oh, oh, my darling, tell me, yeah
Is it our ages
Our ages or our hearts?[Outro]
I thought, I thought we had a love that was true
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling, tell me, what's it gonna be?
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Is it our ages or our hearts?
And I just wanna say that I thought...
