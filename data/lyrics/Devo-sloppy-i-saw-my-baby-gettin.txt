[Verse 1]
I saw my baby yesterday
Saw my baby yesterday
She spent her money on a car
Spent her money on a brand new car
It didn't get her very far
You know it didn't get her very far
So my baby said to me
You know my baby said to me
You know my baby
[Chorus]
She said sloppy
She said sloppy
She said sloppy
I think I missed the
Hole, la
Hole, la
Hole, laaaa
She said sloppy
She said sloppy
She said sloppy
I think I missed the
Hole, la
Hole, la
Hole, laaaa
[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
