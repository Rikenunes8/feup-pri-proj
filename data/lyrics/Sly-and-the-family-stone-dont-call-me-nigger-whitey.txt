Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Well, I went down across the country
And I heard two voices ring
They were talkin' funky to each other
And neither other could change a thing
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
Don't call me nigga, whitey
Don't call me whitey, nigga
