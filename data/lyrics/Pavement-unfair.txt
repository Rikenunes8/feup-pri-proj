[Verse 1]
Down in Santa Rosa and over the bay
Across the grapevine to LA
We've got desert, we've got trees
We've got the hills of Beverly
Let's burn the hills of Beverly!
[Chorus 1]
Walk with your credit card in the air
Swingin' nunchakus
 like you just don't care
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
And when I 
suck your kisses
, it's ours
[Verse 2]
Up to the top of the Shasta Gulch
To the bottom of the Tahoe Lake
Man-made deltas
 and 
concrete rivers
The south takes what the north delivers
You film hack, I don't use your fade
[Chorus 2]
Lost in the foothills on my bike
Drinking Euro, say goodnight
To the last psychedelic band
From 
Sacto, Northern Cal
From Sacto, Northern Cal
[Outro]
Take it neighbor, cause you're my neighbor
And I need favors, you're my neighbor
You've done me favors cause I'm your neighbor
I'm not your neighbor, you Bakersfield trash
