[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, making believe
[Verse 1]
Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
But I'll always dream, still, I'll never wrong you
And I'm making believe, it's all I can do
[Verse 2]
Because I can't hold you close (
Can't hold you close
) when you are not with me (
You're not with me
)
You're somebody's love (
Somebody's love
), you'll never be mine (
Never be mine
)
Making believe, I'll spend a lifetime
Just loving you and making believe (
Making believe
)
[Verse 3]
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours I find are so few
My plans of the future, oh, will never come true
I'll keep on making believe, what else can I do?
[Verse 4]
Can't hold you close, when you are not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Just loving you and making believe (
Just making believe
)
