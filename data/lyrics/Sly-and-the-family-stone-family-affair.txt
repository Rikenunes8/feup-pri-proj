[Chorus]
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
[Verse 1]
One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn
[Verse 2]
Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Blood's thicker than the mud
[Chorus]
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Over there, over there
[Verse 3]
Newlywed a year ago
But you're still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh-huh
[Verse 4]
You can't leave cause your heart is there
But, sure, you can't stay cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway cause you're all broke down
[Chorus]
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Oh, hey, a family affair
It's a family affair
