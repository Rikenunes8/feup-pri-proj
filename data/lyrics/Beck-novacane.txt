[Intro]
Funky, baby
[Verse 1]
Keep on truckin' like a novocaine hurricane
Blowing static on the paranoid short-wave
Short fuse, got to dismantle
Code red, what's your handle?
Mission incredible undercover convoy
Full-tilt chromosome cowboy
X-ray search and destroy
Smokestack blacktop novocaine boy
Got some rum, longhorn drums
Detonate with the suicide gate
Test tube, stillborn and dazed
Drugstore plains in the razor's haze
Got the momentum radioactive
Lowdown
[Verse 2]
Circumcised for the operation
Full spectrum generation
Cyanide ride down the turnpike
After hours on the miracle mic
Grinding the gears, eighteen wheels
Pigs and robots riding on their heels
Power through the roadblock, making a sandblast
Diesel aluminum cruising like Drano
Down the horizon, purple gasses
Semi-trucks hauling their asses
Novocaine, hit the road expressway
Explode
[Refrain]
Novocaine
Novocaine
Funky, baby
