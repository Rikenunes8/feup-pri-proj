Don't like to see your face
Don't like to hear you talk at all
I could be with Ann
But I'd just get bored
Can't even bring myself to call
And I don't want to see you now
Cause I know what you lack
And I can't go back to that
Whatever's all the same
Now there's nobody to know
And I can't recall-recall your name
All I can say is so
Your life is white
And I don't think I like
You hanging around
