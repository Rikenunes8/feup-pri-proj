[Intro]
Kick it
[Verse 1]
I don't need a shrink to tell me what to think
There ain't no missing link in my love life
It's alright, hah, I ain't that uptight
No, I don't need a psychic 'cause I don't really like it
When someone tries to tell me just what my future holds
I already know
[Pre-Chorus]
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side
[Chorus]
So I'm holdin' on, I'm feelin' strong
Baby, you're the one for all my life
Yeah, I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
Oh, I don't need to get all caught up on the net 'cause I'm already set
Can't you understand I already got my man?
No, I don't need proof to show me the truth
Not even Dr. Ruth Is gonna tell me how I feel
I know our love is real, real, real
[Pre-Chorus]
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side
[Chorus]
So I'm holdin' on, I'm feelin' strong
Baby, you're the one for all my life
Yeah, I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
Oh, save my life
Kiss me[Bridge]
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
Oh, I'm holdin' again
[Pre-Chorus]
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side
[Chorus]
So I'm holdin' on, I'm feelin' strong
Baby, you're the one for all my life
Yeah, I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life
I'm holdin' on to love (I'm holdin' on to love)
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
[Outro]
Save me, save me, save me
Save my life
