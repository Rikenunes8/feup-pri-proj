[Verse 1]
Hey, kid, I've got a ride for you
They say, "Your brain is a comic book tattoo
And you'll never be anything
What will you do with your life?"
Oh, that's all you hear from noon till night
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a trip on a rocket ship, baby
Where the sea is the sky
I know the guy who runs the place
And he's out of sight
[Chorus]
Flying Dutchman, are you out there?
Flying Dutchman, are you out there?
Flying Dutchman
[Verse 2]
Straight suits, they don't understand
She tried that one with the alligator boots
But the other side drew her in
Heart falling fast when she left
Even the milky way was dressed in black
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a trip on a rocket ship, baby
The sea is the sky
I know the guy who runs the place
And he's out of sight
[Chorus]
Flying Dutchman, are you out there?
Flying Dutchman, are you out there?
Flying Dutchman
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause they can't see what you're born to be
They can't see me
They can't be what they can't believe
They can't see what you see[Bridge]
They'll keep the boy spinning in their own little world
Tie him up so he won't say a word
They'll keep the boy spinning in their own little world
So afraid he'll be what they never were
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a trip on a rocket ship, baby
Where the sea is the sky
I know the guy who runs the place
And he's out of sight
[Chorus]
Flying Dutchman, are you out there?
Flying Dutchman, are you out there?
Flying Dutchman
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause they can't see
'Cause they can't see
'Cause they can't see
Are you still out there?
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
[Outro]
They can't see (They can't see but I fly now)
(They can't see, they can't see)
(You know, you know, you're jumping from a high jump)
Are you still out there? (I can see and I just lose myself)
(Don't hide your head, hide your head)
(So many know, you know, but them, they can't see)
