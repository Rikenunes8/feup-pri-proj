[Chorus]
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
[Verse 1]
Atomic tourist
A life in search of power
I found my test site
I made a ritual of emptiness
[Chorus]
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
[Verse 2]
We walk to walk off
The edge of my own life
Doom Town, a bright flash
My body is a souvenir
[Chorus]
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
[Bridge]
It took so long for me to see it
Hope’s a burden or it sets you free
Wandered through the void of you
Wandered through the void of me
I’ve grown afraid of everything that I love[Chorus]
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It's not the weather, it's the people we love!
