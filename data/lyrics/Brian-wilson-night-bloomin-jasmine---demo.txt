It's a quarter past midnight
On the street where you're roaming With
The scent of your cigarette
The scent of a love so cruel
And I'm twisting all
Through the night
But every time we touch
All that's left is Night blooming jasmine
And the songs that are leading me home
All that's left is night blooming jasmine
The scent of your cigarette
It's a quarter past midnight
On the street where I go
With a shape of your silhouette
Cuz' you never left my mind In that
Empty bar We were pacing all through
We were pacing all through the night
Still everytime we touch
All that's left is night blooming jasmine
The songs that are leading me home
All that's left is night blooming jasmine
The shape of your silhouette
