[Verse 1]
As I got on a city bus and found my vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver, "Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her, please let me off the bus"
[Choru1]
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey is that you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling, you got something else to do
[Verse 2]
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd trying to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
[Chorus]
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey where are you?
Seems like every time I catch you
But you're up to something new
[Verse 3]
Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
Flip the twenty dollar bill and told him catch that yellow cab
[Chorus]
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you
You're up to something new
[Verse 4]
She moved around like a wayward summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go on, catch her for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear[Chorus]
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey is that you?
Seems like every time I see you, darling
You're up to something new
