[Verse 1]
Though they say you're not my friend
You've been here through thick and thin
And for that little girl I love you
And all I want to do is talk about you
I'm here to say
I love you more each day
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so
[Verse 2]
Though they put me down because
I love you as much as I do
But they don't know what you've done for me
You've made such a happy man out of me
And I'm here to say
Love you every day, yeah
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, baby
[Chorus]
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Oh yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Mmm, yeah
[Verse 3]
Though they say that I am wrong
'Cause my love is strong
But there's only one that I place above you
It's God that I place above you
Girl, I just wanna say
Love you more each day, yeah
I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, oh yeah
[Verse 4]
Some folks say that it's strange
But my whole life you have changed
You've saved all the pain the world's put on me
All I want to do is talk about you
And I'm here to say
Love you every day, yeah yeah
Telling everybody that
I love you so, oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah[Chorus]
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Oh yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, yeah, I love, have mercy, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Every damn thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
Everything about you...
[Outro]
Ooh, mmm, sugar, all right, cookie, puddin', oh yeah
Mmm, candy, all right
And big old piece of cake
