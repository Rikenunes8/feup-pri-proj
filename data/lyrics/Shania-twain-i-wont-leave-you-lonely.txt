[Verse 1]
Together, midnight in summer
The air's so much warmer
Falling in love under starlight
Holding on so tight together
[Chorus]
I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be alright
I won't leave you lonely tonight
[Verse 2]
Imagine the air filled with Jasmine
The breeze blows with passion
You and me dance with desire
The moon is on fire
Imagine
[Chorus]
I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be alright
I won't leave you lonely tonight
[Bridge]
Je t'aime beaucoup, mon amour
You are the one I adore
[Chorus]
I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be alright
I won't leave you lonely tonight
[Outro]
Na-na-na
Te amo mucho mi amor
You are the one I adore
Te amo
