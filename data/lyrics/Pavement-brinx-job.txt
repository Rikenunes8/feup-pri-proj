It's so funny
We went right down to the store
We got the money
So they'll put you down
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
We got the money, we got money, we got the money now
It's so funny, we went right down to the store
We got the money so they'll put you down
It's so funny, we went right down to the store
And I won't even let you home
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
We got the money, we got money, we got the money
