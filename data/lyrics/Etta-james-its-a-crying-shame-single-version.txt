[Verse 1]
I'm a new born man, and I'm not your friend
Got a brand new jam, I hope you understand
I 'm, a new born man and this is were I stand
Don't wanna hold your hand
I'm gonna kiss you again and again and again
[Pre-Chorus]
It's easy, I'm gonna get you busy
It's easy, I'm gonna get you busy
It's easy, I'm gonna get you busy
It's easy, I'm gonna get you busy
[Chorus]
I wanna get you busy
I wanna get you busy
I wanna get you busy

Can you shine for a while, but this is not my style
Let's get busy tonight, baby you're so fine
