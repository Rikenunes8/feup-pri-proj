[Verse 1]
I am just an aging drummer boy
And in the wars I used to play
And I've called a tune
To many a torture session
Now they say I am a war criminal
And I'm fading away
Father, please hear my confession
[Verse 2]
I have legalized robbery
Called it belief
I have a-run with the money
I have hid like a thief
Re-written history
With my armies and my crooks
Invented memories
I did burn all the books
[Chorus]
And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The man's too big
The man's too strong
[Verse 3]
Well I've tried to be meek
I have tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman
And I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls
That have made me alone
Striven for peace
Which I never have known
[Chorus]
And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The man's too big
The man's too strong
[Verse 4]
Well, the sun rose on the courtyard
And they all did hear him say
"You always was a Judas
But I got you anyway
You may have got your silver
But I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds
And I gave them to your wife"[Chorus]
Oh, Father please help me
For I have done wrong
The man's too big
The man's too strong
