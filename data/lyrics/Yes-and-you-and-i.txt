[
I. Cord of Life (0:00 - 3:47)
]
[Verse 1]
A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
[Chorus]
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
A movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you
[Verse 2]
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed
Between the picture of time behind the face of need
[Chorus]
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you, oh
[Verse 3]
Coins and crosses never know their fruitless worth
Cords are broken, locked inside the mother earth
They won't hide, oh, they won't tell you
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by
[Refrain]
And you and I climb over the sea to the valley
And you and I reached out for reasons to call
[
II. Eclipse (3:47 - 6:16)
]
[
Instrumental (3:47 - 4:55)
]
[Chorus]
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you[
Instrumental (5:25 - 6:16)
]

III. The Preacher, the Teacher (6:16 - 9:26)
]
[Verse 4]
Sad preacher nailed upon the colored door of time
Insane teacher be there, reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
Political ends, as sad remains, will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 5]
I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you
[Chorus]
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
As a moment regained and regarded both the same
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you[
IV. Apocalypse (9:26 - 10:09)
]
[Refrain]
And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning
And you and I reach, over the sun for the river
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas
