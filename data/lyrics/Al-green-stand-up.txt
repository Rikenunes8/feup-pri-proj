[Intro]
Stand up
Everybody, stand up
Think it's time to stand up and identify yourself
Stand up and identify yourself
[Bridge]
What's your name, what's the nature
Of the game, who you are
How far you come, where have you been, hey, yeah
[Verse 1]
Stand up, you've been promised just one day
And that's today
Stand up, no sense sleeping your life away, ay
[Bridge]
Where you going, what's your plan
If you a loser or a winning man
Tell me now, I wanna know
You've got to let the glory show
[Verse 2]
Hey, stand up
Hey hey hey, everybody
Stand up, gotta stand up right now
Hey, stand up, tomorrow's about to come
Are you ready?
Stand up, today's got you on the run, hey
[Bridge]
Keep it steady, don't fall down on your face
And let someone take your place
'Cause you oughta know, you can do it
Tell me that there's nothing to it
Where you going, what do you know
Did you're friends tell you so
Can you make it by yourself
With the strength that you have left
Why don't you give me your hand
I'll try my best to understand
I don't know about goodbye
But nothing fails but a try[Outro]
Hey, stand up, everybody, hey hey hey
When you're lonely, why don't you stand up, everybody
Hey hey hey, oh baby
If you wanna help somebody, stand up today
Stand up today, stand up today
Oh oh, feel like you've only been promised today
You might as well stand up, everybody
