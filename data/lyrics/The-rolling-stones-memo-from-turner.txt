[Verse 1]
Didn't I see you down in San Antone
On a hot and dusty night?
Weren't you eating eggs in 
Sammy's
 there
When the black man drew the knife?
Didn't you drown a Jew in 
Rampton
When he washed his sleeveless shirt
With a Spanish-speaking gentlemen
The one that we all called Kurt
[Bridge]
Come now, gentleman
There must be some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming
Now you fixed your business straight
[Verse 2]
Weren't you in 
Hemlock Road
Back in 
nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggot little leather boy
With a smaller piece of stick
You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man
Your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organ's working perfectly
But there's a part
 
that's screwed on wrong
[Verse 3]
Oh, weren't you at the 
Coke convention
Back in 
nineteen sixty-five?
You're the misbred, grey executive
That I've seen heavily advertised
You're the [?] man
And the [?] clean
You're the man who squats behind
The man who works the
 
soft machine
[Bridge]
Come now, gentlemen
Your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus
When I'm laughing, laughing in my grave[Verse 4]
When the old men do the fighting
And the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mummy's meat
From tubes of
 
plasticon
So be wary please my gentle friends
Of all the skins you breed
They have a nasty habit
That is they 
bite the hands that bleed
[Verse 5]
So remember who you say you are
And 
keep your trousers clean
Boys will be boys and 
play with toys
So be strong with your beast
So Rosie dear, don't you think it's 
queer
So stop me if you please
The baby's dead, the lady said
"You schmucks all work for me!"
