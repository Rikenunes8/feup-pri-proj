[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
[Verse 2]
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
[Bridge]
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dicky
Is going to Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of hope
Money for dope
Money for rope
Oooh oh
[Slide Guitar Solo: George Harrison]
[Bridge]
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dicky
Is going to Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
Money for dope
Money for rope
[Verse 3]
I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth, now
[Verse 4]
I've had enough of watching scenes
With schizophrenic, egocentric, paranoiac, prima-donnas
All I want is the truth, now-now
Just give me some truth[Bridge]
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dicky
Is going to Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
Money for dope
Money for rope
[Verse 1]
Ah, I'm sick to death of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth now
[Verse 2]
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
[Outro]
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
All I want is the truth
