[Verse 1]
She wasn't a fool
That glittering girl
She followed the rules
That shimmering pearl
[Chorus 1]
Said the rules mama preaches
Go down when they break
The things mama teaches
You just gotta shake
[Verse 2]
But she wasn't a fool
That slender love figure
She followed her rules
And made money bigger
She wasn't a fool
That shining young woman
She followed her rules
She's crying for no man
[Chorus 2]
Said the rules mama teaches
Go down when they're broken
She explodes into peaches
And cries when I've spoken
[Verse 3]
She wasn't a fool
That goddess of Hell
There are no mother's rules
She makes them herself
[Bridge]
And I was down upon my knees
To beg her surrender up to me[Chorus 3]
Something inside her
Told her she shouldn't
Tried and allied her
But the girl wouldn't
[Verse 4]
She wasn't a fool
But love flowed from her face
She's not scared of me
She's afraid of disgrace
She wasn't a fool
That female for our world
She followed her rules
[Outro]
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
