This morning I woke up all in heat
Couldn't find no dry spot from my head down to my feet
Got gaspin' and coughin' 'til my body began to sweat
Couldn't find no comfort, torn with hell and fret
I start thinking about the sweet soul sexy body
And my body begin to feel
Couldn't forget the way you made my body shiver
And the cold sweat make me quiver
Girl, I need to talk to you
Girl, I need to be with you
Girl, I need to squeeze you
I need to squeeze you
Girl, I need you, OW!
So good (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Said I touch you with the power in my hand
Then I'll know you've been touched by a desperate man
Then I'll make you glad about the day and time that you were born
Then let you know can't sleep 'til your body moan
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Ha, I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
Make me feel good when you say the sweetest man alive
Ooh, feel me, count, 1 2 3 4 5
Ah, ha, hahaha
Ah-ha, ah-hahaha
Oh, oh (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Got gaspin' and coughin', and my body began to sweat
Couldn't find no comfort, dealing with hell and fret
Then I start thinking about your sweet so sexy body
And then my body began to build
Couldn't forget the way you made my body shiver
The cold sweat make me quiver
Really need to talk to you
Really need to be with you
Really need to squeeze you
Ah, I could please you, please you
OW! (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')

OH!Said I need to touch ya with the power in my hand
And let you know you've been touched by a desperate man
Then I'll make you glad about the time that you were born
Make you cough and sweat, make your body moan...
