I don't wanna lose this good thing
That I've got, if I do
I would surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause her love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightnin'
The way you love me is frightenin'
I better knock on wood, baby
I'm not superstitious about you
But I can't take no chance
Got me spinnin', baby, baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightnin'
The way you love me is frightenin'
I better knock on wood, baby


No secret, that woman fills my lovin' cup
'Cause she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her
You know it means so much

It's like thunder, lightnin'
The way you love me is frightenin'
I better knock on wood, baby
I better knock, knock, knock

Oh yeah, think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock
