[Verse 1]
When the waters is rough
The sailing is tough
I'll get drowned in your love
You've got a cutthroat crew, yeah
I'm going to sink under you, oh
I got the bell bottom blues
It's going to be the death of me
[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah it's the graveyard watch
Running right on the rocks
I've taken all of the knocks
Ain't giving me no quarter
I'd rather drink seawater, oh
I wish I never had brought you
It's going to be the death of me
[Chorus]
Soul survivor, soul survivor, yeah
Soul survivor, soul survivor
That's what you call me, a soul survivor
That's what I'm talkin' about, ah
That's what I'm talkin' about (Soul survivor)
Yeah, I'm a soul survivor
It's going to be the death of me
It's going to be the death of me[Verse 3]
Uh-huh yeah, when you're flying your flag
All my confidence sags
You got me packing my bags
I'll stowaway at sea, yeah
You make me mutiny
Where you are, I won't be
You're going to be the death of me
[Chorus - Outro]
Soul survivor, soul survivor
Soul survivor, soul survivor
It's gonna be the death of me
That right there, that's what I'm talkin' about
Oh, that's what I tell you, uh huh
That's what I'm talkin' about, yeah (Soul survivor)
(Soul survivor) Well alright
(Soul survivor) [?]
(Soul survivor) [?]
(Soul survivor) And I walk to the water
(Soul survivor) Get higher and higher
(Soul survivor) Oh, huh huh
