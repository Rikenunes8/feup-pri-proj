[Intro: Brian Wilson]
I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one
[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
We want to get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction
[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
So young
Can't marry no one
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
Can't marry no one, no one
[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Pretty soon now
I'll go to sea
Their mother's baby
Will have seen the last of me
[Chorus]
