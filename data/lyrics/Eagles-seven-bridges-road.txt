[Verse 1]
There are stars
In the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees
[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road
[Verse 2]
Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road
[Bridge]
There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide
You should go
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey
[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road
