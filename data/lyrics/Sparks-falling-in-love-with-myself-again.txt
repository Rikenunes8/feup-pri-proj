[Verse 1]
Similar mother, similar father
Similar dog, cat and fish
And we'll make the same wish
When the birthday candle's lit
We'll both be older
We won't get our wish
Yes I think that I'm falling in love with myself again
[Chorus]
Yes I think I'm falling in love with myself again
Yes I think I'm falling
Yes I think I'm falling
Yes I think I'm falling in love with myself again
[Verse 2]
With her hand in my hand and my hand in hers
Don't we look a blur
Me and her and me and her
Hey kiss her, oh kiss her
Our friends do concur
Yes I think that I'm falling in love with myself again
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I can't see with you in front of the mirror staring, staring
I can't hear myself think with all that music blaring, blaring
Yes I'm falling
Falling, falling
Falling, falling
Yes I'm falling
Yes I think I'm falling in love with myself again
[Verse 3]
I bring home the bacon and eat it myself
Here's to my health
Hope that I am feeling well
I'm burning the candle at both ends, oh well
Yes I think that I'm falling in love with myself again[Chorus] x2
