[Verse 1]
The look in your eyes, baby, just turns me on;
So inviting to me... You know I feel that they're my home
(Darling, reach out just for me)
And darling, I had to surrender with no sense of pride;
Your touch from behind on the shoulder's so tender
(The deepness of your eyes)
[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you baby
(The deepness of your eyes)
I feel your loving all the time
(The deepness of your eyes)
[Bridge]
The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, long day, yeah, yeah, hey
[Verse 2]
People say that the eyes tell stories, and they mirror the soul
Tell me, do we reflect the sameness of one, the unity to have and to hold?
(Darling, reach out just for me)
I tend our love in quiet seclusion, only you can say
If this is love or just an illusion
(The deepness of your eyes)
[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, baby
(The deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time
(The deepness of your eyes)
[Bridge]
The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, winding day, yeah
[Chorus] (4x)
I can't stop loving you, baby
(The deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time
(The deepness of your eyes)
