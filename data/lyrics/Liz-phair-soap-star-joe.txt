[Verse 1]
He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for something attractive to save
They say he rode in on the back of a pick-up
And he won't leave town till you remember his name
[Verse 2]
He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for some lonely billboard to grace
They say he sprung from the skull of Athena
Think about your own head and the headache he gave
[Verse 3]
He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for action at a price he can pay
They say he's famous, but no one can prove it
Make him an offer just to see what he'll say
[Hook]
Check out the dashboard lights
Glowing all green and white
He feels safe in the dark
He wears his bluejeans tight
[Verse 1]
He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for something attractive to save
They say he rode in on the back of a pick-up
And he won't leave town till you remember his name

Check out the thinning hair
Check out the aftershave
Check out America
