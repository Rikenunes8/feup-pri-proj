[Verse 1: 
Father
]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me
I am old, but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm
When you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not
[Verse 2: 
Son
]
How can I try to explain?
When I do, he turns away again
It's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know, I have to go

[Verse 3: 
Father
 & (Son)]
It's not time to make a change (Away, away, away)
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault 
(I know)
There's so much you have to go through (I have to make this decision)
Find a girl, settle down (Alone)
If you want you can marry
Look at me (No)
I am old, but I'm happy
[Verse 4: 
Son
 & (Father)]
All the times that I've cried 
(Stay, stay, stay)
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard
But it's harder to ignore it 
(Why must you go)
If they were right, I'd agree 
(And make this decision)
But it's them they know, not me 
(Alone)
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know, I have to go
