[Verse 1]
Six-lane highway running up to my back door
It won't take me where I wanna be
I took the I-95 down to Pensacola
All I found was a bunch of holy rollers
They don't know nothing about saving me
[Chorus]
I swear they're out there
I swear
I swear they're out there
I swear
I swear they're out there
I swear
Maybe angels, maybe angels
[Verse 2]
Down here I feel like a citizen of nowhere
My bag's all packed in case they ever come for me
Got a hundred stories and tabloid lies
Got witnesses to what the government denies
So I'm headed down to Roswell to wait and see
[Chorus]
I swear they're out there
I swear
I swear they're out there
I swear
I swear they're out there
I swear
Maybe angels, maybe angels
[Bridge]
Oh, what a mystery
Oh, I believe, I believe, I could leave
[Verse 3]
My sister, she says she knows Elvis
She knows Jesus, John Lennon, and Cobain personally
Well, but 
I'm too wise to believe my eyes
'Cause all I've seen just terrifies me
But I believe they're coming back for me[Chorus]
I swear they're out there
I swear
I swear they're out there
I swear (I swear)
I swear they're out there
I swear
Maybe angels, maybe angels
Maybe angels, maybe angels
