Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang
Suki suki
I'm coming in the Cherokee gasoline
There's steam on the window screen take it, take it
Wheels bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you trembling

Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

Oh back it, back it
Yeah pull up to the bumper game read the signal
Cover me, cause I'm changing lanes
I had a handle on it
My life, but I broke it
When I get to where I'm going
Gonna have you saying it

Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Going nought to bitch I'll see four million
Accelerating fast I can do this in a second
Lookin' in the rear view, swaggin' goin' swell
Leavin' boys behind ‘cause it’s illegal just to kill
Shift gear, automatic, damned if I do
Who's gonna stop me when I'm coming through?
What we got left is just me and you
But if I go to bed, baby, can I take you?

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio
