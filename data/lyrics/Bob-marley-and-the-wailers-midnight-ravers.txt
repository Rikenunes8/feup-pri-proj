[Verse 1]
Do-do-do. Do-do-do. Do-do-do
(You can't tell the woman from the man)
No, I say you can't, cause they're dressed in the same pollution
(dressed in the same pollution)
Their mind is confused with confusion
With their problems since they've no solution
They become the midnight ravers
[Pre-Chorus]
Someone say
(Please, don't let me down!)
Oh, please, don't let me - ee-ya-bab, oh, please don't let me down!
(Midnight) Midnight ravers! (ravers) Midnight ravers!
(Please don't) Oh, please, please
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
[Chorus]
I see ten thousand chariots (ah-ah-ah-ah)
And they coming without horses; (coming without horses)
The riders - they cover their face, (ah-ah-ah-ah)
So you couldn't make them out in smoky place
(make them out in smoky places)
In that musical stampede, where everyone is doing their thing
Musical stampede - people swinging
Musical stampede. Someone say
People, ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!
People, ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!
[Verse 2]
I can't tell my woman from the man
She is dressed in the same pollution; (dressed in the same pollution)
Her mind is confused with confusion
To my problem seems there's never - never no solution!
I've become a night-life raver
And I'm begging you, (please) please, please
Oh, beel-ya-ba-ba - please don't you let me down![Pre-Chorus]
(Night-life ravers) Night-life ravers! Night-life ravers!
Oh, please, please, please, please, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down!
[Chorus]
I see ten thousand chariots (ah-ah-ah-ah)
And they coming without horses; (coming without horses)
The riders they cover their face, (ah-ah-ah-ah)
So you couldn't make them out in smoky place -
In that musical stampede, oh!
It's the musical stampede. Ride on!
It's the musical stampede, some preacher say!
People ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!
A-ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!
Ride on, y'all! (keep a-riding!)
(keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!
Ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(keep a-riding!) Don't let me down, midnight ravers!
(keep a-riding!)
Midnight ravers, don't let me down! (keep a-riding!)
Don't let me down - don't let me down! (keep a-riding!)
Well, I'm coming!
I got too much talking
