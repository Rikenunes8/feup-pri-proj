[Chorus]
Grandma's maiden name was Zombelines
There's ninety years to tell about in a few short lines
Born in Newton County down in Arkansas
Then in nineteen-and-one, she married Grandpa
We laid her soul to rest one Sunday morning
And everybody knew she'd done her part
Don't get set to hear no hidden family legend
Just a song about the life of Grandma Harp
[Verse]
Just think about the times that she lived through
And think about the changing world she saw
Now somehow she reared a decent family out of poverty
And for seventy years, she loved the same old Grandpa
To me, her passing brought a closing chapter
To a way of life that I loved within my heart
I just mean to say, I think we owe her something special
If just a song about the life of Grandma Harp
[Chorus]
Grandma's maiden name was Zombelines
There's ninety years to tell about in a few short lines
Born in Newton County down in Arkansas
Then in nineteen-and-one, she married Grandpa
We laid her soul to rest one Sunday morning
And everybody knew she'd done her part
Don't get set to hear no hidden family legend
Just a song about the life of Grandma Harp
