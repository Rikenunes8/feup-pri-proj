[Chorus]
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates (Woo!)
[Verse 1]
Don't gimme the pretend, you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it, but that's how you made it
Just to keep it oblique
We're both high, high, high
High, high on lemon sips
We're all su-su-suâ€”
Sucked in by parlour tricks
[Verse 2]
Oh, the people deceive you, the kids never leave
'Cause you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still, you pick up the phone
But hey, man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no, it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old
And ah-ooh! We do what we're programmed to do
Hey, we do what we're told
Ah-woo-hoo![Verse 3]
I never remember to carry my book
When I get on the bus
You never forget, but it's your time to pay up
When they are making a fuss
We're both high-high-high
High-high on lemon sips
We're all high-high-high
High-high on wiggling hips
And ah-ooh! You break off your plans for the weekend
And ah-ooh! You can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go
Ah-woo-hoo! Go!
Ah-woo-hoo!
[Verse 4]
Don't gimme the pretend, you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all your plans 'cause we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high-high-high
High-high on lemon sips
We all claw, claw, claw, claw
Climb on to sinking ships
And ah-ooh! Avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah-ooh! Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
And then turn to stone[Chorus]
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You, you turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes, c'mon
[Bridge]
Hey, the rock writer told me to tell you:
"Though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star"
[Chorus]
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes
Ow!
