(When I say I'm in love
You best believe I'm in love
L-U-V!)
I always saw you, just before the dawn
When all the other kids, were just dragging along
I couldn't believe the way it seemed to be
Remembering the things, you used to say to me
(About...)
You know I can't be wasting time
Cause I gotta have my fun
-I gotta get some fun
I gotta to keep on moving
Can't stop till it's all done
And I'm never done
[Chorus]
Listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fits
Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
And there's one reason, I'm telling you this
I feels bad....
And I'm a looking for a kiss
Well, wontcha tell me why those kids are moving so slow
Is it that they just don't have a place to go
When the day starts breaking, the sun is gonna shine
It's hard to sleep, if I been crying(And...)
All the old ladies that are on their way to church
(You go to church)
Baby, here I be a' roaming, while a looking
Gotta get to a search, I keep on searching
[Chorus]
Listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fits
Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
If there's one reason, I'm telling you this
I feels bad....bad, bad
And I'm looking for a kiss
Well I been looking for a real.. hot.. kiss
Come on, kiss me
You think it's bad, but you know it's true
So why won't you just look here baby
When I'm looking for a kiss
When everyone goes to your house, they shoot up in your room
Most of them are beautiful, but so obsessed with gloom
I ain't gonna be here, when they all get home
They're always looking at me, they won't leave me alone
[Chorus]
I didn't come here, looking for no fix
(I-I-I know...)
I been hounding the streets all night late baby
Just a looking for a kiss..I need a fix and a kiss
I need a fix and a kiss
I need a fix and a kiss
...I'm a looking for a kiss
[Chorus]
I didn't come here, looking for no fix
(I-I-I know...)
I been hauling booty, all night long baby
Just a looking for a kiss
