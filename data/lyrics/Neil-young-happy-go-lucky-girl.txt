Cut up I put 60 cents in the can
Keep a promise to myself in the bays end
I love the boy I call Lucy
Thumb up in the air he thinks he can fool me
If I could Kill myself then I would
Curly hair in my stomach, the coroner could
He’s lonely not alone so I feel hurt
I give up easy cuz I’ve already learned
I’m holding onto the backpack that I pulled off
He’s got his bed and I’ve got him
Sitting in my lap with a big old grin
Green moss sitting in his chin
I pulled him out onto the track field so I can love him
I can’t wait until my paper tells me I can leave
I’ll walk a mile and blow my head off just to make a scеne
I’d do it just in spite so I can see him care
I can’t rеgret when I chose to throw out the spare
I’d kill myself if I could
Just so someone can thank me for hanging up in the woods
I’m holding onto the backpack that I pulled off
He’s got his bed and I’ve got him
Sitting in my lap with a big old grin
Green moss sitting in his chin
I pulled him out onto the track field so I can love him
Today I’ll leave that sick girl from my hometown
I’ll make sure that everything is packed up and Neil young is my friend
Dry up the wet cement you put in my eyes this won’t hold up when I go back in to the grass you put in
I pulled out every blade last year but it grew back and I can’t
So everyone forgets but I can’t seem to so I’m quiet about it
