[Verse 2]
Roll, roll, roll, roll, rollin' in Andromeda
Won, ton, ton, ton, rama in Andromeda
There's too many rings (This is the Space Age)
There's too many things (This is the Space Age)
Just ain't no atmosphere tonight
(Can't get no fuckin' tune tonight
Can't get no ship to go tonight)
If you're lucky you get to ride in a gold meteorite
[Verse 3]
If you're not, you get a mouth, a mouthful of red Kryptonite
You better move over, here comes a Super-nova

Destination moon

If you're in outer space, don't feel out of place

This is the space age
Others like you, others like you
