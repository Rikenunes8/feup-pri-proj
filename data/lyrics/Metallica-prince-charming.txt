[Verse 1]
There's a black cloud overhead, that's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree, again, it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street, you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry
[Verse 2]
There's a dirty needle in your child, haha, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead, still me
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth, I'm a dirty, dirty whore
[Chorus]
Yeah, look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, ma
Hey, ma! Look, it's me
[Verse 3]
Yeah, and he wants to be called "father" now, me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me, spell only me
I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play
[Chorus]
Yeah, look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, ma
Hey, ma! Look, it's me(It's me)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Look up to me
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, it's me, like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look, it's me, what no one wants to see
[Verse 4]
(Hey, hey, hey)
Now see the black cloud up ahead (that's me)
And this poison ivy chokes the tree (again it's me)
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street, you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry
[Chorus]
Yeah, look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see, hey, hey
Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, ma
Hey, ma! Look, it's me[Outro]
Yeah, it's me
Hey, ma
Hey, ma! Look, it's me
(See right through me)
(Look up to me)
(See right through me)
(Look up to me)
