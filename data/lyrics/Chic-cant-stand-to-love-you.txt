Every night I pray
Can't stand to love you
And every night and day
I can't stand to love you babe
Surprise baby, here I am
I'd like to have a few words with you
Just to talk about all of these things
That you put me through
Oh no daddy, she can stay
For once in our lives
We can get a straight story
Little punk, do it for me
Or I'll number your days
Every night I pray
Can't stand to love you
And every night and day
I can't stand to love you babe
I know that you are a sneak
You do these things behind my back
You could try to be discreet
I let you go
Now you think I'm a sap
The way that you treated me
You'd think I were into S&M
I can't deal with it
You won't get away with it
Every night I pray
Can't stand to love you
And every night and day
I can't stand to love you babe
