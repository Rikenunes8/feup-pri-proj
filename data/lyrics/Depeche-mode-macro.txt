[Verse 1]
Overflowing senses, heightened awareness
I hear my blood flow, I feel its caress
Whispering cosmos, talking right to me
Unlimited, endless, God breathing through me
[Chorus]
See the microcosm, in macro vision
Our bodies moving with pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution, one creation
[Verse 2]
Thundering rhythm, pounding within me
Driving me onwards, forcing me to see
Clear and enlightening, right there before me
Brilliantly shining intricate beauty
[Chorus]
See the microcosm, in macro vision
Our bodies moving with pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution, one creation
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
See the microcosm, in macro vision
Our bodies moving with pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution, one creation
