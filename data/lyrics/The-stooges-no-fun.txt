[Chorus]
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
[Verse 1]
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day
[Chorus]
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
[Verse 2]
No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else
[Bridge]
Well maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call Mom on the telephone
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
[Verse 3]
No fun to be alone
No fun to be alone
Now hang on, don't you let me go
No fun to be alone
I said to be alone
I said to be alone
No fun[Outro]
I say c'mon Ron
C'mon and lemme hear you tell em
Lemme hear you tell em
How I feel
I say c'mon lemme hear you
Tell 'em how I feel
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
