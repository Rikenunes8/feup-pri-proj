[Verse 1]
If you don't have a song to sing
You're okay
You know how to get along humming
Hmm, hmm
[Verse 2]
If you don't have a date
Celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn
And do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do and
Nobody does it anymore
[Chorus]
No I don't believe in the wasting of time
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
If you don't have a point to make
Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big-headed
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Better than fine
