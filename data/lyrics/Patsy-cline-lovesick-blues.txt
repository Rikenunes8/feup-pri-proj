[Verse 1]
Got a feeling because I'm blue, oh, Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
All I do is sit and cry, oh, lord
That last long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do you, he'll do me
He's got that kinda loving
But, Lord, I love to hear him
When he calls me sweet baby
What a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems
[Chorus]
I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
Because I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues
[Verse 2]
Now I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me
Well, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leaving
This is all I've got to say
I got a feeling cause I'm blue, oh Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
I lost my heart it seems
[Chorus][x2]
