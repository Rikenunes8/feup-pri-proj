[Verse 1]
Ooh, livin' as you do
And I'm watching you, oh oh
And you don't really know
Just-a what to do, oh oh
[Chorus]
You don't really know
You don't really know
You don't really know
What to do
[Verse 2]
Ooh, and I'm standing here
Not quite aware
And I'm trying, baby
Tryin' not to stare
[Chorus]
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watching you
[Outro]
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watching us
