[Verse 1]
No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up
I gave up
Lisa said, "Take time for me"
Dropping him down to his knees
Ah, chest down
[Chorus]
Take me away, see, I've got to explain
Things, they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place?
Oh, "you drink too much" makes me drink just the same
[Verse 2]
People tried, felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice
He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then, in dollars, makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over but I don't care
[Chorus]
'Cause I am with you, now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much" makes me drink just the same
[Bridge]
The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last
We all like it a little different
