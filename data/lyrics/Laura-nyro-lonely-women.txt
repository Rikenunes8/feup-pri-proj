[Verse 1]
No one hurries home to lonely women
No one hurries home to lonely women
A gal could die without her man
And no one knows it better than
Lonely women
[Verse 2]
No one knows the blues like lonely women do
No one knows the blues like lonely women, yeah
Blues, the blues that make the walls rush in
Walls that tell you where you've been
And you've been to the hollow
Lonely women yeah
[Bridge]
Let me die early morning
Whoa whoa whoa bitter tears
Whoa whoa whoa bitter tears
Uptight downpour
Don't got no children to be grandmother for, be grandmother for
She don't believe no more
She don't believe
[Outro]
No one hurries home to call you baby
Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
But no one, no one knows
