[Verse 1]
I'm depending on you
Everything that you do
And I'm depending on you
Yeah, to see me through
You know that I love you
And there is nothing I can do
But depend on you
Hey, woman, I wanna depend on you
[Verse 2]
I'm depending on you
This is our last chance
And I'm depending on you
To try to save our romance
Because you're the only girl
That I understand
When you tell me I'm your man
When you tell me I'm your man
[Bridge]
Promise me that you will never never leave me, oh now
Promise me that you will never never never say goodbye, oh
Promise me that you will never never break my heart now
And now you're making, making me cry
[Verse 3]
I'm depending on you
This is our last chance
I'm depending on you
Just to try to save our romance
Because you're the only girl
That I understand
Honey, tell me I'm your man
Go on and tell me, just tell me I'm your man
[Outro]
I'm depending on you
Darling, in every way you do
And I wanna just depend on you
Darling, in everything just to see me through
Darling, it's been so many hard times
Hard times when I need your all with no money...
