[Verse 1]
Told me, darling, that you had to go
Go fetch somebody, I don't care no more
I know you're happy, try to get along
[Chorus]
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
But time will take you on
Looka here
[Verse 2]
If everybody had once been hurt
Then you know how it mean to be treated like dirt
Go ahead, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman and my only girl
[Chorus]
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
I said, Money won't change you
But time will take you on
[Bridge]
I know you're happy
I know you're happy
And now you're gone[Chorus]
Money won't change you
Money won't change you, mama
Money won't change you
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you on
Looka here, looka here
Look here
[Verse 3]
I said, her smile has turned to stone
With a smile now that can't be sold
You said, baby, that you had to go
Go fetch somebody, I don't care no more
Tell your friends I was a fool
The troubled woman, you got to go to school
And a lover from way back home
I [?]
Dance in the street, in the car, too
Mashed Potatoes and I Boogaloo
Come on, baby, and let yourself go
Come on, baby, and let yourself go
Come on, baby, and let yourself go, ha ha
Fetch somebody, I don't care no more
Oh, yeah, hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold it, slow it down, hold on[Bridge]
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get on up, get on up
Get on up, get on up
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
[Outro]
Everybody stand up
Everybody stand up
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Let me tell you that I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long
