[Intro]
One, two, now
Yeah!
[Verse 1]
If elephants could fly. I'd be a little more optimistic
But I don't see that happening anytime soon
I don't mean to sound so pessimistic
But I don't think that cow really jumped over the moon
[Pre-Chorus]
When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?
[Chorus]
When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when
[Verse 2]
I'd love to wake up smiling, full of the joys of spring
And hear on CNN that Elvis lives again
And that John's back with the Beatles and they're going out on tour
I'll be the first in line for tickets
Gotta see that show for sure
[Pre-Chorus]
When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?
[Chorus]
When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when
Yeah[Pre-Chorus]
When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?
[Chorus]
When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when
Oh, that's when
