[Verse 1]
Effie, Madge, Mabel, Biddie
See them on the beach
Or in New York City
Tina, Louise, and Hazel and Mavis
[Chorus]
Can you name, name, name, name them today?
Can you name, name, name, name them today?
[Verse 2]
Wanda and Janet and Ronnie and Reba, oh, oh, oh, oh
These are the girls of the U.S.A
The principal girls of the U.S.A
[Chorus]
Can you name, name, name, name them today?
Can you name, name, name, name them today?
[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, oh, Kate, Kate, Cindy and Crystal and Candy
Mercedes and Joan, Betty and Brenda
Suzie and Anita and Phoebe and Jack, Jackie, oh, oh, oh, oh
These are the girls of the U.S.A
The principal girls of the U.S.A
[Chorus]
Can you name, name, name, name them today?
Can you name, name, name, name them today?
Can you name, name, name, name?
