Kisses from you in the flames of December's boudoir
They fill me like melons
Touch me with chivalry
Truly I know, truly I know who you are
December will bear our affair
Running on streets of delight and Decemberry ice
Oh see me - I'm ageless
Loving you timelessly
Love-colored soul, love-colored soul kissing spice
Yes, my love, I take my coffee in the morning
And all your love
A spoonful or so make us grow
Mama was clever, mama was clever
Said my mama was clever, mama was clever
Said my mama was, I said my mama was
I said my, my mama was clever
And my, and my daddy loved her forever
Forever!
Kisses from you I'll remember
Kisses from you in the flames of December
Kisses from you, true they are
Kisses from you in the flames of December's boudoir
Oh, mainstream marzipan sweet
Baking out in December heat
