[Chorus]
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
[Verse 1]
Don't know why we quarreled
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore
[Chorus]
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
[Verse 2]
Thought I didn't need his love
'Til he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
[Chorus]
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
