[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around
[Chorus]
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground
[Verse 2]
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw, but she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go
[Chorus]
And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
[Chorus]
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
Yes, I'm already standin'
On the ground
[Outro]
Whoo oh ooh
