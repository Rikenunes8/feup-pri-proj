[Verse 1]
You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are
[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death
[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy
[Bridge]
Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy[Outro]
Homeboy
Come on home, boy
Homeboy
Come on home, boy
