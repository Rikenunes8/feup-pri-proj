[Verse 1]
Baby's on fire
Better throw her in the water
Look at her laughing
Like a heifer to the slaughter
[Verse 2]
Baby's on fire
And all the laughing boys are bitching
Waiting for photos
Oh the plot is so bewitching
[Verse 3]
Rescuers row, row
Do your best to change the subject
Blow the wind blow, blow
Lend some assistance to the object
[Verse 4]
Photographers snip snap
Take your time, she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning
[Verse 5]
If you'll be my flotsam
I could be half the man I used to
They said, "You were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to"
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 6]
Juanita and Juan
Very clever with maracas
Makin' their fortunes
Selling second-hand tobaccos[Verse 7]
Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected
[Verse 8]
But baby's on fire
And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising
But any idiot would know that
