[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Where did your long hair go?
Where is the girl I used to know?
How could you lose that happy glow?
Oh, Caroline, no
[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Who took that look away?
I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true
[Bridge: Brian Wilson]
Oh, Caroline, you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline, why?
[Verse 3: Brian Wilson]
Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then?
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?
Oh, Caroline, no
