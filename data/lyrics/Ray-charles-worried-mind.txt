[Verse 1]
You promised me love that would never die
That promise you made was only a lie
Now after you've gone, all alone I'll pine
For all that I've got is a worried mind
[Piano Solo]
[Verse 2]
And when I was down, you just left me there
I needed you so, but you didn't care
You found a new love and a home so fine
But all that I've got is a worried mind
[Outro]
A worried mind
