Here in my home
Hold on, brother hold on
The road is long, we're on stony ground
But I'm strong, and you ain't heavy
Oh there's a misspoken truth that lies
Colors don't bind, oh no
What do they know? they speak falsely
Here in my home
I'll tell you what it's all about
There's just one hope here in my heart
One love undivided
That's what it's all about
Please won't you fall in one by one by one with me?
(fall in fall in )
Fall in with me
(hmm fall in)
