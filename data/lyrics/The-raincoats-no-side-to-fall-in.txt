I hear the music outside
And I am the music inside
No side to fall in
No fall to live until
My mind is still
My mind, my life
I don't mind today
I hear the music outside
And I am the music inside
No side to fall in
No fall to live until
My mind is still
My mind, my life
I don't mind today
