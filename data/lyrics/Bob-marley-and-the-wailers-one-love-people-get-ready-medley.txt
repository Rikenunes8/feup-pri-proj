[Hook]
One Love! One Heart!
Let's get together and feel alright
Hear the children crying (One Love!)
Hear the children crying (One Heart!)
Saying: give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Saying: let's get together and feel alright. Wo wo-wo wo-wo!
[Verse 1]
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One Love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask
 (One Heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?
[Hook]
One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about the- Let's get together and feel alright
As it was in the beginning
 (One Love!)
So shall it be in the end
 (One Heart!)
Alright!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
One more thing!
[Verse 2]
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armagiddyon
 (One Love!)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom
 (One Song!)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There is no hiding place from the Father of Creation
Singing!
[Hook]
One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about the- Let's all get together and feel alright
I'm pleadin' to mankind! (One Love!)
Oh, Lord! (One Heart) Wo-ooh
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
