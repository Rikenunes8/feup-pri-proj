[Verse 1]
Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair
'Cause you say that you found another man
Tuesday break heart (Tuesday break heart)
Guess you just don't care
'Cause you found you another man
[Chorus]
I wanna be with you when you're all alone
I wanna be with you when you feel you got
You got another man, baby see, oh baby alright
I wanna be with you when the nighttime comes
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes
I wanna stay, oh baby, lemme baby, baby with you
[Verse 2]
Tuesday heartbreak (Tuesday heartbreak) seem to be a drag
When you know that you love her especially
Catch up baby (Catch up baby), catch up with my dreams
Maybe then I can see you all the time
[Chorus]
But I wanna be with you 'til the nighttime comes
I wanna be with you 'til the daytime comes
I wanna stay and never go away, oh baby, it's alright
I wanna be with you 'til the nighttime comes
I wanna stay with you 'til the morning runs
I wanna, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh baby it's alright
[Outro]
I wanna be with you 'til the nighttime comes
I wanna be with you 'til the daytime comes
I wanna stay, oh baby, get away, it's alright
I wanna be with you 'til you say you've had enough
I wanna make your love
