[Intro: Black Thought]
C'mon, and yes y'all
You are now in tune to the sounds
Of the legendary foundation
[Pre-Hook: Black Thought]
Yeah, you go
Hey, you listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
[Hook: Black Thought]
Word up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, one, two, one-two, one-two
That's how we usually start, once again it's the Thought
The Dalai Lama of the mic, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listenin' range
Yo, the whole state of things in the world 'bout to change
Black rain fallin' from the sky looks strange
The ghetto is red hot, we steppin' on flames
Yo, it's inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist out The Fifth
This heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift
Like, a father lift up his seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sippin' chlorophyll outta ill silver goblets
I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object
There ain't no way to cut this tap, you gotta get wet
Your head is throbbin', and I ain't said shit yet
The Roots crew — The Next Movement, c'mon![Interlude: Black Thought]
And yes y'all
You are now in tune to the sounds
Of the legendary, foundation, check it out, uh
[Pre-Hook: Black Thought]
Testin', yo, it go
Hey, you listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
[Hook: Black Thought]
Word up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Word up, the formation of words to fit
That's what I usually disturb you with
A lot of rappers never heard of this, or know half the time it is
You doubt the Illa-Fifth, what could you accomplish?
Whether they skywritin' your name or you anonymous
You be speechless with stingin' sinuses
The Roots royal Highness is through your monitors
I tilt my crown, then blow down a dime a kiss
You need to buy a CD and stop rewindin' this
I'm the finalist, shinin' like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I'm the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this like an analyst
To see if you can handle this
Check it out—
You (You) got (Got) to groove
Emcees, freeze, stand still, nobody move
Unless you dealin' with the next movement
The P-Phi-D, we be the mon-u-ment
I live my life nice, but I'm not too bent
You theatrical as a Broadway play, this ain't 
Rent
One hundred percent straight out the basement
Spreadin' this across the planet on some next shit
Yo, how many people feelin' this love music? C'mon[Pre-Hook: Black Thought]
Yo, you go
Hey, you listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
[Hook: Black Thought]
Word up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music, the hot music
