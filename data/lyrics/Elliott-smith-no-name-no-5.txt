[Verse 1]
Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
A sweet, sweet smile that's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last
Don't get upset about it, no, not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last
[Verse 2]
And I hope you're not waiting
Waiting 'round for me
'Cause I'm not going anywhere, obviously
Got a broken heart and your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last
