[Intro: Kelis]
Yeah, I'm telling you, boy
You're wasting your time on them
The good stuff's right here
[Verse 1: Kelis]
I seen you when you walked in, stealing all the light
You're the type of guy that makes them fly girls fuss and fight
They can't love you more, not the way you're wishing for
They go about it all wrong, experts get it right
[Refrain: Kelis]
(Uh-huh) I'm telling you now, boy, put your eyes on me
(Uh-huh) And if you call now, boy, I'll throw my heart in free
(Uh-huh) I can love you in one million ways
(Uh-huh) And if you don't like it send it back in thirty days
[Verse 2: Kelis]
I know you're sick of them knowing who you are
All they wanna do is ride around in your fancy car
Gimme this, gimme that, and yeah, I know it's so whack
All they wanna do is be seen with a superstar
[Refrain: Kelis]
(Uh-huh) I'm telling you now, boy, put your eyes on me
(Uh-huh) And if you call now, boy, I'll throw my heart in free
(Uh-huh) I can love you in one million ways
(Uh-huh) And if you don't like it send it back in thirty days
[Chorus: Kelis]
This is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
This is the good stuff
[Verse 3: Terrar]
Bulletproof under the suit, no need for alarm
The way I flow through the club, call me Disco Don
But my name still Terrar, still the world at my palm
You chicken, 
heat front passenger seat load in my arm
Who she with next? One of two Clipse intended specs
Dance floor, hot sex, my hands rubbing her breast
What am I saying, baby? 
Discotech or discotheque?
Either way to miss my spray just swish your neck[Verse 4: Kelis]
Now that you've seen you really wanted me
And those girls wasted their time thinking they could possibly (Yeah, right)
You want this, you don't want that - Hear, girls, he don't want it back
And if you want the next one, you should repeat after me
[Chorus: Kelis]
This is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
This is the good stuff
[Bridge: Kelis]
(Uh-huh)
This is the good stuff
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
[Outro: Terrar]
Yo, you looking at stars
Yeah, you know who we are (You don't know)
Clipse, Kelis, Neptunes
Star Trak, I'll be back, baby[Outro: Kelis]
Good stuff
This is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
