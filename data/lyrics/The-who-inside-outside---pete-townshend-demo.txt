I'm leaving six-thirty
Rush my bags down
I'll have to stay dirty
And grab some hash browns
Get on the bus
Thirty guys are waiting
I'm the cause of the fuss
They hate all the waiting

They wanna go touring inside the USA
Inside, outside, USA
Touring inside the USA (Touring)
Inside, outside, USA
Will we make the plane?
We'll land in fifty-six
Just the same
It does the trick
The poke is fair
Up there in the air
All the vents are full
But the beer is cool

Touring inside the USA (Touring)
Touring inside thе USA
Touring inside the USA (Touring)
Touring inside thе USA

We think the States are really great
And there's a lot of touring time to pass
But we're having some trouble fighting down the yearning
For England's green, green grass
But here is a new town
With lots of friendly faces
It's hard to stay down
In these humdinger places
Demolition program
Play the best we can
Do all the numbers
Then explode the band
Touring inside the USA
Inside the USA
Inside the USA (Touring)
Touring inside the USA

The tour is nearly over
We've travelled so far
You've been a deluxe audience
So we'll bust a guitar
We'll scratch the drums
Microphones too
We'll throw all our money
And bust a hex for you

Touring inside the USA
Touring inside the USA
Touring inside the USA (Touring)
Inside, outside, USA

And we love it
