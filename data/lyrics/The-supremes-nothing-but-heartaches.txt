[Chorus]
Nothing but heartaches, ooh
Nothing but heartaches
He brings nothing but heartaches, ooh
I can't break away from his arms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his charms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his kiss (I can't break away)
'Cause his kiss I'll surely miss (I can't break away)
[Verse 1]
All my life I needed someone to need me
So I do my very best to please him
But the more and more I care
The more of him other girls share
When I need a hand to hold
That's the time he leaves me all alone
Just keeps me, keeps me crying
Myself to sleep (He brings nothing but heartaches)
[Chorus]
Nothing but heartaches, ooh
Nothing but heartaches (He brings nothing but heartaches)
But I can't break away
Oh, no, I keep on loving him more each day
Ooh, I can't break away from his arms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his charms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his kiss (I can't break away)
'Cause his kiss I'll surely miss (I can't break away)
[Verse 2]
To him I'm loyal, to him I'm true
Why can't he be the same way too?
But the more my love has grown
The less love he had shown
He makes promises he doesn't keep
Sometimes I don't see him all week
Just keeps me, keeps me crying
Myself to sleep (He brings nothing but heartaches)
[Chorus]
Nothing but heartaches, ooh
Nothing but heartaches (He brings nothing but heartaches)
But I can't break away
Oh, no, I keep on loving him more each day
Ooh, I can't break away from his arms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his charms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his kiss (I can't break away)
'Cause his kiss I'll surely miss (I can't break away)[Outro]
Nothing but heartaches, ooh
Nothing but heartaches (He brings nothing but heartaches)
I can't break away, oh no
I keep on loving him more each day
I can't break away from his arms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his charms (I can't break away)
I can't break away from his kiss (I can't break away)
'Cause his kiss I'll surely miss
