[Intro]
Emily
[Verse 1]
We're all alone on the stage tonight
We've been told we're not afraid of you
We know all our lines so well, uh-huh
We've said them so many times
Time and time again
Line and line again
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!
We think you're incredible
You say we're fantastic
But still we don't head the bill
[Chorus]
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!
Unbelievable!
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!
Unbelievable!
[Verse 2]
When the actor reaches his death
You know it's not for real, he just holds his breath
But he always dives too soon, too fast to save himself
He'll never make the screen, he'll never make the 'Sweeney'
Or be that movie queen
He's too busy hitting the vaseline
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!
We think you are really cool
We'd give you a part, my love
But you'd have to play the fool[Chorus]
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!
Unbelievable!
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!
Unbelievable!
[Outro]
We're all alone on the stage tonight
We're all alone
On the stage
Tonight
