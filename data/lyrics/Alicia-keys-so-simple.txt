[Intro: 
Lellow
]
It would be
It would be
It would be, so simple
[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
What it is ain't what it was
What should it be, when it comes to you and?
How it seems ain't how it is
There's been a change
When it comes to me and...
[Pre-Chorus 1: Alicia Keys]
Oh, baby, you, oh, baby, me
Oh, maybe we
Can try another day, another way
All in my mind
I'm wonderin' why
We cannot find
What was left at the beginning
If I could..
[Chorus: Alicia Keys and (Lellow)]
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple)
'Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
Could it be, could it be so simple)
[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Now it's hardly simple
It's just simply hard
When it comes to you and...
I find myself not being myself
Just to avoid
All this confrontation with..[Pre-Chorus 2: Alicia Keys]
Oh, baby, you, oh, baby, me
Oh, maybe we
Can put this armor down and settle down
Oh, it's off track
That is a fact
Can we get it back
Get it back to the beginning?
If I could
[Chorus-Alicia Keys and (Lellow)]
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple)
'Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
Could it be, could it be so simple)
[Bridge: Lellow]
Don't you know that it would be?
Don't you know that it would be?
Don't you know that it would be?
It would be
It would be
It, it would be
It would be[Chorus: Alicia Keys and (Lellow)]
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple)
Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
Could it be, it would be so simple)
[Spoken Outro: Lellow]
Yeah, we got the up rock
Do it like this, don't stop, mmm
Yeah, we got it goin' now
Now it's right on
