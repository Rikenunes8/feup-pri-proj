[Verse 1]
My fingertips and the lips do the work, yeah
My hips do the flicks as I walk, yeah
With a good head I came to make it
With a good head I came to break it
Did your mama tell you about me?
What did she say, "Don't go play there?"
Gonna make that hot boy want me
Gonna make that hot boy take me
[Chorus]
Excuse me, little hombre
Take my number, call me
I could get squeaky
So you could come and oil me
Excuse me, little hombre
Take my number, call me
I could get squeaky
So you could come and oil me
[Bridge]
Hoytu hoytu
Cept cept (Cet cet)
Cinko, quadro
Tres doie
You can call me over
Hoytu hoytu
Cept cept (Cet cet)
Cinko, quadro
Tres doie
You can call me over
[Verse 2]
Stick me, stab me, grind me or wind me
Fuck, we can even ask your wifey
Rich, bored at home with a kiddie
She don't know about you gettin' nookie
'Member when you first started me callin' me?
You had a ticket waitin' for me
Said you wanna meet in Miami
So we can start a family[Chorus]
Excuse me, little hombre
Take my number, call me
I could get squeaky
So you could come and oil me
Excuse me, little hombre
Take my number call, me
I could get squeaky
So you could come and oil me
