[Verse 1]
Well, she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand, now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man, now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now
[Chorus]
And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)
[Verse 2]
Well, the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks, looks and drives like an ace, now
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race, now
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
A lot of guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase, now
[Chorus]
And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)
[Verse 3]
Well, you knew all along
That your dad was getting wise to you, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
But you can come along with me
'Cause we've got a lot of things to do, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
[Chorus]
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)[Outro]
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
