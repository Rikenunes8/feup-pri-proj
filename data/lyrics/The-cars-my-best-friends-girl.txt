[Verse 1]
You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
[Pre-Chorus]
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, ooh
She'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way she dips
[Chorus]
Oh, she's my best friend's girl
Well, she's my best friend's girl, girl
But she used to be mine
[Verse 2]
You got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
Ooh, when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love, o-ove, o-ove
[Pre-Chorus]
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, yeah
I'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(Here she comes again)
I kinda like the way, I like the way she dips
[Chorus]
'Cause she's my best friend's girl
Well, she's my best friend's girl, girl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine[Breakdown]
[Verse 3]
Always da-dancing down the street
With your suede blue eye-eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
[Pre-Chorus]
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(Here she comes again)
Oh, she'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(Here she comes again)
I kinda like the way, I like the way she dips
[Chorus]
'Cause she's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl, -irl, uh-irl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine
[Outro]
(My best friend's girlfriend) Oh
(My best friend's girlfriend) She used to be mine
(My best friend's girlfriend) Yeah, yeah
(My best friend's girlfriend) Said she used to be mine
(My best friend's girlfriend) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(My best friend's girlfriend) She used to be mine
(My best friend's girlfriend)
(My best friend's girlfriend)
