[Verse 1]
Once embraced, can't ever be let go
Once revealed, can't ever be not shown
Once believed, can't ever lose faith
Once shared, can't ever be separate
Once sown, once can't ever be not reaped
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like the dawn of a brand new day
With the power of deity
Well, I can feel it inside of me
Feel it, can you feel it?
[Verse 2]
Once born, can't ever be not conceived
Once present, can't ever be past
Once first, once can't ever be not everlast
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Returning home of the prodigal
Holding the intangible
To believe in a miracle
Believe it, can you believe it?
[Chorus]
Have you ever been touched once?
Really touched
Could it ever be too much?
Can you tell me?
[Verse 3]
Once seen, can't ever lose sight
Once dawn, can't ever be not light
Once, once felt, once felt
Can't ever be untouched
[Pre-Chorus 3]
The assurance only hope can bring
With the conviction of the unseen
See it's greater than everything
See it, oh can you see it?[Chorus]
Have you ever been touched once?
Really, really touched
Could it ever be too much?
Can you tell me, have you ever really touched love once?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Have you ever been touched, once?
Really touched
Could it ever be too much?
I don't know, did you tell me?
[Chorus]
Have you ever really touched once?
Really, really touched?
Could it ever be too much?
Somebody tell me, have you ever really touched love once?
[Outro]
Ah, have you ever really touched
Love once?
Have you ever really touched love
Touched love?
Woooo-ooooo
Woooo-ooooo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Wooo-oooo
Wooo-oooo
Wooo-oooo-oooo
Oh, love once. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
