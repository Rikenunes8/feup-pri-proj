[Verse 1]
There's a sweet little girl that lives down the street
Some people think she's square but I think she's sweet
You can see her every day, strolling up and down the way
Looking so pretty and this is what I say
[Chorus]
She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her
[Verse 2]
Big blue eyes, long black hair
Dimpled cheeks and she's no square
[Chorus]
She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her
[Verse 3]
Ruby lips, shapely hips
When she walks down the street all the cats flip
[Chorus]
She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her
[Verse 4]
She loves to sing, hot rod queen
She's real gone in everything
[Chorus]
She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her, ah[Verse 4]
Loves to sing, hot rod queen
She's real gone in everything
[Chorus]
She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her, ah
[Verse 5]
When the music's hot, loves to bop
She'll dance till the jukebox pop
[Chorus]
She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her, yeah
[Outro]
Yeah, she's got it
Oh, oh, she's got it
Ooh, she's got it
Yeah, she's got it
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, ah
