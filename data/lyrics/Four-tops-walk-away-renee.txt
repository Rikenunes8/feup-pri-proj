[Verse 1]
And when I see the sign
That points one way
The lot we used to pass by
Every day
[Chorus 1]
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me
Follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
You're not to blame
[Verse 2]
From deep inside, the tears
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside, the pain
That I chose to hide
[Chorus 2]
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me
Follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down
Upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
[Chorus 3]
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down
Upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
[Verse 3]
Your name and mine inside
A heart on a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small[Chorus 4]
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me
Follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
[Outro]
You're not to blame
