I'm an orange moon
I'm an orange moon
Reflecting the light of the sun
Many nights he was alone
Many, many, many nights
His light was too bright so they turned away
And he stood alone
Every night and every day
Then he turned to me
He saw his reflection in me
And he smiled at me when he turned to me
Then he said to me
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
I'm an orange moon
I'm brighter than before
Brighter than ever before
I'm an orange moon and I shine so bright
Cause I reflect the light of my sun
I praise the day, he turned my way
And smiled at me
He gets to smile and I get to be orange
Da da da do dee
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
Shine so bright
He ruled the day, I ruled the night
Shine, shine, shine
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good he is, how God he isHow good it is, how good it is
How good he is, how God he is
How good it is, how good it is
How good he is, how God he is
How good it is, how good it is
I'm an orange moon
I'm brighter than before, brighter
Reflecting the light of the sun
Smile at me
