[Verse 1]
Love and hate was in the air like pollen from a flower
Somewhere in April time, they add another hour
I guess I better think up a way to spend my time
Just when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summertime
Should I go swimming or get a friend to hang around
It's back to summer, it's back to basics, hang around
Getting drunk out on the beach or playing in a band
And getting out of school meant getting out of hand
[Chorus]
Was this your celebrated summer?
Was that your celebrated summer?
Was this your celebrated summer?
[Verse 2]
Then the sun disintegrates between a wall of clouds
I summer where I winter at, no one is allowed there
Do you remember when the first snowfall fell?
When summer barely had a snowball's chance in hell?
[Chorus]
Was this your celebrated summer?
Was this your celebrated summer?
Was this your celebrated summer?
Summertime
Summertime
Summertime
Summertime[Outro]
Do you remember when the first snowfall fell?
Was that your celebrated summer?
