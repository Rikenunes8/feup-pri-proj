[Chorus: Black Thought]
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken szechuan
Sell a squads off like a slave auction
Ayo, my 
zodiac sign
 read "Caution"
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit 'em wit' a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door, son
M-illi-tilla
, Dice Raw, quick draw, son
You don't want no more, son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Erie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon enterin'
The Roots instrumentalin'
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit 'em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hole into a nigga pocket
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist
[Chorus: Black Thought]
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
[Verse 2: Malik B]
Zigga zigga zigga, tryin' to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup, I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, was caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked 'em wit' a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah, Malik B from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan whose name is Jalil
The moat is deep water, so let your hand expand it
Commandin', takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Kramden, we out, ya'll see in Hampton
Yo, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet, but still I plot
Once again[Chorus: Black Thought]
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
[Verse 3: Dice Raw]
Beans passed the MAC and we held 'em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly, baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once shit get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother, kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya gettin' carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You wanna battle? Change your name to The Forfeiters
'Cause that's what you do, face to face wit' raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters
[Chorus: Black Thought]
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]
They used to talk shit, but I'mma quiet them
Kick in the door wit' my boys, get to riotin'
First nigga that flinch, I'mma fire him
Tape him up, grip his hands, and plier them
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em?
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in
I used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him
Paid the front row seat watchin' Iverson
First class aircrafts what I'm flyin' in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm drivin' them
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' 'em
Ran up in y'all spot wit' Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit' Pie and them
But do my dirt, 21st, wit' Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and 'em
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and 'em
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them
Tore they body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em
Too sharp for them, move out in the dark on 'em
These Illadelph foul streets what I'm stompin' in
[Chorus: Black Thought]
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, ladies and gentlemen
Once again, 'gain, once again, 'gain
Once again, 'gain, 'gain, yo, Adrenaline
