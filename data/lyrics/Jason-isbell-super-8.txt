[Chorus]
Don’t wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Just because somebody’s evening didn’t go so well
If I ever get back to 
Bristol
I’m better off sleeping in the county jail
Don’t wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Having such a sweet night
Audience was just right
Drinking like a pirate do
Don’t wanna sleep yet
Buddy, it’s a good bet
I’ll raise more hell than you
Do a couple rails
And chase your own tail
And talk about the bad ole days
Tremor in a tee shirt
Telling me her heart hurt
Honey, let me count the ways
Then a big boy busted in
Screaming at his girlfriend
Waving ’round a 
fungo bat
Bass player stepping up
Brandishing a coffee cup
Took it in the baby fat
[Chorus]
I don’t wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Just because somebody’s evening didn’t go so well
If I ever get back to Bristol
I’m better off sleeping in the county jail
I don’t wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Well I finally got the room clear
Bleeding from my left ear
Feeling pretty bad for the maid
Lost a couple drinks
And my dinner in the sink
And I woke up with the bed still madeWasn’t quite morning
I wasn’t quite breathing
My heart way up in my throat
Girl starts screaming
And the maid starts screaming
And it looks like it’s all she wrote
Well, they slapped me back to life
And they telephoned my wife
And they filled me full of Pedialyte
Saw my guts, saw my glory
It would make a great story
If I ever could remember it right
[Chorus]
I don’t wanna die in a Super 8 motel
Just because somebody’s evening didn’t go so well
If I ever get back to Bristol
I’m better off sleeping in the county jail
I don’t wanna die in a Super 8 motel
