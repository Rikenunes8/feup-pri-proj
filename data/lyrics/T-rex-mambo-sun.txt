[Verse 1]
Beneath the bebop moon
I want to croon with you
Beneath the Mambo Sun
I got to be the one with you
[Verse 2]
My life's a shadowless horse
If I can't get across to you
In the alligator rain
My heart's all pain for you
[Verse 3]
Girl you're good
And I've got wild knees for you
On a mountain range
I'm Dr. Strange for you
[Verse 4]
Upon a savage lake
Make no mistake I love you
I got a powder-keg leg
And my wig's all pooed for you
[Verse 5]
With my heart in my hand
I'm a hungry man for you
I got stars in my beard
And I feel real weird for you[Verse 6]
Beneath the bebop moon
I'm howling like a loon for you
Beneath the mambo sun
I've got to be the one for you
