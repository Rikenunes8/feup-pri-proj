[Verse 1]
Thirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink 'til you can't even see anymore
[Hook]
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
[Verse 2]
My brother wants a ride to the liquor store
You pity him for what he wants it for
[Hook]
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
[Verse 3]
It's 1:30 and we're all getting nervous
The store closes at two
There's not enough to last us (Oh Shit!)
[Hook]
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more
[Outro]
See if you can find the key to your mother’s liquor cabinet
