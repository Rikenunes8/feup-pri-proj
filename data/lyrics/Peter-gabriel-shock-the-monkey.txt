[Verse 1]
Cover me when I run
Cover me through the fire
Something knocked me out the trees, now I'm on my knees
Cover me, darling please
[Chorus]
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey?
Hey, hey
[Verse 2]
Fox the fox, rat on the rat
You can ape the ape,
 
I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take anymore
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey
Hey, hey
[Chorus]
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey?
Hey, hey
Shock the monkey
Hey, hey, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Monkey
Wheels keep turning
A monkey
Something's burning
Monkey
Don't like it but I guess I'm learning
Shock, shock, shock
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
Shock, shock, shock
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey[Verse 3]
Cover me when I sleep
Cover me when I breathe
You throw your pearls before the swine
, 
make the monkey blind
Cover me, darling please
[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey?
Hey, hey
Shock the monkey
Hey, hey, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Monkey
Too much at stake
A monkey
Ground beneath me shake
Monkey
And the news is breaking
Shock, shock, shock
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
Shock, shock, shock
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey[Outro]
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey, hey, hey
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey (Shock the monkey)
Shock the monkey (Shock the monkey)
Shock the monkey (Shock the monkey)
Shock the monkey (Shock the monkey)
Shock the monkey (Shock the monkey)
Shock the monkey (Shock the monkey)
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey to life
