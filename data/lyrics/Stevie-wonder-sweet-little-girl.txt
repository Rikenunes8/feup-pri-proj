[Chorus]
Sweet little girl, you know your baby loves you
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Sweet little girl
Sweet little girl, you know your baby Steve is true
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Girl, I'm in love
[Verse 1]
Hey, my sweet, sweet mamma
You know you drive your baby mad
Oh my sweet, sweet mamma
You're driving me mad
[Interlude]
Come on baby, you know your baby loves you
I've given you cookies and candy, and the woofer
And you still don't want to be good
Come on now honey-sugar
You know your baby loves you, more than I love my clavinet
So baby, do me good, do me good baby
[Chorus]
Sweet little girl, you know your baby loves you
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Sweet little girl
Sweet little girl, you know your baby loves you
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Sweet little thing
[Verse 2]
Well, you got good loving
You know you make your baby mad
Oh, you got good loving
The best that I've ever had
[Interlude]
Come on now baby
You hear the phone ring
And sometimes you don't even answer
And you know I love you
And you just treat me all kind of ways
Come on now, honey-sugar
You know your baby waiting on your love doll
You know you got my load
Can't you hear me talking to you, honey?
I try to treat you good and give you everything you want
And sometimes I see you making love with your love doll
But I still love you more than I love my clavinet
Come on now honey-sugar
You know your baby love
You know just the other day I was
Gonna take you to go see a movie, Sweet Sweetback
'Cause I thought it might give you some inspiration
'Cause we ain't made love in so long
Come on now sweet little sugar
Honey baby
Now what if you knew I was going to put my harmonica down
Just to make love to you
Come on now honey, you know the woofer's waiting on you
Come on now baby, you know your baby loves you
Even more than he loves his clavinet
Don't make me get mad and act like a nigga
