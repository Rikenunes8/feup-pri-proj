Mama said before I'm grown
I'll find somebody I can call my own
So when the stars are shining bright
I dream about the boy who's gonna hold me tight
And I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Oh I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Will he be good to me?
Wonder, wonder who he'll be
Wonder if he'll love me
Forever
And ever
Every night I close my eyes
And there is something that I visualize
I hear a voice say "I love you"
I picture all the things that we're going to do
And I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Oh and I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Will he be good to me?
Wonder, wonder who he'll be
Wonder if he'll love me
Forever
And ever
I hope we'll never make each other cry
I pray we'll never ever say goodbye
Oh woah oh oh
Yes and I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Yes and I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Will he be good to me?
Oh wonder, wonder who he'll be
Wonder if he'll love me
Forever
And ever
Wonder, wonder who he'll be (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wonder, wonder who he'll be
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wonder
Who he'll be
Oh
