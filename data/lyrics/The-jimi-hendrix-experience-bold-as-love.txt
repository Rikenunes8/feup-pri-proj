[Verse 1]
Anger, he smiles towering
In shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown
Sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters
Taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies
Lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on
[Chorus]
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
[Verse 2]
My red is so confident he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine
Keeps holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
[Chorus]
But I'm uh, yeah, l'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah, well I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking, girl
I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis
He knows everything
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah[Instrumental Outro]
