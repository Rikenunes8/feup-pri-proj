Ten years ago, on a cool dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the 
man
 who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold was high and eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
