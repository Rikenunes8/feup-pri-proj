[Intro]
Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doo Dut
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah
[Verse ]
Why do fools fall in love
Why do birds sing so gay
Love is awake at the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip with a crazy beat
'Fore I know it will face defeat
Tell my why why
Why do they fall in love
Why do fools fall in love
Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doo Dut
Why do birds sing so gay
Love is awake at the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
[Outro]
Tell my why why
Why do they fall in love
Tell my why why
Why do they fall in love
