[Verse 1]
I met 
Ferdinand de Saussure
On a night like this
On love, he said, "I'm not so sure
I even know what it is
No understanding, no closure
It is a nemesis
You can't use a bulldozer
To study orchids
", he said, "So
[Chorus]
We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
And we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love"
[Verse 2]
I'm just a great composer
And not a violent man
But I lost my composure
And I shot Ferdinand
Crying, "
It's well and kosher
To say you don't understand
But this is for
 
Holland-Dozier-Holland"
His last words were:[Chorus]
"We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
And we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love"
His fading words were
[Chorus]
"We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
And we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love"
