[Verse 1]
And they'll lay you down, low and easy
And the lips that you kiss will say Christmas
And the miles that you traveled the distance
[Pre-Chorus]
So believe no lies
Dry your eyes and realize
That surprise
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
[Verse 2]
And the business will shake hands and talk in numbers
And the princess will wake up from her slumber
Then all the knights will step forth with their arm bands
And every stranger you meet in the street will make demands
[Pre-Chorus]
So believe no lies
Then dry your eyes and realize
That surprise
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
[Chorus]
And we'll send you glad tidings from New York
Open up your eyes so you may see
Ask you not to read between the lines
Hope that you will come right in on time, oh
[Verse 3]
And they'll talk to you while you're in trances
And you'll visualize not taking any chances
But meet them halfway with love, peace, and persuasion
And expect them to rise for the occasion
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't it gratify when you see it materialize
Right in front of your eyes by surprise
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
Mmm mmm[Chorus]
And we'll send you glad tidings from New York
Open up your eyes so you may see
Ask you not to read between the lines
Hope that you will come right in on time, woah
[Outro]
And they'll lay you down, low and easy
