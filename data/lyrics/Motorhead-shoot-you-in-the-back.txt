Western movie
The riders ride into the night
Into the west
To see whose gun's the best
They're all fools to live by rules
The rider wearing black
No, he's gonna shoot you in the back
Hey!
The horseman turns
The wound that burns
The awful pain, the crimson rain
He got to realize, before he dies
The rider wearing black
Know he's gonna, gonna
Shoot you in the back
Hey!
It's suicide to live on pride
You claim your own
Your skin, your bone
Your own life cuts you like a knife
The rider wearing black
He's gonna, he's gonna
Shoot you in the back
Hey!
