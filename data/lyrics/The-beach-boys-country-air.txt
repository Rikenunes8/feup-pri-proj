[Verse 1]
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Get a look at that clear blue sky
[Instrumental Bridge]
(Come on!)
[Verse 2]
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Mother Nature, she fills my eyes
[Verse 3]
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Rise up early, the day won't let you sleep
[Outro]
(Aah-huh, aah-huh)
(Aah-huh)
