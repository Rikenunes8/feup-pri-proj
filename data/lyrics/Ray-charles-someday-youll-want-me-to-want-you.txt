[Verse]
I know that someday you'll want me to want to you
When I'm in love with somebody else
Yes, you expect me to be true
Woah, and keep on loving you
Although I may be blue
You think I can't forget you
[Chorus]
Until someday, you'll want me to want to you
Yeah, when I am strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now, now, now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
Uh-huh, I know someday you'll want me to want to you
When I am strong for somebody new
And although you don't want me now, now, now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
[Outro]
Oh, oh
Although you don't want me now
Yeah, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
