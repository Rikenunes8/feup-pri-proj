[Verse 1]
Your flirts, it finds me out
Teases the crack in me
Smittens me with hope
[Chorus]
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
[Verse 2]
As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
I wouldn't mind perhaps
Spending little time with you
Sometimes, sometimes
[Chorus]
Possibly maybe
Probably love (Possibly maybe)
Possibly maybe
Probably love (Possibly)
[Verse 3]
Uncertainty excites me, baby
Who knows what's going to happen?
Lottery or car crash
Or you'll join a cult
[Chorus]
Probably maybe (Possibly maybe)
Possibly love
This is probably maybe (Possibly maybe)
Possibly love, possibly
[Verse 4]
Mon petit vulcan
Your eruptions and disasters
I keep calm
Admiring your lava
I keep calm
[Chorus]
Possibly maybe
Probably love (Possibly)
Possibly maybe
Probably love[Verse 5]
Electric shocks
I love them!
With you, dozen a day
But after a while I wonder
Where's that love you promised me? Where is it?
[Chorus]
Possibly maybe
Probably love (Possibly)
Possibly, possibly, possibly maybe
Probably love (Possibly)
[Verse 6]
How can you offer me love like that?
My heart's burned
How can you offer me love like that?
I'm exhausted, leave me alone
[Chorus]
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
[Verse 7]
Since we broke up
I'm using lipstick again
I suck my tongue
In remembrance of you[Chorus]
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
Possibly maybe
