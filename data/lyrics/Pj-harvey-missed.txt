[Verse 1]
He should not be hid
He's just too big
In a cloud, please come down
I'd put stars at your feet
Put Mars at your head
[Verse 2]
Show yourself to me
And I'd believe
I'd moan and I'd weep
Fall silent at your speak
I'd burst it full to the brim
[Verse 3]
Mary lost her head
And let it bleed
Came crying back to me
"My son, where's he been?
Don't deny it and don't you hide him"
[Chorus]
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
[Verse 4]
No words, no sign
Mary say, 
"I'm not lying"
How come he's so big?
But good lord, he's been hid
Good lord, where you hid?
Ha!
[Chorus]
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
