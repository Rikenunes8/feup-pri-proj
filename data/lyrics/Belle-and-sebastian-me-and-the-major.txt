[Verse 1]
Me and the Major could become close friends 'cause we
Get on the same train and he wants to talk to me
Me and the Major could become close friends 'cause we
Get on the same train and he wants to talk
But there is too much history, too much biography between us
[Verse 2]
Me and the Major don't see eye to eye on a
Number of things, he'll take a guy like me, oh yeah
Me and the Major don't see eye to eye on a
Number of things, he'll take a guy like me
And put him in the army 'cause the Queen's own army makes a man of you
[Chorus 1]
He doesn't understand and he doesn't try
He knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and I
We're the younger generation, we grew up fast
All the others did drugs
, they're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us
[Verse 3]
Me and the Major are from different worlds, but if
I get stuck in the lift, it's always with a 
toff
Me and the Major are from different worlds, but if
I get stuck in the lift, it's always with a man
Of noble standing who looks down on me like I was never born
[Verse 4]
I think the Major's going quite insane, he goes
Along the pavement and comes back again, oh yeah
I think the Major's going quite insane, he goes
Along the pavement and comes back again
Like he is on parade, he is on parade, at least he thinks so
[Chorus 2]
He is swapping his tent for a sheltered home
He doesn't have a family and he is living alone
He remembers all the punks and the hippies too
And he remembers Roxy Music in '72[Chorus 1]
He doesn't understand and he doesn't try
He knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and I
We're the younger generation, we grew up fast
All the others did drugs, they're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us
[Verse 5]
I want a dance, I want a drink of whisky so I
Forget the Major and go up the town, oh boy
I want a dance, I want a drink of whisky so I
Forget the Major and go up the town
Because the snow is falling
Yeah, the snow is falling
[Outro]
The snow is falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
