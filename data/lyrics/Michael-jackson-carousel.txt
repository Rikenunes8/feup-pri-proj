[Verse 1]
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
[Verse 2]
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories
[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away[Bridge]
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
[Outro]
I lost my heart 
(Lost my heart)
I lost 
(On the carousel)
I lost my girl 
(To a circus girl)
Who left my heart in pieces
(Lost my heart)
 Lost my heart
(On the carousel)
 Lost my girl 
(To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost 
(Lost my heart)
I lost my girl 
(On the carousel)
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost 
(To a circus girl)
I lost
I lost my heart 
(Lost my heart)
I lost 
(On the carousel)
I lost my girl 
(To a circus girl)
