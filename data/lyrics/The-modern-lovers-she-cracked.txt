Well she was sensitive
She understood me
She understood the European things of 1943
But she does all these things that I can't stand
I canâ€™t care if she stays with another man
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
Well she cracked, I won't
She did things that I don't
She'd self destroy, necessary to self enjoy
I self develop, necessary to self help
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
Well she cracked, I won't
She did things that I don't
She'd eat garbage, eat shit, get stoned
I stay alone, eat health food at home
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
Alright
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
One more time
One more time
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
