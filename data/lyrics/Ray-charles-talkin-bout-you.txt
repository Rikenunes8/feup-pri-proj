Who is my friend when all friends are gone
Nobody but you, I do mean you
Who is my friend when all friends are gone?
Nobody but you, oh now
Who is my friend when all friends are gone?
You always defend me if I'm right or wrong
Nobody but you, ah yeah
Nobody but you, child, I do mean you
Who is the salt in my bread?
Nobody but you, child, I do mean you
Who is the salt now in my bread?
Nobody but you, oh
Who is the salt now in my bread?
Who is my doctor on my sick bed?
Nobody but you, oh now
Nobody but you and I do mean you
Who knows how to love me in my way?
Nobody but you, child, and I do mean you
Who knows how to love me in my way?
Nobody but you, oh now
Who knows how to love me in my way?
Who's always there night and day?
Nobody but you, oh now
Nobody but you, talkin' 'bout you
All about you
