[Verse 1]
Here I am lovin' you
You're like a dream come true
For so long I've waited for this time
Girl. what you mean to me
In reality, you're all I ever hoped for
You will always be more than right for me
Each day I'll love you more
[Chorus]
Well, what it comes down to
(What it comes down to, what it comes down to)
This is all I want from you
(What it comes down to, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
[Verse 2]
Why do we stay together?
Talkin' about you and me
You got your reasons, I got mine
Oh, if it had to be, one and only me
Sure would be a drag now
Need somebody who, needs somebody to
Keep from bein' sad now[Chorus]
Well, what it comes down to
(What it comes down to, what it comes down to)
This is all I want from you
(What it comes down to, ooh, ooh)
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
What we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Hey
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
Ah, what it comes down to
(What it comes down to, what it comes down to)
This is all I want from you
(What it comes down to, ooh, ooh)
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
What we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
[Outro]
Well, what it comes down to
That's all I want, baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you (Oh, oh)
What it comes down to
That's all I want, baby, hey, hey, hey
What it comes down to
That's all I want, baby, oh oh
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want, baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
