I'm goin' down to the corner
Gonna have myself a drink
I'm goin' down to the corner, baby
Gonna have myself a drink
'Cause that shit that we been usin', baby
No, it sure confuse my thinking
I'm goin' out into the drugstore
Buy myself a goat
Tie him up in my front yard
For all my so-called friends to see
Ain't nobody gonna look in my window and laugh at me
Been up so long
That it looks like down to me
Please don't talk about me
When I'm gone
Baby
Are you against me too?
Had a great idea the other night
Oh, what if...
Come-A-Ti-Yi-Yippie, baby
Look out...
When the bloom of the night
Meets the gold of the day
We love you
We love you
We love you
We love you
