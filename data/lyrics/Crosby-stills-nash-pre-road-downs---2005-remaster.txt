I have kissed you so I'll miss you
On the road I'll be wantin' you
But I have you 'cause I love you
And you have me 'cause you love me too, yeah

Felt forsaken, you'll awaken
To the joys of livin' hand in glove
And then I will lend you my will
And your days will be filled with love
Don't run, the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches

Felt rejected as expected
You rejected all the thoughts of words
So I'll pray with you to stay with
Me forever and we'll make it work, whoa-oh-oh!

Elevated, you're elated
'Cause I've waited a year for you
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
Then I'm gonna make my love to you, whoa-oh-oh!

Don't run, the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches
