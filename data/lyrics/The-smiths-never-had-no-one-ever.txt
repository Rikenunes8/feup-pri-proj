[Verse 1]
When you walk without ease
On these
Streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
I never, I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I never, ever oh...
Had no one ever
[Verse 2]
Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude ...
Oh, alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I never, never ... oh ... had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one ever
Never... no...
Oh...
