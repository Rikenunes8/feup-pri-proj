[Verse 1]
It may be warm but the snow is going to fall
Enough to cover us all
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again
[Chorus]
We've got to have faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something big inside ourself
[Verse 2]
It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt
The snow we never felt
We're young and hardy again, we can bow to weaker men
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
The more we learn, the less we believe to be true
The more we prove, the more remains to be proved
[Verse 3]
{Guitar solo}
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again
[Chorus]
Inside ourself
[Outro]
Faith in something bigger [x8]
