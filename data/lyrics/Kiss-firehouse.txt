[Intro]
Whoo-hoo, yeah
Whoo-hoo, yeah
[Verse 1]
She'll adore you, and she'll floor you
With her wisdom and her vision
And you'll love it and think of it
Till you lose all intuition, come on
[Verse 2]
She can move you and improve you
With her love and her devotion
And she'll thrill you, and she'll chill you
But you're headed for commotion
[Verse 3]
And you'll need her, so you'll feed her
With your endless dedication
And the quicker you get sicker
She removes your medication
[Chorus]
Get the firehouse
'Cause she sets my soul afire
Get the firehouse
And the flames keep getting higher
[Bridge]
She's like bad weather, but it seems so good
You'd never leave her, but you know you should
[Guitar solo]
She's like bad weather, but it seems so good
You'd never leave her, but you know you should
[Chorus]
Ooh, get the firehouse
'Cause she sets my soul afire
Get the firehouse[Outro]
Whoo-hoo, yeah
Get the firehouse
Whoo-hoo, yeah
