Picture yourself when you're getting old
Sat by the fireside, a-pondering on
Picture book
Pictures of your mama
Taken by your papa
A long time ago
Picture book
Of people with each other
To prove they loved each other
A long time ago
Na, na, na, na na na
Na, na, na, na na na
Picture book
Picture book
A picture of you in your birthday suit
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon
Picture book
Your mama and your papa
And fat old Uncle Charlie
A-boozing with their friends
Picture book
A holiday in August
Outside a bed and breakfast
In sunny Southend
Picture book
When you were just a baby
Those days when you were happy
A long time ago
Na, na, na, na na na
Na, na, na, na na na

Pctures of your mama
Taken by your papa
A long time ago

Long time ago
Long time ago
Yeah, yeah, yeah
