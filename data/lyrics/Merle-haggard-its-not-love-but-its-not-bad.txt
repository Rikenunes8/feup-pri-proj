[Verse 1]
She was always there each time I needed you
Holding on to me like I held on to you
We still don't have what you and I once had
No, it's not love, but it's not bad
[Chorus]
No, it's not love, not like ours was
It's not love, but it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who she's had
No, it's not love, but it's not bad
[Verse 2]
I turn to her when you leave me alone
Sometimes even when you're here and you're still gone
She's slowly changing what you leave so sad
No, it's not love, but it's not bad
[Chorus]
No, it's not love, not like ours was
It's not love, but it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who she's had
No, it's not love, but it's not bad
[Chorus]
No, it's not love, not like ours was
It's not love, but it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who she's had
No, it's not love, but it's not bad
