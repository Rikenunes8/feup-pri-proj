[Verse 1]
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
I don't mind, yeah
[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
[Verse 2]
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you say it's wrong
You know I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true (Yes)
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
No, I don't mind, yeah
[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
But you know it's true
You know you only want me when I get over you
Oh, first you love me, then you get on down the line
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
No, I don't mind, yeah
[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
