[Verse]
How can I sit and 
eat my tea
?
With all that blood flowing from the television
At a quarter to 6?
I watch the news, eating, eating all my food
As I sit, watching the red spot in the egg which looks like
All the blood you don't see on the television
Still body now, no movement yet
Five men lie, die flat on their backs
Were they born to lie in state?
Defend the ever stagnate great?
[Chorus]
Down on the street, assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state, ooh
[Refrain 1]
Watch new blood on the 18-inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Ionic charge gives immortality
The corpse is a new personality
[Chorus]
Down on the street, assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state, ooh[Refrain 2]
Watch new blood on the 18-inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18-inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18-inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18-inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18-inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
[Bridge]
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
[Chorus]
Down on the street, assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state, ooh
