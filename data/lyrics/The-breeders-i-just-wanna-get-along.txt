[Verse 1]
We were rich once before your head exploded
Imagine doing just what the Big Bang did
The whole world knew it was loaded
Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't ever coming down now
[Hook]
I just wanna get along
I just wanna get along
I just wanna get along
[Verse 2]
I look up
The heads fly over
I see a boy I know; his hair's on fire
The whole world I discovered
If you're so special, why aren't you dead?
[Hook]
I just wanna get along
I just wanna get along
I just wanna get along
Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't never coming down now
[Hook]
I just wanna get along
I just wanna get along
I just wanna get along
