[Verse 1]
Morning seems strange, almost out of place
Searched hard for you and your special ways
[Chorus]
These days, these days
[Verse 2]
Spent all my time, learnt a killer's art
Took threats and abuse 'till I'd learned the part
Can you stay for these days?
[Chorus]
These days, these days
[Verse 3]
Used outward deception to get away
Broken heart romance to make it pay
[Chorus]
These days, these days
[Verse 4]
We'll drift through it all, it's the modern age
Take care of it all now these debts are paid
Can you stay for these days?
