The expedition had fifty recodes
Forty roses and neglect
Make your way, way way far away
Where you stay, where you play
Where do you play?
Can you say what you need when you really need it?
Are you gonna feel it?
Lady I know, know, know you don't
Need no license for your petty, petty, petty crime
If I should function two layer under
Around the circle luxury is so tough
So toughen up, toughen up
I'm not tough enough
Tonight we interact like separate worlds
Spoken barriers you hurl
Saw you curl
