[Verse 1]
I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case, time and again
I thought about it
You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was
[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
[Verse 2]
Your love is thick
And it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver
Than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service
[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
[Verse 3]
You are the bearer
Of unconditional things
You held your breath
And the door for me
Thanks for your patience
[Instrumental Bridge][Verse 4]
You're the best listener
That I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long?
I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now, oh
I am aware now
[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault[Outro]
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
