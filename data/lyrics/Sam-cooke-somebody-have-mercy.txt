[Verse 1]
Somebody have mercy
And tell me what is wrong with me
Somebody have mercy
And tell me what is wrong with me
Sometimes I don't know how I stand
The things this woman do to me
Let me tell you
[Verse 2]
When I think about how she do me
The tears fall down like rain, like rain
When I think about how she do me
The tears fall down like rain, like rain
When I think I've got her chained down
She starts acting up again
But oh, let me tell you
[Verse 3]
I'm going down to the bus station
With a suitcase in my hand, yes, I am
I'm going down to the bus station
With a suitcase in my hand, yes, I am
I'm gonna grab me an armful of Greyhound
And ride just as far as I can
And blow that thing for me now[Harmonica Solo]
Yeah, mmm
And yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, now
Mmmhmm, hmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yay, yeah
Let me tell you one more time
[Verse 3]
Somebody have mercy
I wonder what is wrong with me, Lord have mercy
Somebody have mercy
I wonder what is wrong with me, yeah
Sometimes I don't know how I stand
The things this woman do to me
Blow that one more time while I tell 'em
[Verse 4]
I'm standing here wondering, baby
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? Yes, I am
Standing, wondering, baby
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? Yes, I am
Oh I got a long way to get there
And I got a short time to go
[Outro]
One more time
Oh, oh, oh, hmm, hmm
