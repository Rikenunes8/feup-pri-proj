[Verse 1]
I loved you once but look at you now
You’re in someone else’s bed
I loved you once so I don’t know how
You’re with a man like that
You’d be better off dead
He don’t care, he don’t treat you right
It’s not fair, I still want you at night
Can’t you see you made a mistake, girl
He treats you like dirt and I hate it
[Chorus]
Na na na na na na, lady
Look at your hands
You got two fat children and a drunken man
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like it
Ma ma ma ma ma ma, baby
Look at your hands
You should have been my woman when you had the chance
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life now
[Verse 2]
He hits you once, he hits you twice
He don’t care about the blood on his hands
But that’s okay ‘cause it’s his wife
“It’s the only thing she understands,” he says
[Pre-Chorus]
Say you’re gonna leave him, say you’re gonna try
But you’re only talkin’ (only talkin’)
Oh, I know you think I’m a young boy
But I’m good and I think we can make it
[Chorus]
Na na na na na na, lady
Look at your hands
You got two fat children and a drunken man
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like it
Ma ma ma ma ma ma, baby
Look at your hands
You should have been my woman when you had the chance
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your life now
(Don’t like your guy now)[Bridge]
Well, excuse me baby but it’s makin’ me mad
The only one you want is the only one you’ll never have
Betcha don’t, betcha don’t, betcha don’t like your
It’s so sad
The only one you’ll never have
It’s too bad, only one you’ll never have
[Outro]
Na na na na na na, lady
Look at your hands
You’ve got two fat children and a drunken man
And I betcha don’t like your life now
