[Verse 1]
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run, tried to hide
[Chorus]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah
[Verse 2]
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
A-can you still recall time we cried?
[Chorus]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
[Organ Solo]
Hey!
Come on, yeah
[Bridge]
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get high
She get high
She get high
She get high, yeah
[Verse 3]
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chained us, eyes that lied
[Chorus]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, ow!
Aw yeah![Verse 4]
Made the scene, week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
Gate is straight, deep and wide
[Outro]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
