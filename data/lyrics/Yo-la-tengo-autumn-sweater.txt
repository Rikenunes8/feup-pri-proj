[Verse 1]
When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off?
[Chorus]
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater
[Verse 2]
I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently
[Chorus]
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater
[Verse 3]
So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always, but it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning
[Chorus]
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater
[Chorus]
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater[Outro]
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
