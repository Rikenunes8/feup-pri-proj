[Verse 1]
You're the one that makes my day a dream come true
Yet and still you wonder if I think of you
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not around
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound
[Chorus]
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care
[Verse 2]
There's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cause it's by your side girl that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way, no no
[Chorus]
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care
[Bridge]
I care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you, baby
[Verse 3]
No no, there's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cause it's by your side, girl, that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say, no no
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way
[Chorus]
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care[Outro]
I care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you, baby
You know I care for you
I care for you, baby, ooh
Care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
Care for you, baby
