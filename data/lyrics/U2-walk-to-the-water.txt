She said it wasn't cold
She left her coat unbuttoned
She wore canvas shoes
White canvas shoes
Around her neck
She wore a silver necklace
'It was given to me by my father' she said
'It was given to me'
She took the back way home
Past the lights at Summerhill
Turn left on to the north strand
And on
On towards the sea
He said he was an artist
But he really painted billboards
In large capital letters
In large capital letters
He was telling jokes
Nobody else would listen to him
I saw you that day
Your lips were cherry red
Your legs were crossed your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn
You were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind
Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me awhile
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
Walk with me in a light
A room in the Royal hotel
With sea facing views
A man with a suitcase
Full of things he doesn't need
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway
I'm on the outside
Let me inLet me love you
Let me love you
Let me
Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
Walk with me a while
