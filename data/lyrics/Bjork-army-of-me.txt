[Verse 1]
Stand up
You've got to manage
I won't sympathize
Anymore
[Chorus]
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
[Verse 2]
You're alright
There's nothing wrong
Self-sufficience, please!
And get to work
[Chorus]
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me, army of me
[Verse 3]
You're on your own now
We won't save you
Your rescue squad
Is too exhausted
[Chorus]
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
[Chorus]
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me, army of me
