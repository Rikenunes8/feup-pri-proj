[Verse 1]
This rock of ages
This rock of war
And the day you left forevermore
(Ha-ha, yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Stars, they're drilling stars
Our eyes afire for God
We do what we want 'til we want just one more life
We do what we want 'til we want to survive
[Chorus]
Say you hate me
Say you'd mark my grave
Swear religion has no spectral race
Chase me under
Right back where I sang
To brace new vision and decay in chains
(Ha-ha, yeah, yeah)
(Ha-ha, yeah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
All hail the blackest nights
The blackest night I'd find
All hail the blackest night
Blinding me with sight
[Verse 2]
This rock of ages
Lamplighters all
And the day you crept through the fog of home
[Pre-Chorus]
Stars, they're drilling stars
Our eyes, our eyes afire for God
We do what we want 'til we want just one more fight
We do what we want 'til we want to survive[Chorus]
Say you hate me
Say you'd mark my grave
Swear religion has no spectral race
Chase me under
Right back where I sang
To brace new vision and decay in chains
(Ha-ha, yeah, yeah)
(Ha-ha, yeah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
All hail the blackest nights
The blackest night I'd find
All hail the blackest night
Blinding me with sight
[Outro]
I'll rock your mind
I'll rock your mind
From Milky Way to Mersey Quay
To mystic climes
Leave it all behind
Rock island lines
I'll rock your mind
