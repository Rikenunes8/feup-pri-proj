[Verse 1]
Gotta story for you
'Bout a little friend
Never felt good enough
Had a heart to mend
Never felt pretty
Learned to just pretend
Wished someone had listened
For her silent cries of pain
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild
[Verse 2]
Didn't want to burden
Mother had enough stress
So often I'd talk to you
Through my four-legged friends
Always there to listen
Though I felt so all alone
And in my times of trouble
I know you saw my smiles of pain
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild
[Verse 3]
Now that I am older
Gone through so much pain
I learned that I should love me
No more feeling ashamed
I've seen the great illusions
I've sought the rough terrain
I'm walking my own journey
And my love for you remains[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild
Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild
[Outro]
I know I'm the lucky one
I know I'm a special one
I know, that God does
Not have a stepchild
