When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right
I mistreated my baby, and I can't see no reason why
I mistreated my baby, but I can't see no reason why
Every time I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry
Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me
Mmm mmm mmm, would she sympathize with me
She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be
Mmm mmm, babe, I may be right ay wrong
Baby it's yo'why opinion, oh, I may be right ay wrong
Watch your close friend, baby, then your enemies can't do no harm
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right
