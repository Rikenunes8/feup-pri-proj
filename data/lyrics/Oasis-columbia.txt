[Intro]
I’ve seen so much to disgust mother, take me into your arms… how am I to protect you?
[Verse 1]
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
[Chorus]
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
[Verse 2]
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear
[Chorus]
So I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
[Post-Chorus]
This is confusion, am I confusing you?
This is confusion, am I amusing you?
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya'
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya'
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
