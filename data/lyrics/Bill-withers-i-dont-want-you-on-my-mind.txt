[Verse 1]
I don't want you on my mind all the time
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness
[Pre-Chorus]
If I dream about you
I just wake up knowing that I've got to do without you
[Chorus]
I don't want you all the time doin' up my mind
I don't want you on my mind all the time
[Verse 2]
I don't want you on my mind all the time
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness
[Pre-Chorus]
If I dream about you
I just wake up knowing that I got to do without you
[Chorus]
I don't want you all the time doin' up my mind
I don't want you on my mind all the time
