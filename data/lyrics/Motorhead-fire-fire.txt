[Verse 1]
Foxy, do you have a light?
Can you light me up tonight?
I'd like to see you burn me down
Why don't you let me light your fire?
Why don't you let me stoke you higher?
[Chorus 1]
Fire, Fire! Holocaust
Fire, Fire! Given up for lost
Fire, Fire! Strike one, strike two
Fire, Fire! I'm a match for you
[Verse 2]
You're quick to learn
I love to watch you burn
Come any time I'll torch you out
Only you can create the flame
Only you can scorch my brain
[Chorus 2]
Fire, Fire! Conflagration
Fire, Fire! Hellfire, damnation
Fire, Fire! Strike six, strike eight
Fire, Fire! I think you're great
[Verse 3]
You can put me out
But there ain't no doubt
You ain't nowhere near safe with me
You ain't the first to turn me down
You ain't the first to turn me 'round
[Chorus 3]
Fire, Fire! Big black smoke
Fire, Fire! Ain't no joke
Fire, Fire! Strike nine, and then
Fire, Fire! Strike out again
