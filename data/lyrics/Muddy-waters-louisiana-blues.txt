[Verse]
I'm going down in Louisiana
Be, be, behind the sun
I'm going down in Louisiana
Honey, behind the sun
Well, you know I just found out
My troubles just begun
I'm going down in New Orleans, hmm
Get me a mojo hand
I'm going down in New Orleans
Get me a mojo hand
Oh take me with you, man, when you going
I'm on show all you good looking women
Yes, how to treat your love
Let's go back to New Orleans
