[Verse 1]
Oh, ooh, baby
There's something that I gotta tell ya
Baby, you should know
What's on my mind
Now, ooh, baby
I'm feelin' our situation
It's gettin' stronger
How we wanted
But I gotta take my time
[Pre-Chorus]
See, there's so much about you that I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it
But before we go too far across the line
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure, mmm
[Chorus]
Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe
Baby, slow down
(I think it's really too soon)
[Verse 2]
Ooh, baby
It's like I've known you forever
My medulla oblongata will electrify
Ooh, ooh, baby
Whenever we're alone together
I'm 'bout to explode and it feels so right
But I gotta take my time[Pre-Chorus]
See, there so much about you that I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it (Nah)
But before we get too far across the line
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure, oh
[Chorus]
Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe
Baby, slow down
(Baby, it's really too soon)
Soon, yeah
[Bridge]
See, I know what is best 'cause I've been here before
Gave myself to someone for all the wrong reasons (Reasons)
But this time around, I don't wanna do that again
I just wanna make this the way that I've dreamed of
So, baby, you got to...
[Chorus]
Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe
Baby, slow down
(I think it's really too soon)
Yeah, slow down
You gotta slow down, you gotta slow down
You gotta slow down, you gotta slow down
