[Verse 1]
Lyin' in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after—
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, oh, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time
[Verse 3]
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
[Refrain]
You say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, oh, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time
[Outro]
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after—
Time—
