Well, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on"
God said, "No"
Abe said, "What?"
God said, "You do what you want to, Abe but
The next time you see me coming, you'd better run"
Abe said, "Where do you want this killing done?"
God said, "Out on that Highway 61"

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department would give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"
Sam said, "Quick man, tell me, I got to run"
Howard just pointed with his gun
He said, "that way down on 61"

Well, Mack the finger said, "Louie the King
I've got 40 red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that won't ring
You know where I can get rid of these things?"
And he said, "Now let me think for a minute, son"
Said ,"Yes, that can be easily done
Just take them down on that 61"

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white"
He said, "Come here and stare up into the light"
And said, "Mmm, you're right
Let me tell the second mother it's been done"
But the second mother with the seventh son
They were out on that Highway 61[Verse 5]
Now, the roving gambler was very bored
Trying to create the next world war
And he found a promoter, fell on the floor
And said, "I've never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yep, I think it can be easily done"

"We'll just put some bleachers there out in the sun
And have it out on that 61"
