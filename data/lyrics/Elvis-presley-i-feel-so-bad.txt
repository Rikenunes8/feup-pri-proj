[Verse 1]
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes, I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away
[Verse 2]
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I won't
Then again I think I will
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Sometimes I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away
[Outro]
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I won't
Then again I think I will
