[Verse 1]
I'm against the days
When the skies stay bummer-grey
And the cake just tastes okay, okay
Well, I guess I'm anti-yuck
Against the stuff that sucks
The life out of your soul
And shuts it down
[Verse 2]
I'm against the thought
Letting good tomatoes rot
Being someone that you're not, when you're not
Well I guess I'm anti-hate
'Cause that ain't what it takes
It's love that makes this crazy world go round
[Chorus]
I'm for the sun, I'm for the breeze
Old dogs sleeping at your feet
I'm for the girls with the curls and the curves
I'm for questions
I'm for freedom
Celebrating every season
For the bees and the trees and the dirt
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
[Verse 3]
I'm against the notion
Of drinking witchy potions
And causing big commotion
You know, son
I guess I'm anti-confrontation
I'd rather have a conversation
About nothing in particular at all
[Verse 4]
I'm against them feelings
The ones that get revealing
Slamming hearts right in the ceilings
You feel me
And I guess I'm anti-tears
I'd rather sip an ice cold beer
Listen to some country music until dawn[Chorus]
'Cause I'm for the sun, I'm for the breeze
Old dogs sleeping at your feet
I'm for the girls with the curls and the curves
I'm for questions
I'm for freedom
Celebrating every season
For the trees and the bees and the dirt
I'm for feathers
I'm for wings
I'm for tweedle-deedle-dee-dee-dee
For what it's worth
For what it's worth
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
I'm for the birds (I'm for the birds)
Tweedle-deedle-dee-dee-dee
