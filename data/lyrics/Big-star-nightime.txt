At nighttime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool, and hurrying on my way
Dressing so sweet, all the people to see
They're looking at me, all the people to see
And when I set my eyes on you, you look like a 
kitty
And when you're in the moon, oh, you look so pretty
Caught a glance in your eyes, and fell through the skies
Glance in your eyes, and fell through the skies
And walking down the freezing street, scarf goes out behind
You said, get them away, please don't say a word
Get me out of here, get me out of here
I hate it here, get me out of here
At nighttime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool, and hurrying on my way
Glance in your eyes, and fell through the skies
Glance in your eyes, and fell through the skies
