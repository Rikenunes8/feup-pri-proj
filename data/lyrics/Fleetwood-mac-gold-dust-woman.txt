[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out
[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your 
shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale
[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
[Chorus: Variation]
Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home
[Outro]
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman
