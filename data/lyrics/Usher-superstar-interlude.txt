[Verse]
This goes out to you, you
My number one (Number one, number one)
I won't stop until I see you, sugar
You know who you are
This is for my number one (I see you), number one
So many shows
Swear wherever I go, I'm gonna keep on lookin', yeah
Lookin' for my number one, number one
Oh, this goes out to you, baby
Wherever you are (My only one)
Just know that you're mine (Number one, number one), yeah
[Break]
Are you there? I can't hear you
On the road, doin' shows
Girl, I can't get you off my mind
All around the world
So many faces, all these places
And I just need one
My number one
This is for you (Looking for my number one)
You, my number one
[Outro: crowd chanting]
Usher! Usher! Usher! Usher! Usher!
