How fucking romantic
All the stars are out
Twinkling twinkling twinkling
And fluttering about
What a tacky sunset
What a vulgar moon
Play another charming
Rodgers & Hart tune
How fucking romantic
Must we really waltz
Drag another cliché
Howling from the vaults
Love you, obviously
Like you really care
Even though you treat me
Like a dancing bear
Toss your bear a goldfish
As it cycles by
Don't forget to feed your
Bear or it'll die
