[Verse 1]
I see a river
It's oceans that I want
You have to give me everything
Everything's not enough
[Pre-Chorus]
It's my desire
To give myself to you, sometimes
[Chorus]
Sometimes I try
Sometimes I lie, with you
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I die, it's true
Somewhere I find
Something that's kind
[Verse 2]
And I've crossed the line again
A line I drew in sand
Still, you give me everything
And everything's not enough
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready, but not willing
To give myself to you, sometimes
[Chorus]
Sometimes I try
Sometimes I lie, with you
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I die, it's true
Somewhere I find
Something that's kind
[Bridge]
Come on over, lay down beside me
And I'll try
Come on over, lay down beside me
And I'll try, and I'll try
[Outro]
I want it all
