[Verse 1]
Josephina, there's so much I want to know
I've known you for all of mine but not all of yours
You're not a stranger, no, nothing could be further
I look back and I wonder what you were like long before
[Verse 2]
Josephina, if I asked you, would you tell me?
The fact from the fancy and the dreams in between
Tell me a story all about yours truly
Photographs from the past, imagine the mystery
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you get your head lost in a daydream?
Cinderella waiting for her charming
Did you break a heart like little girls often do?
Pigtails and painted toes
All dressed up in your mother's clothes
[Chorus]
Can you shine the light?
Can you shine the light?
Oh please, can you shine some light?
Yeah, can you shine the light?
Shine the light on a shadow
[Verse 3]
Josephina, would you lay down your defenses?
So I can make sense of those colors fading to grey
Not that you're hiding, something I'd never imply
Yesteryear may be gone, can't say the same for today
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
Yeah, Josephina
Ah, Josephina[Pre-Chorus 2]
How else am I to know that all the while
There was a mischievous look behind that smile?
It's hard to tell when innocence comes and goes
I'm sure that there were times life could be unkind
Without a shoulder to cry on
[Chorus]
Can you shine the light?
Can you shine the light?
Yeah please, can you shine some light?
Yeah, can you shine the light?
Yeah, can you shine the light?
Shine the light on a shadow
