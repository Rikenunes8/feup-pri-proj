[Verse 1]
You are just a concept
You are just a dream
You're just a reflection
Of the new regime
[Verse 2]
You are just a symbol
You are just a theme
You're just another figure
For the sales machine
[Chorus]
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
With yoo ooo
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
With yoo ooo
Ooo ooo cos they're watching
Yoo ooo
[Verse 3]
You are just a victim
You are just a find
Soon to be a casuality
A casuality of time
[Verse 1]
You are just a concept
You are just a dream
You're just a reflection
Of the new regime
[Chorus]
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
With yoo ooo
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
With yoo ooo
Ooo ooo cos they're watching
Yoo ooo[Sax Solo]
[Chorus]
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
With yoo ooo
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
With yoo ooo
Ooo ooo cos they're watching
Yoo ooo
[Verse 3]
You are just a victim
You are just a find
Soon to be a casuality
A casuality of time
[Verse 2]
You are just a symbol
You are just a theme
You're just another figure
For the sales machine
[Chorus]
Ooo ooo they're obsessed
