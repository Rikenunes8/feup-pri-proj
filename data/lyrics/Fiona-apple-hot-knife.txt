If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing a dancing bird of paradise
If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing a dancing bird of paradise
He excites me
Must be like the Genesis of Rhythm
I get feisty
Whenever I'm with him
If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope screen
Showing a dancing bird of paradise
[Maggart]
I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife
I'm a hot knife, he's a pat of butter
If I get a chance, I’m gonna show him that
He’s never gonna need another, never need another

Maybe he could teach me something

Even just to reach is a triumph
(He makes my heart a cinemascope screen)
