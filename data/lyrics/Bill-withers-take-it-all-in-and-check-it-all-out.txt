[Verse]
You can fill up a room with idle conversation
You can stir up a whole darn nation with your mouth
But before you start to show your indignation about a situation
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
You can create a boom with catchy information
You can shake up a lot of people if you shout
But before you begin to grin about the success of your creation
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
You can make out a plan with aimless dedication
You can hang up a million slogans in your house
But before you put it into operation, before you man your station
Now you ought to take it all in and check it all out
[Outro]
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
Find out what it's all about, uh-huh
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
Find out what it's all about, uh-huh
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
You ought to take it all in and check it all out
Find out what it's all about
