[Verse 1]
And the sky was made of amethyst
And all the stars were just like little fish
You should learn when to go
You should learn how to say, "No"
[Interlude]
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
[Pre-Chorus]
When they get what they want
And they never want it again
When they get what they want
And they never want it again
[Chorus]
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
[Verse 2]
And the sky was all violet
I want it again, but violent, more violent
Yeah, I'm the one with no soul
One above and one below
[Interlude]
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
[Pre-Chorus]
When they get what they want
And they never want it again
When they get what they want
And they never want it again[Chorus]
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I dare you to
[Verse 3]
Well, I told you from the start
Just how this would end
When I get what I want
And I never want it again
[Chorus]
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
[Bridge]
It's my lie
You're mine, you're mine
[Chorus]
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything
Take everything
Take everything
