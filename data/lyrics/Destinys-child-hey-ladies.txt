[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that
We never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her money
Now how he gonna give her my ends?
That's a no-no
My first reactions telling me he's got to go, go
But I just ain't for sure
Should I just let him go?
Oh, I don't know
[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child / (Beyoncé)]
Yeah, he did me wrong
But I love him so
I keep holdin' on
But he got to go, he's got to go (got to go)
Thought he was the one
But now, I don't know (know)
After what he's done
He's got to go, he's got to go (got to go)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Hey, ladies (whoa)
Why is it that men can go do us wrong? (do us wrong)
Why is it that (wrong)
We just decide to keep holdin' on? (holdin' on)
Why is it that
We never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go (got to go)
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on? (holdin' on)
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
You keep rewindin' it
Stoppin' it, and playin' yourself over again
See, I'm sick and tired of you doin' that same old thing
Sick of your same routine
Now you've got to come clean
'Cause it's killing me, oh
[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child / (Beyoncé)]
Yeah, he did me wrong
But I love him so
I keep holdin' on
But he got to go, he's got to go (got to go)
Thought he was the one
But now, I don't know (but I don't know)
After what he's done
He's got to go, he's got to go (he's got to go, whoa)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong? (do us wrong)
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on? (holdin' on)
Why is it that
We never seem to just have the strength to leave? (have the strength to leave)
But he's got to go, he's got to go
Hey, ladies (ladies)
Why is it that men can go do us wrong? (ladies)
Why is it that (we're holdin' on)
We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I just don't understand
You get chance after chance
And you say that you'll do right
But I really do not know if you can
It's not in your plans
That you've shown
Can you change?
Don't think so
Now I gotta let you go
Got to go-go-go-go-go
Got to go, go-go-go-go-whoa
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that
We never seem to just have the strength to leave? (seem to just have the strength to leave)
But he's got to go, he's got to go
Hey, ladies (ladies)
Why is it that men can go do us wrong? (ladies)
Why is it that (do us wrong)
We just decide to keep holdin' on? (oh)
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go (go)
Hey, ladies (ladies)
Why is it that men can go do us wrong? (ladies)

We just decide to keep holdin' on? (oh, ladies)
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave? (ladies)
But he's got to go, he's got to go
