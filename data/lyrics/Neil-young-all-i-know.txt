I'm waitin' for the boys to bring the truck in
They shoulda been here by now
It's way past 4:20 and I'm sittin' waitin'
For the boys to come get the goods

It's loaded on the porch all ready to go
She wants to know where they are
Lookin' for the headlights coming through the trees
I'm standing here waitin' on the porch
They're coming down the highway, just made the turn
They called to let me know
She's asking me again and the smoke that I burn
Keeps taking me to the old days

Well, the jury is out on the old days, you know
The judgement is soon comin' down
I can't quite remember what it was that I knew

I'm waitin' on the headlights to come through the snow
The weather's changin', you know
They shoulda been here about an hour ago
She says that's what she thought
But I can't see 'em and that's all I know
I wonder if they might be lost
