[Chorus]
Always wanting you, but never having you
Makes it hard to face tomorrow
'Cause I know I'll wake up wanting you again
Always loving you, but never touching you
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand
[Verse 1]
I'd have been better off if I'd turned away
And never looked at you the second time
'Cause I really had my life all together
Till your eyes met mine
[Verse 2]
And there I saw a yearning and a feeling
Across the room that you fell for me
Wish I'd had a way of knowing that the things
We had in mind could never be
[Chorus]
Always wanting you, but never having you
Makes it hard to face tomorrow
'Cause I know I'll wake up wanting you again
Always loving you, but never touching you
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand
