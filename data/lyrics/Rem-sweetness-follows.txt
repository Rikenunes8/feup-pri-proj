[Verse 1]
Readying to bury your father and your mother
What did you think when you lost another?
I used to wonder why did you bother
Distanced from one, blind to the other
Listen here, my sister and my brother
What would you care if you lost the other?
I always wonder why did we bother
Distanced from one, blind to the other
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, but sweetness follows
[Verse 2]
It's these little things, they can pull you under
Live your life filled with joy and wonder
I always knew this altogether thunder
Was lost in our little lives
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, but sweetness follows
Oh, oh, but sweetness follows
[Verse 3]
It's these little things, they can pull you under
Live your life filled with joy and thunder
Yeah, yeah, we were all together
Lost in our little lives
[Chorus]
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh, oh, but sweetness follows
Oh, oh, oh, but sweetness follows
