[Verse 1]
I used to live in a two-room apartment
Neighbors knocking on my wall
Times were hard, I don't wanna knock it
I don't miss it much at all
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm alright
I just feel a little lonely tonight
I'm okay most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight
[Verse 2]
Well, I used to need your love so badly
Then I came to live with it
Lately I get a faraway feeling
And the whole thing starts again
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm alright
I just feel a little lonely tonight
I'm okay most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight
[Instrumental bridge][Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm alright
I just feel a little lonely tonight
I'm okay most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight
