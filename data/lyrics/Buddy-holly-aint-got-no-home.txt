[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
I ain't got no home
No place to roam
I ain't got no home
No place to roam
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home
[Verse 2]
I got a voice
And I love to sing
I can sing like a girl
And I can sing like a frog
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 3]
I ain't got a man
I ain't got no one
I ain't got a daughter
I ain't got no boy
I'm a lonely girl
I ain't got a home
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh[Verse 4]
I ain't got a father
I ain't got a mother
I ain't got a sister
Not even a brother
I'm a lonely frog
I ain't got a home
[Verse 5]
What you say to me
Please say to me
What you say to me
Please say to me
I'm a lonely frog
I ain't got a home
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
