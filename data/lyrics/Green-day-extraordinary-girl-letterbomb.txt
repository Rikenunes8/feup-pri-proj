"Extraordinary Girl"
]
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
She's an extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away
He lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain
[Chorus]
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
[Verse 2]
She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss
From her heart's apocalypse
From the one called Whatsername
[Chorus]
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 2]
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
Some days it's not worth trying
Now that they both are finding
She gets so sick of crying[Outro]
She's an extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl

"Letterbomb"
]
[Intro - Kathleen Hanna]
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Having fun
[Verse 1]
Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunkie only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse![Pre-Chorus]
The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life
[Chorus]
It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'
It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There's nothing left to analyze
[Bridge]
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?
[Ad Lib]
And don't look back
[Middle Eight]
You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America
[Chorus 2]
It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'
It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
[Outro]
She said "I can't take this place
I'm leaving it behind"
Well she said "I can't take this town
I'm leaving you tonight"
