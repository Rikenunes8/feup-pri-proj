[Intro]
Uh
Pump, pump, woo!
Come on
Uh
[Verse 1]
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion drawn up by the thoughts I think
[Interlude]
Yeah
Come on
The militant poet in once again, check it
[Verse 2]
It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sendin' us to early graves for all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry, I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?
[Refrain]
(Anger is a gift)
[Interlude]
Come on
Uh
[Guitar Solo][Interlude]
Drop that
Uh
Come on
Yeah
Uh
[Verse 3]
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin' Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, 
three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding
On the level of our unconsciousness
For example, what does the billboard say?
"Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement"
[Refrain]
(Anger is a gift)
[Interlude]
Yeah
Uh
Aw, bring that shit in
Uh
Hey[Outro]
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
