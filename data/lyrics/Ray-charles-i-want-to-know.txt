Now when my heart (I want to know)
Write me pain (I want to know)
And my best friends (I want to know)
Scandalize my name (I want to know)
Yeah I wanna know (I want to know)
Said I wanna know (I want to know)
I wanna know (I want to know)
Do you hear my plea? (I want to know)
Now when I'm down (Yes yes yes)
Yeah, pick me up (Yes yes yes)
And stand by me (Oh stand by me)
Now I'm in this world (I want to know)
All alone (I want to know)
I ain't got nobody (I want to know)
To call my own (I want to know)
Well, I wanna know (I want to know)
Said, I wanna know (I want to know)
I wanna know (I want to know)
Will you hear my plea? (I want to know)
Now when I'm down (Yes yes yes)
Please pick me up (Yes yes yes)
Yea and stand by me (Oh stand by me)
Now you've heard my song (I want to know)
And my song is through (I want to know)
So remember, baby (I want to know)
I'm depending on you (I want to know)
Hell, I wanna know (I want to know)
I wanna know (I want to know)
Yeah I wanna know (I want to know)
Will you hear my plea? (I want to know)
Now when I'm down (Yes yes yes)
Hey Lord, pick me up (Yes yes yes)
And stand by me (Oh stand by me)
Stand by me
