[Verse 1]
There's a cloud in the sky
And it's raining on you
Still you try to keep dry
But your troubles leak through
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you've lost all you could, feeling sad
Choose your reveries
Keep the good, leave the bad
[Chorus]
Take a few of these, the sweeter memories
Don't forget them please, the sweeter memories
Set your mind at ease, the truest remedies
Are the sweeter memories
[Verse 2]
There's a life full of pain
And a life full of glee
So you see that the rain
Doesn't mean much to me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
For I know that it pays
Making light of living's tragedies
Make your days be as bright
[Chorus]
Take a few of these, the sweeter memories
Don't forget them please, the sweeter memories
The truest remedies to set your mind at ease
Are the sweeter memories
