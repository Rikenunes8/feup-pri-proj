[Verse 1]
I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm lookin' forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you lose the love you gave someone
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doin' fine all alone
But where do I go from here
[Chorus]
'Cause without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you
[Verse 2]
Well I never thought I'd be
Lyin' here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me
That the life you promised was a lie
[Pre-Chorus]
You made it look so easy
Makin' love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me[Chorus]
'Cause without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you
[Bridge]
Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
'Cause, baby, I can't live
[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you
