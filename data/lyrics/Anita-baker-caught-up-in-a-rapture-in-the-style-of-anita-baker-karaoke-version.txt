When we met, always knew
I would feel that magic for you
On my mind constantly
In my arms is where you should be

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly freely
I want you in my life for all time
I’m caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you

We stand side by side
'Til the storms of life pass us by
Light my life, warm my heart
Say tonight will be just the start

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly freely
I want you in my life for all time

I’m caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
The feeling's always new
Caught up in the rapture of you


I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly freely
I want you in my life for all time
I’m caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
The feeling's always new
Caught up in the rapture of you
I’m caught up in the rapture of love
I’m caught up in the rapture of love
