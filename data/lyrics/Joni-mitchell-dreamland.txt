[Verse 1]
It's a long, long way from Canada
A long way from snow chains
Donkey vendors slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
We're going to lay down someplace shady
With dreamland coming on
[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland
[Verse 2]
Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus
Come a-marching out of the waves
And claim the beach and all concessions
In the name of the suntan slave
I wrapped that flag around me
Like a 
Dorothy Lamour sarong
And I lay down thinking national
With dreamland coming on
[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland
[Verse 3]
Goodtime Mary and a fortune hunter
All dressed up to follow the drums
Mary in a feather hula-hoop
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun
All saints, all sinners shining
Heed those trumpets all night long
Propped up on a samba beat
With dreamland coming on
[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland[Verse 4]
Tar baby and the Great White Wonder
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With the knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn
As they lead toward temptation
With dreamland coming on
[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland
[Verse 5]
In a plane flying back to winter
In shoes full of tropic sand
A lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro Man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland[Bridge]
La, la, la la
Da, da, da, da
African sand on the trade winds
And the sun on the Amazon
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
[Chorus]
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland
