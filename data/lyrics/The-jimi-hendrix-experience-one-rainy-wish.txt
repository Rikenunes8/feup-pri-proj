[Chorus]
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
Misty blue and the lilac too
Never to grow old
[Verse 1]
There you were under the tree of song
Sleeping so peacefully
In your hand a flower played
Waiting there for me
[Verse 2]
I have never laid eyes on you
Not before this timeless day
But you woke and you
Once smiled my name
And you stole my heart away
Stole my heart away little girl, yeah
All right!
[Chorus]
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
Misty blue and the lilac too
Never to grow old[Chorus]
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Misty blue and the lilac too
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had
Misty blue and the lilac too
Gold and rose, gold and rose, gold and rose
[Verse 3]
It's only a dream
But I'd love to tell somebody about this dream
The sky was filled with a thousand stars
While the sun kissed the mountains blue
And eleven moons
Played across the rainbows
Above me and you
[Outro]
Gold and rose
The color of the velvet walls surrounds us
