[Chorus]
Deny, you're such a liar
Wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the eye
Deny, you're such a liar
Sellin' your no-no all the time
[Verse 1]
And you said we were goin' out to The Hundred Club
Then you said, "It ain't my scene"
Then you turned up alone
Then you turned up alone
[Chorus]
Deny, you're such a liar
Wouldn't know the truth hit you in the street
Deny, you're such a liar
You're sellin' your no-no all the time
[Verse 2]
Then said you'd given it up
Gone and kicked it in the head
You said you ain't had none for weeks
Baby, I seen your arms
Baby, I seen your arms
[Chorus]
Deny, you're such a liar
Wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the eye
Deny, you're such a liar
Sellin' your no-no all the time
[Bridge]
Do you think I'm a ravin' idiot?
Just got off the boat
"Step in line, sign this form"
Baby, ain't got a heart
You ain't got a hope[Outro]
Deny, you're such a liar
Deny, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Let's hear it for true love
You know, like in the 12P comic
In a room filled with scream
A-with ice cream
Boy meets girl
Somebody gets run over
Oh, everybody cried
But I don't know why
I'm a fool, I can't control
I've read a-one too many books
I believe everything I read
What they've written in the Slutsville paper
Deny, you're such a lie
(What a liar, what a liar, what a liar)
(What a liar)
