[Verse 1]
There hasn't been one bit of laughter in this house in so long
Just the howling of the wind asking why
And I know this house ain't growing
But it seems bigger since you're gone
And this loneliness is eating me alive
[Verse 2]
If there's any forgiveness in you, wrap it up and come on home
I may not change completely, oh but I'll try
And honey, you have to hurry
Or there'd be no reason to come home
'Cause this loneliness is eating me alive
[Verse 3]
The bigger the house, the harder the tear falls
I found it out since your goodbye
And honey, you'll have to hurry
Or there'll be no reason to come home
'Cause this loneliness is eating me alive
Yeah, this loneliness is eating me alive
