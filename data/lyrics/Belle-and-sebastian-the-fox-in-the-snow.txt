[Verse 1]
Fox in the snow, where do you go
To find something you could eat?
Because the word out on the street is you are starving
Don't let yourself grow hungry now, don't let yourself grow cold
Fox in the snow
[Verse 2]
Girl in the snow, where do you go
To find someone who will do?
To tell someone all the truth before it kills you
And listen to your crazy laugh before you hang a right
And disappear from sight
[Chorus 1]
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book tonight
[Verse 3]
Boy on the bike, what are you like
As you cycle round the town?
You're going up, you're going down, you're going nowhere
It's not as if they're paying you, it's not as if it's fun
At least not anymore[Chorus 2]
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a break
When your legs are black and blue
Time to take a holiday
[Verse 4]
Kid in the snow, way to go
It only happens once a year
It only happens once a lifetime, make the most of it
Second just to being born, second to dying too
What else would you do?
[Outro]
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
Fox in the snow (When your legs are black and blue)
Fox in the snow (It's not as if they're paying you)
Fox in the snow (When your legs are black and blue)
Fox in the snow (It's not as if they're paying you)
Fox in the snow
Fox in the snow
