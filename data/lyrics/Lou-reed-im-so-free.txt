[Verse 1]
Yes I am mother nature's son
And I'm the only one
I do what I want and I want what I see
Huh, could only happen to me
[Chorus]
I'm so free
I'm so free
[Verse 2]
Oh, please, Saint Germaine
I have come this way
Do you remember the shape I was in
I had horns and fins
[Chorus]
I'm so free
I'm so free
[Verse 3]
Do you remember the silver walks
You used to shiver and I used to talk
Then we went down to Times Square
And ever since I've been hanging around there
[Chorus]
I'm so free
I'm so free
[Verse 1]
Yes I am mother nature's son
And I'm the only one
I do what I want and I want what I see
Could only happen to me
[Chorus]
I'm so free
I'm so free
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
In the morning, I'm so free
Late in the evening, I'm so free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free
When I feel good, I'm so free
When it's in the morning, I'm so free
When it's in the evening, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
Feel so good, now, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
Feel so good, now, I'm so free
Feeling real nice, I'm so free
Really mellow down, now, I'm so free
Oh so good, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
