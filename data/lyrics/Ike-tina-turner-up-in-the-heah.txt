You're nothin' but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinkin' with a one-track mind
You keep preachin' 'bout heaven and glory
But on your face, it shows a different story

Clean up your rep, your story's gettin' dusty
Wash out your mouth, your lies are gettin' rusty
I can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do

You know you're funkier than a mosquita's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same ol' game, you never change
Always rappin' 'bout the same ol' thing

Blowin' minds is the thing of the past
You blew your chance, that's why it'll never last
You wanna be a graduated lover
But in reality, you're just another brother

You think you're slick, but you can stand a little greasin'
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'
I can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you're funkier than a mosquita's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same ol' thing, you never change
Always rappin' 'bout the same ol' thing
You know you're funkier

You put yourself upon a big stool
Nothin' worse than an educated fool
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation
But peace and love is a famous generation

What's in your head has really started showin'
Your conversation is gettin' kinda borin'

You're funkier than a mosquita's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same ol' thing, you never change
Always rappin' 'bout the same ol' thing
You know you're funkier than a mosquita's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd
