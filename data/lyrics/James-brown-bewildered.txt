Bewildered
Has love died, dear?
Wishing your heart could feel
What's in my heart, what's in my heart, what's in my heart
Bewildered
I need your, I need your guiding hand
I'll never, I'll never, I'll never understand
Must I have sleepless night, oh darling
And endless days
Oh love, why, why did you keep my soul
Without a spark, oh, I'm in the dark. baby
Bewildered
I need your, I need your guiding hand
I'll never understand, I'll never understand
How you can love me and leave me bewildered
How you can love me and leave me bewildered
Bewildered
How you, how you can love me, and leave me
How you can love me and leave me bewildered
