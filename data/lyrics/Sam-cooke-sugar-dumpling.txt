Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day
Yeah
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day
Listen how I tell you a story
A story about my girl
And I call hear Sugar dumpling
Because she's the sweetest things in this world
Whenever I'm feeling bad
By the way she puts me to bad
And she hides two mercys
One to hold my hand
The other one to rub my hand
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day
Whenever I tell her honey I'm hungry
Now go and fix me something to eat
The girl rushes in the kitchen
And fixes me a dinner
With seven different kinds of meat
If I call her up at two o'clock in the morning
And come over if you can
Before I hang up to telephone
She's sitting beside me
With a cup of coffee in her handSugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day
Sugar dumpling, I love you in every way
Sugar dumpling, my love grows stronger every day
