[Verse 1]
Everywhere I hear the sound
Of marching, charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
For fighting in the street, boy
[Chorus]
Well, what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
[Verse 2]
Hey, think the time is right
For a palace revolution
'Cause where I live the game to play
Is compromise solution
[Chorus]
Well, then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down
[Verse 3]
Hey, said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king
I'll rail at all his servants
[Chorus]
Well, then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band?
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down
