[Chorus]
She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it
I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
—up
[Chorus]
She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it
I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
—up
[Bridge]
Why not leave why not, go away
Too much hatred, corruption and greed
Give your life, and invariably they leave you with nothing
[Verse]
Young girl ain't got no chances
No roots to keep her strong
She's shed all pretences
That someday she'll belong
Some folks call her a runaway
A failure in the race
But she knows where her ticket takes her
She will find her place in the sun
[Bridge]
Why not leave why not, go away
Too much hatred, corruption and greed
Give your life, and invariably they leave you with nothing
[Chorus]
She's got her ticket, I think she gonna use it
I think she goin' to fly away
No one should try and stop her, persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
—up[Post-Chorus]
And she'll fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly
[Outro]
And she gotta fly away
Oh she got her ticket
Oh she got her ticket
No, she gonna fly away
Oh, she gonna fly away
Yeah, she gonna fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Oh, she gonna fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Yeah, she gonna fly, fly, fly
