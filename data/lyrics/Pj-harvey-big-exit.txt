[Verse 1]
Look out ahead
See danger come
I want a pistol
I want a gun
I'm scared baby
I wanna run
This world's crazy
Give me the gun
[Chorus]
Baby, baby
Ain't it true
I'm immortal
When I'm with you
But I want a pistol
In my hand
I wanna go to
A different land
[Verse 2]
I met a man
He told me straight
"You gotta leave
It's getting late"
Too many cops
Too many guns
All trying to do something
No one else has done
[Chorus]
Baby, baby
Ain't it true
I'm immortal
When I'm with you
But I want a pistol
In my hand
I wanna go to
A different land
[Bridge]
Sometimes it rains so hard
And I feel the hurt
In my heart
Feels like the end of the world
And I see the children
As sharp as knives
And I see the children
Dead end lives
Beautiful people
Beautiful girls
I just feel like
It's the end of the world[Verse 3]
I walk on concrete
I walk on sand
But I can't find
A safe place to stand
I'm scared baby
I wanna run
This world's crazy
Give me the gun
[Chorus]
Baby, baby
Ain't it true
I'm immortal
When I'm with you
But I want a pistol
In my hand
I wanna go to
A different land
