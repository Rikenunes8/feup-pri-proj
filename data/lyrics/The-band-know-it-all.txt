Know it all
Know it all

Somebody told me that you found somebody new and you're happy
You were never really very good at being alone
Apparently, it's getting serious, so whatever that means
I'm sure you told him I was just somebody you used to know, oh, oh

I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all)
No, he don't know that you and me had something chemical (Chemical)
The things you said to me when we were drunk in Montreal (Montreal)
I bet you told him about me, but I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all, know it all)
Do you remember when the world was in the walls of your bedroom?
And everything you said to me was like a line in a song
I still remember what it felt like the first time I had you
And now he probably thinks that all your feelings for me are gone
And maybe they're gone

I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all)
No, he don't know that you and me had something chemical (Chemical)
The things you said to me when we were drunk in Montreal (Montreal)
I bet you told him about me, about me
And I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all)
Like why you love the color yellow but you hate the song (Hate the song)
And how you told me I would always be the only one (Only one)
I bet you told him about me, but I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all, know it all)


Honestly, I hope you're happy, hope you're doing well
I still keep your secrets even though you're with someone else

I know he doesn't know it all
No, he don't know that you and me had something chemical
The things you said to me when we were drunk in Montreal
I bet you told him about me, about me
But I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all)
Like why you love the color yellow but you hate the song (Hate the song)
And how you told me I would always be the only one (Only one)
I bet you told him about me, but I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all, know it all)
I know he doesn't know it all (Know it all, know it all)
I know he doesn't know it all
