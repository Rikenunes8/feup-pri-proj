[Intro]
You know I'm almost grown
[Verse 1]
Yeah and I'm doing all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't carouse around too much
Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown
[Verse 2]
I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm going to buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park
Don't bother us, leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown
[Verse 3]
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
Now I take her to a dance
We started talkin' about romance
Don't bother us, leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
You know I'm still living in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all
Don't bother us, leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown
