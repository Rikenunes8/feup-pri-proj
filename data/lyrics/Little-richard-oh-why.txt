[Verse 1]
Dreamed I was arrested
Charged with a crime
Forgot to plead innocent
'Cause darling, you're not mine
[Chorus]
Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me
[Verse 2]
The policeman said maybe
The judge he can agree
The jury keep on guessing
But the DA says it's me
[Chorus]
Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me
[Verse 3]
The lawyer said plead guilty
And try to cop a plea
But why should I try plead guilty
When you don't belongs to me?
[Chorus]
Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me
[Verse 2]
The policeman said maybe
The judge he can agree
The jury keep on guessing
But the DA says it's me[Chorus]
Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me
