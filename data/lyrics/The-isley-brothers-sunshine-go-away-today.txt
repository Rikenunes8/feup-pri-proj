[Chorus]
Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
[Verse 1]
He tells me I'd better get in line
Can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up I'm going to make it mine
But these ain't dues I been paying
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna ask y'all
How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't run his life
No, he can't run his own life
He can't even run his life
He can't run his life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine
Ah, sunshine
[Chorus]
Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, tryin' to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
[Verse 2]
Working starts to make me wonder where
The fruits of what I do are going
He says in love and war all is fair
But he's got cards he ain't showing
[Outro]
I wanna ask y'all
How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't run his life
No, he can't run his own life
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
The man can't run his life
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
No, he can't
He can't run his life
No, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
How can you tell me
He can't run his life
When a man can't run his own
He can't run his life
I don't need
He can't run his life
I'll be damned
He can't run his life
If he'll run mine
Ah, sunshine
Go away
Go away
Ah, sunshine, go away
