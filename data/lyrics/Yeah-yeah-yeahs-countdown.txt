[Verse 1]
Trailer red like the sea
Well, I'm a sun of a crowded bed
Will find your love's going to pout for me
Your love that breathes breeds
Going to paste up high in his
Going to drive, going to drive, going to pout for me
Your love that breeds breeze
Your love that's catching the breeze
[Hook]
Son of a crowded bed
Son of a crowded night
Will find your love's going to pout for me
Your love's going to pout for me
Well, countdown
Well, countdown [x7]
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Waiting for a chance to pass
Some hoes say, some say now go
Working for a chance for speak
A love that breeds breeze
Hard time getting past black
Going to drop, going to drop, going to pop for me
Your love that breathes breeze
Your love that's catching the breeze
[Hook]
