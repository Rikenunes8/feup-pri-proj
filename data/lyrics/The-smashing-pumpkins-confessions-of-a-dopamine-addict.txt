[Verse 1]
Love is easy
Whichever way you start
Taking a diamond
Slice it through your heart
And watch what color bleeds
Task which sweetness
Decimation stings
For inamorata and swan-like swain
For valentine and twinning flame
On whiff of pain and cross
Your cedar burns, aflame
[Bridge]
I'm down for bewitching trains
And cursed tower
Masts blacked windswept
Horizons ever sour
If it takes more to find you
Than setting out a faded sun
[Chorus]
Can you feel the same?
Do the stars inked on my face
State what's changed?
With a distance I can't make
From a distance I can't make[Verse 2]
For Tango-Smith and cantor camoused
For anguished scrive and maelstrom mouse
On scent of pain and cross
Your cedar burns, aflame at loss
[Chorus]
Can you feel the same?
Do the stars inked on my face
State what's changed?
With a distance I can't make
From a distance I can't make
[Bridge]
I'm down for bewitching trains
And cursed tower
Masts blacked windswept
Horizons ever sour
If it takes more to find you
Than setting out a faded sun
[Verse 3]
Love is easy
Whichever way you start
Taking a diamond
Slice it through your heart[Chorus]
Can you feel the same?
Do the stars inked on my face
State what's changed?
With a distance I can't make
From a distance I can't make
