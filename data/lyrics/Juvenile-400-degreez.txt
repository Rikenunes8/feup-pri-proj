400 Degreez
[Verse 1]
Ya see, me, I eat, sleep, shit and talk rap
Ya seen that '98 Mercedes on TV? I bought that
I had some felony charges, I fought that
Been sent to no return, but still was brought back
Nigga threw some slangs at me wodie, I caught that
And punished them lil' bitches before they could carjack
Now I'm lookin' for they family and partners to war back
If I ain't a Hot Boy, then what do you call that?
Nigga disrespect me, I'ma be in all black
Accompanied by some niggas 'bout killin' and all that
Me, Cory and Rusty getting ducked off
Ride top down so we let the trucks park
In the jeep ridin' four-deep
I'm booted up at these nigga claimin' they know me
[Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with me
[Verse 2]
Bitch, what? I'll bust your ass up
Don't even go there, 
wodie
, 'cause I'm ready to mask up
I heard about the money, that's some nice change
For the right price, I'll bust the right brain
Why must a nigga try? I can't do the right thing
Only God knows what the future might bring
Nigga might be shy, nigga might be triflin'
Nigga might survive if he 'bout that rifling
With somethin' that'll stop a nigga from playin'
Somethin' like a chopper or a grenade in his hand
Boy, look, nigga don't play no games no more
Nigga'll bust ya head if you bang his ho
Attitude adjustments they all need
Don't call in those enforcements, nigga, call me
I bet ya I'll get them niggas off your block
I bet ya I'll show them niggas this boy hot
[Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with me
Hot Boy, hot, hot, Hot Boy, hot, hot
Hot Boy, hot, hot, Hot Boy[Verse 3]
Alright, stop it, 'cause I done had enough
When it comes to my pockets, I'm ready to bust
Baby, let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Man, let me get this beef shit over, bruh
Ain't no bitches here, I'm from the 'Nolia, bruh
Bust your beef head is what was told to us
How I'ma be runnin' with these killas and backin' down?
How I'ma look in front of my people like a clown?
The G code what we live by and we die by
The book is what we will never abide by
Niggas drive by, gettin' loose
Beefing with each other like the Checker Board and Goose
Up in Compton or the Watts, nigga
Up in New York ya keep' 'em open, watch, nigga
'Fore ya played by a bit' or battalion
All fine young Black females stallions
Give me the keys to ya car and ya medallion
You far away from ya home, you's an alien
[Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with me
You don't want to fuck with me
You don't want to fuck with me
You don't want to fuck with me, with me[Outro]
