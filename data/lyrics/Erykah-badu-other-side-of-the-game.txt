Whatcha gonna do when they come for you
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
What we gonna do when they come for you
Gave me the life that I came to live

Do I really
Want my baby
Brother tell me what to do
I know you got to get your hustle on
So I pray
I understand the game, sometimes
And I love you strong, but
What you gonna do when they come for you
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills (Yes, it does)
What we gonna do when they come for you
God I can't stand life withoutcha

Now, me and baby got this situation
See, brother got this complex occupation
And it ain't that he don't have education
'Cause I was right there at his graduation
Now, I ain't sayin' that this life don't work
But, it's me and baby that he hurts
'Cause I tell him right
He thinks I'm wrong
But I love him strong
He gave me the life that I came to live
Gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure on me
But the seed had grown
I can't make it on my own
Summer came around and the flowers bloomed
He became the sun
I became the moon
Precious gifts that we both received
Or could this be make believe
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
(Work ain't honest but it pays the bills)
What we gonna do when they come for you
Gave me the life that I came to live
Yes, you did

Don't worry baby
I know there's confusion
God's gonna see us through (yeah)
Peace out to revolution
But we paid though

Don't you worry, keep your balance
(What you gonna do, What you gonna do)
The work ain't honest but it pays the bills
(Yes it does)
Don't you worry, keep your balance
(Don't have to worry baby)
Gave me the life that I came to live
(Yes you did)

Don't you worry, keep your balance
The work ain't honest but it pays the bills
The work ain't honest but it pays the bills
Don't you worry, keep your balance
You gave me the life that I came to live
Gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure on me
But the seed had grown
I can't make it on my own
Summer came around and the flowers bloomed
He became the sun, I became the moon
Precious gifts that we both received
Or could this be make believe
