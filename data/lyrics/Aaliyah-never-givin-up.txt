[Chorus]
Never givin' up on this love
(Never givin' up on this love)
You're all I'm thinkin' of
[Verse 1]
Sittin' here in this empty room
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Thinking 'bout all the changes we been through
And I know it might sound crazy but I'm still lovin' you
In spite of all the simple things
We been through, we been through
[Pre-Chorus]
The way you make me feel I can't explain
But I love what you do, what you do to me
When we're making love, you're drivin' me insane
See, I can't go no higher
[Chorus]
Never givin' up on this love
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(You're always on my mind, all the time)
Never givin' up on this love
(I'll always be there, babe)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
[Verse 2: Tavarius Polk]
Well, well, well
Feels so strange when I was on the train
I cracked a smile on every thought of you
The things that you do
Makes me feel so good inside
No need to lie, I'm on your side
Oh, no need to lie to you
I'm givin' my lovin' to you day and night
Aaliyah, I'm gonna be lovin' you
Oh, baby girl[Hook: Aaliyah & Tavarius Polk]
I got what you want!
I got what you need!
It's all in me!
[Hook: Tavarius Polk]
Oh, oh, I'm
No, I'm never ever ever givin' your love away
I gotta keep it to myself, no
[Verse 3: Aaliyah]
Tavarius, if you say what you think
And you mean what you say
My love, my love will be here always
Lately I've had the strangest feeling
A feeling I can't deny
That angels watchin' over us and our love
[Bridge]
Angels watchin' over you, over me
(Baby)
Angels watchin' over you, over me
(Over you and me, hey)
Angels watchin' over you, over me
(Watchin' over you and me, baby)
Angels watchin over you, over me
(And I gotta thank the Lord for givin' you to me)[Chorus]
Never givin' up on this love
(Yes I do, yes I do)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(See, they can take my prized possessions, baby)
Never givin' up on this love
(Don't take your love away)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(I said I'm never goin' away)
[Outro]
Never givin' up on this love
(No way, no way, no way)
(No, no, no, no)
Never givin' up, you're all I'm thinkin' of
(No)
Never givin' up on this love
