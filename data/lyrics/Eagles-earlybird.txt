[Verse]
Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away
Spends his days denying that
He's got no time for flying
In the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
And he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
The going's getting tough
Time is passing by him and he just
Can't get enough
He'll tell you all is going well
Though knows that something's wrong
The earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
Just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
And sets my mind at ease to
Know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please
[Outro]
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
