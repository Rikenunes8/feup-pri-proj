[Verse 1]
I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
Seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?
[Chorus]
Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that, I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me, I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship-ship-ship-ship?
[Verse 2]
I came and took your love, I took your body
Took the self-respect you ever had
I took you for a ride and, baby, I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that, I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you lеft me, I just might do something rash
What's this strange rеlationship-ship-ship-ship?
[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo[Verse 3]
Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie?
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, but I'm only human
Didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine
[Chorus]
Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that, I hate to see you sad, hey-hey
Honey, if you left me, I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship-ship-ship-ship?
[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
[Bridge]
Such a strange relationship
[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
