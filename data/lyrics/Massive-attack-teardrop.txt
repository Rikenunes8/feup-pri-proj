[Verse 1]
Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
[Chorus]
Teardrop on the fire
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
[Verse 2]
Night, night of matter
Black flowers blossom
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
Black flowers blossom
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
[Chorus]
Teardrop on the fire
[Feathers/Fearless] on my...
[Verse 3]
Water is my eye
Most faithful mirror
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
Teardrop on the fire

[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
Most faithful mirror
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
[Chorus]
Teardrop on the fire
[Feathers/Fearless] on my breath
[Outro]
You're stumbling in the dark
You're stumbling in the dark
