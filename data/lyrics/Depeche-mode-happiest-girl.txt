[Chorus 1]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew
[Verse 1]
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our lips
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our hips
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do
Happiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew
[Verse 2]
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our eyes
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our thighs
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
And I would have to pinch her
Just to see if she was real
Just to watch the smile fade away
And see the pain she'd feel
[Bridge]
Wanted to feel her joy
Feel it deep within
Wanted to feel her joy
Penetrate my skin
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do
[Outro][x5]
Why do you smile the smile you do
