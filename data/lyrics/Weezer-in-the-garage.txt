[Verse 1]
I've got a 
Dungeon Master's Guide
, I've got a twelve sided die
I've got 
Kitty Pryde
, and 
Nightcrawler
 too
Waiting there for me, yes I do, I do
[Verse 2]
I've got posters on the wall, my favorite rock group KISS
I've got Ace Frehley, I've got Peter Criss
Waiting there for me, yes I do, I do
[Chorus]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage
[Verse 3]
I've got electric guitar, I play my stupid songs
I write these stupid words, and I love every one
Waiting there for me, yes I do, I do
[Chorus]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage, in the garage, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
[Outro]
In the garage, I feel safe
No one laughs about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me, no one hears me
No one hears me, no one hears me
No one hears me sing this song
