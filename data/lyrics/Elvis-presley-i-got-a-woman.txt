Well, I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh yeah
Say, I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh yeah
She's gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend to me
I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh-oh yeah

She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah

[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
She's there to love me both day and night
No groans or fusses, just treats me right
Never running in the streets, leaving me alone
She knows a woman's place is right there, now, in her home
I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh-oh yeah
Say, I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh yeah
Well, she's my baby, oh, don't you understand
And I'm her loving man
I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh-oh yeah
[Outro]
Oh, don't you know she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
I got a woman way over town
Good to me, oh yeah
