[Intro: Pharrell]
Hi, baby
What you doing?
Your flight left yet?
Pshh, I'm halfway there
I can't wait to see you
So tell me, have you left yet?
Damn
[Verse 1: Kelis]
I'm running late to the airport
Every time we do this
In my mind saying should I go through with this?
All I see is you kissing me
Last time shut my eyes
Plane goes higher, higher
Hotel's booked
All I have to do is get my key
I can't wait to have you walk up and hold on me, yeah
I've never felt this way before
[Chorus: Kelis]
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
[Verse 2: Kelis]
Casablanca has always been my dream
I heard that it's absolutely radiant in spring
In the garden drinking shots of Hennessy
Calm my nerves, it's been way too long for me
Finally, we're driving in a far out dream
Nothing seems even real or close for me
Afternoon sun showers change the way I see
I've never felt this way before
[Chorus: Kelis]
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight[Bridge: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
It's okay, it's okay
(It's okay)
It's okay, it's okay
Yeah (
Yeah baby
)
[Chorus: Kelis & 
Pharrell
]
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait (
I'll be back
)
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
But in the morning
When you're gone
I must wait
And be strong
And have faith
You'll return
In my arms
Hope you miss your flight
Hope you miss your flight
(
No matter where, baby; no matter where
