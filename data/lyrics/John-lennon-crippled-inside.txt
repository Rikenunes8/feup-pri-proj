[Verse 1]
You can shine your shoes and wear a suit
You can comb your hair and look quite cute
You can hide your face behind a smile
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
[Verse 2]
You can wear a mask and paint your face
You can call yourself the human race
You can wear a collar and a tie
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
[Bridge]
Well now you know that your cat has nine lives
Nine lives to itself
But you only got one and a dog's life ain't fun
Mama take a look outside
[Dobro Solo]
[Verse 3]
You can go to church and sing a hymn
You can judge me by the color of my skin
You can live a lie until you die
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
Take it, cousin!
[Piano Solo]
[Bridge]
Well now you know that your cat has nine lives, babe
Nine lives to itself
You only got one and a dog's life ain't fun
Mama take a look outside
[Verse 3]
You can go to church and sing a hymn
You can judge me by the color of my skin
You can live a lie until you die
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside[Outro]
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
One thing you can't hide
Is when you're crippled inside
