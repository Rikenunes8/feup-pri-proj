[Verse 1: Black Francis]
Hey
Been trying to meet you
Hey, must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at the door, whore in my bed
But hey
Where have you
Been?
If you go, I will surely die
[Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal

[Verse 2: Black Francis]
"Uh!"
Said the man to the lady, mm-hm
"Uh!" Said the lady to the man she adored
And the whores like a choir
Go "Uh!" all night
And Mary, ain't you tired of this?
"Uh!" is the sound
That the mother makes when the baby breaks[Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
