[Verse 1]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change
Still you forced a way into my scheme of things
You say we're growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in Heaven or Hell
[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you 
my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
[Verse 2]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see
I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still glowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
[Bridge]
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh...[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
But it's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
