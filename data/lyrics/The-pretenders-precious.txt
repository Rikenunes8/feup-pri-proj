I like the way you cross the street 'cause you're precious
Moving through the Cleveland heat
, how precious
You're taking nights and all the kicks, you're so precious
But you know I was shittin' bricks 'cause I'm precious
You made me wanna
Made me wanna
You made me make it
Oh, you're so mean
East 55th and Euclid Avenue was real precious
Hotel Sterling
 coming into view, how precious
It's a pity that you bruised my hip 'cause I'm precious
You shouldn't let your manners slip, you're too precious
You made me wanna
Made me wanna
Made me make it
Oh, so mean
Oh, we went around and round and round and round the shoreway
Oh, we was a duet, duet, duet, duet, do it on the pavement
Oh, maybe, maybe I'm gonna have a baby
Oh, we was a duet, oh, we do it all night
I was feeling kind of ethereal 'cause I'm (Precious)
I had my eye on your imperial, you're so (Precious)
Now 
Howard the Duck
 and 
Mister Stress
 both stayed (Precious)
Trapped in a world that they never made
But not me, baby, I'm too precious, I had to fuck off
You made me wanna
You made me wanna
You made me make it
Oh, you're so mean
