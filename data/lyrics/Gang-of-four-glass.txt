[Verse 1]
Look through the window
Look through the window
Look through the window
I'm looking through a pane of glass
[Chorus]
Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
I'm looking through a pane of glass
[Verse 2]
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
We talk about this and we talk about that
[Chorus]
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
We talk about this and we talk about that
[Verse 3]
Light myself
Light myself
Light myself
Nicotine really goes to my head
[Chorus]
Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette
Nicotine really goes to my head

If you're feeling, all in take some asprin
If you feel in a mess, put your head on a head rest
Your back on a back rest, foot on a foot rest
Or your arm on an arm rest or your leg on a leg rest
Your back on a back rest, if you feel in a real mess
When you're feeling all in, take some asprin
Or some paracetamol[Breakdown]

Nothing I do can seem to please me
What I say don't sound so good
[Outro]
I always thought
I always thought
I always thought
It seems that I have misunderstood
