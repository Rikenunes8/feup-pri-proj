I quietly observe, standing in my space
Yes, Daddy
Daydreaming
Massive, Massive, Massive
I quietly observe standing in my space
Daydreaming
[Verse 1: 3D, 
Tricky
 & 
Daddy G

Way that we say 'em in style that we writ 'em in
Massive Attack, we keep it strong just like a vitamin
Going for the positive, wiping out the negative songs
'Cause, brother, it's relative
The passer's picking up all the lyrics on the dance floor
That raise your spirit level 'cause it demands for
Attitude is cool, degrees below zero
Up against the wall, 
behaving like De Niro
Tricky's performing, taking his phono
Making a stand with a tan, touch it like cocoa
Smooth to keep you moving at the back now
Free is the needle, it's moving through the track now
Dance to the drummer's beats, we need new sticks
Bounce around the vibes like acoustics
No drugs or pharmaceuticals, for the body, ain't suitable
Stick with liquid, me and Trick, we drop
A paper which you use my tongue to lick with
Trouble and strife ain't no sunshine in my life
Wiseguys get protection when they carry a knife
They shouldn't have been born, they're making me yawn
But I just take it easy, it's a Sunday morn'
So, you come on light my fire and
Together we'll grow forever, watch my Akai rig go
Because my Akai rig goes boom, boom
My Akai rig goes boom
Yeah, rhymin' the jam and, uh, we got the stamina
In case you never know us if we don't give a damn and uh
And it's hard to handle, keep your distance
Resist and the posse gets the pleasure of this dance
The cool breeze that you welcome in the heat
You don't see it but you feel it when it's blowing on the street
If I was a rich man
Da da dada
I quietly observe, standing in my space
It's the devious days they call the rat race
It's a concrete jungle, evil in the town
Weebles, wobble, occasional squabble
But what happen when the bomb drops Down
Don't make sound, 
yes
'Cause the dance floor's a desert and the dancers are parched
Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh
My heavy, my brother get lighter than helium
Float above the world to break the tedium
Living in my headphones, Sony's what I say to 'em
The surreal boom of the Budokan stadium
[Refrain: Shara Nelson]
Well, I'm floating on air when I'm daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space
[Verse 2: 3D & 
Tricky
]
Well, I'm tricky, kid, don't deal with sadness
Can't be with the one I love, I love the one that I miss
I'm very down to earth but brain sits on top floor
Don't need another lover just need, I'm insecure
The weather is a-changin', the storms be shakin'
The love that you take is equal to the love you're makin'
Here comes the sun little darlin here comes the sun (
It's alright
)
Yes, tricky kid, I check my situation
Maggie this, Maggie that, Maggie means inflation
Hip-hop, you don't stop
, 'cause I'm not sloppy
I like the beat so we need another copy
We're natives of the massive territory and we're proud
Get peaceful in the dance, adapt the glory and the crowd
The problem ain't a different kind of skin tricks
I love my neighbor, I don't wait for the olympics
See you go hooligan, you're trying to play the fool again
Caught you in the lost and found
When your posse weren't around
No craft
So, you're going for you tool again[Refrain: Shara Nelson]
Daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space
Daydreaming
Well I'm floating on air when I'm daydreaming
