[Verse 1]
At home he feels like a tourist
At home he feels like a tourist
He fills his head with culture
He gives himself an ulcer
He fills his head with culture
He gives himself an ulcer
[Chorus]
Down on the disco floor
They make their profit
From the things they sell
To help you cob off
And the rubbers you hide
In your top left pocket
[Verse 2]
At home she's looking for interest
At home she's looking for interest
She said she was ambitious
So she accepts the process
She said she was ambitious
So she accepts the process
[Chorus]
Down on the disco floor
They make their profit
From the things they sell
To help you cob off
And the rubbers you hide
In your top left pocket
[Bridge]
Two steps forward
(Six steps back, six steps back, six steps back, six steps back)
Small step for him
(Big jump for me, big jump for me, big jump for me, big jump for me)
Two steps forward
(Six steps back, six steps back, six steps back, six steps back)
Small step for him
(Big jump for me, big jump for me, big jump for me, big jump for me)[Outro]
At home she feels like a tourist
At home she feels like a tourist
She fills her head with culture
She gives herself an ulcer
Why make yourself so anxious?
You give yourself an ulcer
