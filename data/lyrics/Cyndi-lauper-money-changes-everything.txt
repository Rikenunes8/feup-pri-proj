[Verse 1]
I said, "I'm sorry, baby, I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new
He's waiting in the car outside"
"Aw honey, how could you do it?
We swore each other everlasting love"
I said, "Well yeah, I know, but when we did
There was one thing we weren't thinking of, and that's money"
[Chorus 1]
Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
That don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything
[Verse 2]
They shake your hand
And they smile, and they buy you a drink
They say, "We'll be your friends
We'll stick with you 'til the end"
Ah, but everybody's only looking out for themselves
And you say, "Well who can you trust?"
I'll tell you, it's just nobody else's money
[Chorus 2]
Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
You think you know what you're doing
We don't pull the strings
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money
Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
We don't know a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything[Outro]
Hey, yeah, yeah
Money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah
Money is everything
Money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah, yeah
