[Verse 2]
Chinna girl is a little girl
From a town, that's all ya need to know
Lolita was a maneater
Clocked him like a taximeter
Fuck gold, she was platinum digger
Shakin-ass-making moves on a mover
Visa, then a plane ride to ya
Peace out, she'll kill you like Uma
[Pre-Chorus]
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Chinna girl grew up to be a big girl
Had her sights set on a bigger world
Dial-a-Bride from Sri Lanka
Found herself a Yorkshire banker
Need a Visa? Got with a geezer
Need some money? Paid him with a-knees up
Year later, started to ease-up
Got her own way, shouted out, "See ya!"
[Pre-Chorus]
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop[Refrain]

What can I get for 10 dollar?
Everything you want
And what can I get for 10 dollar?
Anything you want
Yeah, what can I get for 10 dollar?
Everything you want
Yeah, what can I get for 10 dollar?
Anything you want
What can I get for 10 dollar?
Anything you want
And what can I get for 10 dollar?
Anything you want
Yeah, what can I get for 10 dollar?
Anything you want
Yeah, what can I get for 10 dollar?
Anything you want
