[Intro]
[Verse 1]
She saw the look in his eyes
And she knew better
He wanted her tonight, ah
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad
[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
[Verse 2]
Now Jamie wouldn't say alright
She knew he'd forget her
And so they said goodnight, ooh
And now he's gone forever
[Pre-Chorus]
She wants to send him a letter, a-yeah yeah
A-just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her
[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
[Verse 3]
Now Jamie's been in love before (ahh)
And she knows what love is for (ahh)
It should mean, a little, a little more (ahh)
Than one night stands, whoo
[Pre-Chorus]
She wants to send him a letter, a-yeah yeah
Just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
