[Verse 1]
I knew it must've been a-some big set-up
All the action just would not let up
It's just a little bit back from the main road
Where the silence spreads and the men dig holes
[Chorus]
I start to spin the tale
You complain of my diction
You give me friction (Friction!)
You give me friction (Friction!)
You give me friction (Friction!)
[Verse 2]
My eyes are like telescopes
I see it all backwards, but who wants hope?
If I ever catch that ventriloquist
I'll squeeze his head right into my fist
[Chorus:]
Something come a-tracking in
What is it? What's the prediction?
I'll bet you it's friction (Friction!)
I'll betcha it's friction (Friction!)
I'll bet you it's friction (Friction!)
[Verse 3]
How does a snake get out of its skin?
Here's a depiction...
Oh, stop this head motion, set the sails
You know all us boys gonna wind up in jail
[Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna grow up
There's too much contradiction
And too much friction (Friction!)
But I dig friction (Friction!)
You know I'm crazy 'bout friction (Friction!)
F-R-I-C-T-I-O-N[Outro]
(Friction!)
(Friction!)
(Friction!)
