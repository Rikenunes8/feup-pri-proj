[Verse 1]
It was your father who trained you and your mother who brained you
To be so useless and shy
But I just replaced them and tried not to break them
Because you could stand up if you tried
And I wanna see your face when your knees and your legs
Are just gonna break down and die
[Chorus]
And, who's driving your plane?
Who's driving your plane?
Who's driving your plane?
Who's driving your plane?
Are you in control or is it driving you insane?
[Verse 2]
If I could wave a magic wand, then
Maybe you'd change back to bein' a blonde
And your skirt would come down
It would cover your feet
If I said, "It's not camp to wear Tiffany lamps"
You'd be thrown right out in the street
[Chorus]
And I wonder who's driving your plane?
Who's driving your plane?
Who's driving your plane?
Who's driving your plane?
Are you in control or is it driving you insane?
[Verse 3]
You could stand on your head or maybe sing in bed
If I said it was the thing to do
If you're in with the faces and their getaway places
'Cause they don't take no notice of you
Well, the trendy pace-setters will just called you a pain
'Cause I want to know, who's driving your plane?
