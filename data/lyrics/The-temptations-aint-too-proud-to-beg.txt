[Verse 1]
I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me
[Chorus]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
[Verse 2]
Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin'
If it'll keep you by my side
[Chorus]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
[Verse 3]
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can
[Chorus]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
[Instrumental Bridge][Verse 4]
Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door
[Chorus]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, (Ooh, sweet darlin')
Please don't leave me
