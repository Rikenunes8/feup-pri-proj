[Verse 1]
I was dancing with my baby
To that Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened, happened to see
Well, I didn't know I was going to see him
I introduced him to my baby
While, while they kept on playing
That friend stole my sweetheart
Away from me, yes he did
[Verse 2]
I remember, yeah, that night
Of that beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Oh, you know, you'll never know
You'll never know just how much I've lost, oh
I lost my baby, my sweet baby
While, while they kept on playing
That beautiful Tenne- Tennessee Waltz
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
[Verse 3]
I remember, yeah, that night
Of that beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Oh, you know, you know, you know
Just how much I've lost
Oh honey, I lost too much, yeah
I lost my baby, my sweet baby
While, while they kept on playing
That beautiful, wonderful
That marvelous, yeah man, that glorious
That cotton pickin' Tenne-
Tennessee Waltz
[Outro]
I lost my baby
My my my my baby
