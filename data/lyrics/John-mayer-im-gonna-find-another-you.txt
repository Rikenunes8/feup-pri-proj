[Verse 1]
It's really over, you made your stand
You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my 
loneliness
 is through
[Chorus]
I'm going to find another you
[Verse 2]
You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue
[Chorus]
I'm going to find another you
[Bridge]
When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too
[Verse 3]
So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for 
someone new
I'm going to do some things you wouldn't let me do
[Chorus]
Oh
I'm going to find another you
