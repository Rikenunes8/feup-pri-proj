[Verse 1]
Last night you slept, you slept in fits
You smashed your windows bit by bit
You cried out (a bad dream)
Horror pictures, what a scene!
Which way will things go tonight?
Toss and turn or sleep tight?
You can't win, you wonder why
That sleep is one thing you can't buy
[Chorus]
You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
You can't talk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
[Verse 2]
Downed that pill hours ago
And time is passing oh so slow
Watch the clock (you're waiting)
It's five o'clock and the world is waking
That's the way things went tonight
Tossed and turned though you were tight
Exhaustion brings on desperation
Well there's still some consolation
[Chorus]
You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
You can't talk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
[Verse 1]
Last night you slept, you slept in fits
You smashed your windows bit by bit
You cried out (a bad dream)
Horror pictures, what a scene!Which way will things go tonight?
Toss and turn or sleep tight?
You can't win, you wonder why
That sleep is one thing you can't buy
[Chorus]
You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
You can't talk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
[Outro]
Can't walk (I can't)
Can't talk (walk)
Can't sleep (I can't sleep, oh no)
I can't walk (I can't walk)
I can't talk (I can't sleep)
I can't sleep (Oh no no no)
