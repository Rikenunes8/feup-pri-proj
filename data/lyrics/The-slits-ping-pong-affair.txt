I knew you were sitting in your room all alone
I knew I was the only girl for you
You have told me so
But somehow it slipped my mind
Whilst walking home
Whilst you were sulking I could have been raped
In Ladbroke Grove
Well you can have your records back
And take your comics too
I'm going to have some fun tonight
Life's better without you
So I spend an evening
Without getting my face cut
And another evening
Without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So I listen to the radio
Smoke a cigarette
Same old thing, yeah I know
Everybody does it
Six months
Have passed, now try become between us
I never missed you, only sometimes
Dreaming on a bus
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind
That you and I have grown apart
For the first time
Seeing you with other girls
Sometimes bothers me
But I don't want to play those games
They're just not interesting
So I spend an evening
Without getting my face cut
And another evening
Without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So I listen to the radio
Smoke a cigarette
Same old thing, yeah I know
Everybody does itSince yesterday, like I heard your voice behind me
I froze on the spot, did not turn around
In case you'd find me
I think you lied or you can't tell
Tell the truth
You didn't want me, you wanted someone else
Who'd give you proof
But I can't trust the feelings rushing through my head
I'd wait for you to call me nights
And come to me instead
So I spend an evening
Without getting my face cut
And another evening
Without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So listen to the radio
Smoke a cigeratte
Same old thing, yeah you know
Eveybody does it
