[Verse 1]
Who took your love away?
Who made you cry that day?
What kind of fool would steal your heart
Then turn and lie?
Well, I know one thing is true
This I can say to you
'Cause I am the one who's here
To take the pain away
[Pre-Chorus]
You gave all you had and a few cents more
He turned his back and he's walking out the door
But that's alright, it's alright, go on and let him go
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never known
With all my heart, my mind, my body and soul
(My heart, my mind, my body, and my soul)
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you
[Verse 2]
Just let me lay with you
I promise I'll stay with you
'Cause what kind of fool would let
The prize of your love die?
And since he neglected you
Kept on forgetting you
Had your wants, your needs, your desires to fulfill
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to feel guilty now
'Cause this is the place and this is how
I'll help you face the fact that you deserve much more[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never known
With all my heart, my mind, my body and soul
(My heart, my mind, my body, and my soul)
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you
[Bridge]
He never should've left you alone
You need a love in your life
So baby girl, let it go
Said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never known
With all my heart, my mind, my body and soul
(My heart, my mind, my body, and my soul)
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you[Bridge]
(I never should've left you alone)
He never should've left you alone
You need a love in your life
So baby girl, let it go
Said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here
I'm here to show you love
Like you've never known
With all my heart, my mind, my body and soul
(My heart, my mind, my body, and my soul)
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you
[Bridge]
('Cause I)
Darling, let me tell you what I'll do
Ain't no wall that I won't go through
Girl, I'm here to make your world a little easier
I'm the man that you're gonna want pleasing ya
('Cause I'm gonna show you love)
[Chorus]
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
Would cause you to want someone
As much as they want you
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
Like you've never known
With all my heart, my mind, my body and soul
(My heart, my mind, my body, and my soul)
I'm here to show you love
Here to show you love
That you never knew
