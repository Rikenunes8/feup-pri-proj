[Verse 1]
Way back in time, someone said try some
I tried some, now buy some, I bought some, oh oh oh
After a while when I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you
[Chorus]
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Through my life, I've seen gray sky met big fry
Seen them die to get high, oh oh oh
And when it seemed that I would always be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
[Chorus]
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Outro]
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
