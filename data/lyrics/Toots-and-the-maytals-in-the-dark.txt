[Intro]
Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at
[Chorus]
In the dark, there ain't no light
In the dark, (Lord) you cheat and lie
In the dark, you want to fuss and fight
(Hey, hey) In the dark, you will get no light
[Verse 1]
(Listen) People tell me love, love is true
They tell me love, what love can do
You keep on telling me love, endlessly
That's when you try to turn your back on me
[Verse 2]
I'm so lonely, I'm so blue
Good God, I keep on loving no one but you
No matter where you go, no matter where you roam
I know one day soon you'll want to come back home
[Bridge]
Come on, Come on baby
Come back to me, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at
Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at
Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at
