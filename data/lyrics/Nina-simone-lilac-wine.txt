I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
Be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Lilac wine is sweet and heady like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me nearly here?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I goin' crazy, dear?
Lilac Wine, 
I feel I'm ready
 for my love
Feel I'm ready for my love
