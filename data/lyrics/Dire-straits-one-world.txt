[Verse 1]
Can't get no sleeves for my records
Can't get no laces for my shoes
Can't get no fancy notes
On my blue guitar
I canâ€™t get no antidote for blues
Oh yeah, uh
[Verse 2]
Can't find the reasons for your actions
Or I don't much like the reasoning you use
Somehow your motives are impure
Somehow I can't find the cure
Can't get no antidote for blues
Oh yeah, uh
[Bridge]
They say it's mostly vanity
That writes the plays we act
They tell me that's what everybody knows
There's no such thing as sanity
And that's the sanest fact
That's the way the story goes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, uh
[Verse 3]
Can't get no remedy on my TV
It's nothing but the same old news
Where they can't find a way to be
One world in harmony
Can't get no antidote for blues
Oh yeah, uh
[Outro]
Uh, oh yeah, uh
Alright
