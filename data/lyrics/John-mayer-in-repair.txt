[Verse 1]
Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right
[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
[Verse 2]
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me
[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me
[Chorus]
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair[Outro]
I'm never really ready
Oh I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
