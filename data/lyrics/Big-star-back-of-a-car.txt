Sitting in the back of a car
Music so loud can't tell a thing
Thinking 'bout what to say
I can't find the lines
You know I love you a lot
I just don't know, should I not?
Waiting for a brighter day
I can't find a way
I'll go on and on with you
Like to fall and lie with you
I love you, too
Wo wo wo
Baby, I'm too afraid
I just don't know if it's okay
Trying to get away
From everything
Why don't you take me home
It's gone too far inside this car
I know I'll feel a whole lot more
When I get alone
I'll go on and on with you
Like to fall and lie with you
I love you, too
Wo wo wo
Sitting in the back of a car
Music so loud can't tell a thing
Thinking 'bout what to say
I can't find the lines
