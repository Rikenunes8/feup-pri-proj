[Intro]
Yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
How do you retain your cool, babe?
Seems your love breaks all the rules, hey, hey
You may think that I'm a pro
But I can never seem to keep my control
How can you stand to take things so slow? Ooh
[Chorus]
Look at you (Yeah)
You're so smooth (Oh)
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool (Hey, yeah)
Look at you (Hey)
You're so smooth (Oh)
When I'm around you (Hey)
I can't keep my cool (Mmm)
[Verse 2]
I'm so used to getting what I want
When I want it and where I want it
In your field, I'm inexperienced
So inexperienced, oh
Hey, baby, I'm delirious, ooh
[Chorus]
Look at you (Hey)
You're so smooth (Oh, oh, hey)
When I'm around you (Yeah, oh)
I can't keep my cool (Oh-oh)
Look at you (Oh, yeah)
You're so smooth (Oh, you're so smooth)
When I'm around you (Yeah)
I can't keep my cool (Oh, ooh)[Interlude]
Oh, oh
I can't keep myâ€” (Yeah, I can't)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, hey
Hey, oh
Yeah, oh
Oh
[Verse 3]
So just like you, I keep my cool, yeah
(When you're around)
When you're around, I won't be the fool, yeah
You may think that I don't know
But all the things I want are in my control
How can you stand to take so slow?
Hey, hey, hey, ooh
[Chorus]
Look at you
You're so smooth (Hey)
When I'm around you (Oh)
I can't keep my cool (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look at you (Oh, no)
You're so smooth (Oh)
When I'm around you (Hey, hey)
I can't keep my cool
Look at you (Oh)
You're so smooth (Hey)
When I'm around you (Oh)
I can't keep my cool (Oh, hey)
Look at you (Ah, ah)
You're so smooth (Ah, ah)
When I'm around you (Hey)
I can't keep my cool (Oh, baby)
Look at you
You're so smooth (Yeah, oh)
When I'm around you (Oh)
I can't keep my cool (Oh, oh)
Look at you (You're so smooth)
You're so smooth (You're so smooth)
When I'm around you (So smooth, so smooth)
I can't keep my cool (Ooh)
Look at you (Hey)
You're so smooth (Hey, hey)
When I'm around you (Oh)
I can't keep my cool (Hey)
