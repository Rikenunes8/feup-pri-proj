[Verse 1]
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout
[Chorus 1]
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
[Verse 2]
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
[Chorus 2]
Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
[Verse 3]
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry
[Chorus 3]
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
[Outro]
Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday
