[Verse 1]
You're the one that's causing my blues
You're the one I don't want to lose
You're the one that I'd always choose
You're the one that's meant for me
[Verse 2]
You're the one that I'm thinking of
You're the one that I'll always love
You're the one sent from heaven above
You're the one that's meant for me
[Chorus]
Sometimes you make me feel so bad
You make me cry deep in my heart
I feel like an actor in a play
Who doesn't fit the part
[Verse 3]
You're the one and I want you to know
You're the one that thrills me so
You're the one, I can't let you go
You're the one that's meant for me
[Verse 1]
You're the one that's causing my blues
You're the one I don't want to lose
You're the one that I'd always choose
You're the one that's meant for me
[Verse 2]
You're the one that I'm thinking of
You're the one that I'll always love
You're the one sent from heaven above
You're the one that's meant for me
[Chorus]
Sometimes you make me feel so bad
You make me cry deep in my heart
I feel like an actor in a play
Who doesn't fit the part[Verse 3]
You're the one and I want you to know
You're the one that thrills me so
You're the one, I can't let you go
You're the one that's meant for me
