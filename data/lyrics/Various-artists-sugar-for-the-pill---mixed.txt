There's a blizzard of gulls
They're drumming in the wind
Only lovers alive
Running in the dark

Anna rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love was never number one
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Can't abide the sun
This jealousy will break the whole
Cut across the sky
And move a little closer now
Lying in a bed of greed
You know I had the strangest dream

Anna rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love was never number one
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Can't abide the sun
This jealousy will break the whole


Anna rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love was never number one
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Can't abide the sun
This jealousy will break the whole
