Hey, baby, I'm your man
I know I treated you bad, but I'm doin' the best I can
Now's not the time to cash it in
I'm with you, baby, I always been
And I got to tell you, baby, that our love is strong
But I'm the one, the one who did you wrong
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
That's what she said (Don't say you love me, don't say you love mе)
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love mе, that's what she said)

Hey, baby, don't count me out
I still got a lot to give, stick around and find out
I might surprise you with what our love still brings
I'm never quitting you, even if you quit me
No, I got to tell you baby that our love is strong
I'm the one, the one who did you wrong

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
That's what she said (Don't say you love me, don't say you love me)
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me, that's what she said)
That's what she said (Don't say you love me)
