[Verse 1]
I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes
And
I certainly haven't been spreading myself around
I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb
But I'm good at being uncomfortable so
I can't stop changing all the time
[Verse 2]
I noticed that my opponent is always on the go
And
Won't go slow, so 's not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as
They go fast from whence he came
But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so
He can't stop staying exactly the same
[Chorus]
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
, 
I'm an extraordinary machine
[Verse 3]
I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
You deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way and say
I've been getting along for long before you came into the play
[Verse 4]
I am the baby of the family, it happens
So
Everybody cares and 
wears the sheeps' clothes
While they 
chaperone
Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease
Courteous, to try and help
But let me set your mind at ease
[Chorus]
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
, 
I'm an extraordinary machine[Bridge]
Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?
It's very kind
But it's to no avail; and I don't want the bail
I promise you, everything will be just fine
[Chorus]
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
, 
I'm an extraordinary machine
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it
, 
I'm an extraordinary machine
