[Intro]
When I first saw you, 
I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah
[Verse 1]
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
[Pre-Chorus]
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together, still goin' strong
[Chorus]
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
[Pre-Chorus]
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together, still goin' strong
[Chorus]
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one[Interlude]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah
[Chorus]
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life, oh, yeah
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
[Outro]
I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
