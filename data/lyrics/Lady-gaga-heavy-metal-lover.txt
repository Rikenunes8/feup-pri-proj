Heavy metal lover
[Verse 1]
I want your whiskey mouth all over my blonde south
Red wine, cheap perfume, and a filthy pout
[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight bring all your friends, because a group does it better
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
[Verse 2]
Dirty pony, I can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town
[Pre-Chorus]
Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets, drink beer and get into trouble
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover[Bridge]
I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
[Bridge]
Whip me, slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Bud Lite, liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night with St. 
Jame-son
Like a baptism, heavy metal lovers play
Baby, we were born this way
[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
