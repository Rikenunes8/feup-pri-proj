I'm at my borderline
I'm at my borderline
Love you girl, but I just don't know why
I, have to love you so
When I make love to you
When I make love to you
Love is true, but I just don't know why
I, have to love you so
Need you girl, can't say why
Come on over here, love me now
You know you know, you got to know
You're movin around, pushin me past
My borderline, yeah yeah
It's about time
It's about time
Love you girl, but I just don't know
Why I have to love you so
Need you girl, can't you feel
I just got to know, if it's real
Big and strong, hard and fine
But you're movin around, pushin me past
My borderline, yeah yeah
Ooooooooooh, ooooooooooh
I'm at my borderline
I'm at my borderline
I'm at my borderline
