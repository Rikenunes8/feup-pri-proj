[Outro]
The preceding has been put here on tape
To let you all know that I say it to her because I love having her around
Can you dig it? Can you get to that? Even when she's messing around
He likes having her around even when she's messing around
Which is very often, that's what she's doing
The motion of music when she's messing around
