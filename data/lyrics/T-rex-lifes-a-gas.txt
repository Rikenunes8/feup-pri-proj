I could have loved you, Girl, like a planet
I could have chained your heart to a star
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas
I could have built a house on the ocean
I could have placed our love in the sky
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas
I could have turned you into a priestess
I could have burned your fate in the sand
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all, life's a gas
But it really doesn't matter at all
No it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas
I hope it's going to last
