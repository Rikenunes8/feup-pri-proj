[Verse 1]
Tried to trail you last night, baby, trail you in my car
But I was afraid of what I was looking for
And little by little I am losing my love for you
Yeah, little by little I have found out you was untrue
Alright, Keith, come on, now

[Verse 2]
Well I try not to bear a grudge, a girl is going to hitch a ride
Things ain't been the same since my mother died
Yeah, little by little, I am losing my love for you
Yeah, little by little I have found out you was untrue
Let's get outta here now
