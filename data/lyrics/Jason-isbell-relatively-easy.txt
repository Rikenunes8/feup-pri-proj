Are you having a long day
Everyone you meet rubs you the wrong way
Dirty city streets smell like an ashtray
Morning bells are ringing in your ear
Is your brother on a church kick?
Seems like just a different kind of dope sick
Better off to teach a dog a card trick
Than try to have a point and make it clear
You should know compared
To people on a global scale
Our kind has had it relatively easy
And here with you there's always
Something to look forward to
My angry heart beats relatively easy
I 
lost a good friend
Christmas time when folks go off the deep end
His woman took the kids and he took
 
Klonopin
Enough to kill a man of twice his size
Not for me to understand
Remember him when he was still a proud man?
A vandal's smile, a baseball in his right hand
Nothing but the blue sky in his eye
Still, compared to those
A stone's throw away from you
Our lives have both been relatively easy
Take a year and make a break
There ain't that much at stake
The answers could be relatively easy
Watch that lucky man walk to work again
He may not have a friend left in the world
See him walking home again to sleep alone
Or step into a shop to buy a postcard for a girlI broke the law, boys
Shooting out the windows of my loft, boys
When they picked me up I made a big noise
Everything to blame except my mind
I should say I 
keep your picture
 with me everyday
The evenings, now, are relatively easy
Here with you there's always
Something to look forward to
My lonely heart beats relatively easy
My lonely heart beats relatively easy
