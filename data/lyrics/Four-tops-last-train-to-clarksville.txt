Whoo, whoo! Whoo, whoo!
Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be there by four-thirty
'cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again
We'll have one more night together
Til the morning brings my train and I must go
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Take that last train...
Take the last train to Clarksville
I'll be waiting at the station
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses
And a bit of conversation, oh
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Take the last train to Clarksville
Now I must hang up the phone
I can't hear you in this
Noisy railroad station
All alone, I'm feeling low
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Hey girl, take the last train!
Bring it on home! Hey girl, hey, bring it on home!
Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be there by four-thirty
'cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming homeTake that last train! Whoo, whoo!
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Hey, take that last train! Bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Girl, bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville. (Take that last train! And just bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville...
