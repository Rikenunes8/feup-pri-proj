Mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm
[Verse 1]
Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
She'd say, "Billy, don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass,"
Grandma's hands
[Verse 2]
Grandma's hands sooth the local unwed mother
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say, "Baby, Grandma understands
That you really loved that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands."
Grandma's Hands
[Verse 3]
Grandma's hands used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands, boy they really came in handy
She'd say, "Mattie, don't you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core,"
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmmmm
