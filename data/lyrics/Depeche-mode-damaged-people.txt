[Chorus]
We're damaged people, drawn together
By subtleties that we are not aware of
Disturbed souls, playing out forever
These games that we once thought we would be scared of
[Verse 1]
When you're in my arms, the world makes sense
There is no pretense and you're crying
When you're by my side there is no defense
I forget to sense I'm dying
[Chorus]
We're damaged people, praying for something
That doesn't come from somewhere deep inside us
Depraved souls, trusting in the one thing
The one thing that this life has not denied us
[Verse 2]
When I feel the warmth of your very soul
I forget I'm cold and crying
When your lips touch mine and I lose control
I forget I'm old and dying
