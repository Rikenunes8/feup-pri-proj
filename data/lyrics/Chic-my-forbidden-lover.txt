My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
I fell in love and I didn't want to do it 'cause I knew
That your love wasn't true
You try to hide that sinister appearance
And the lies, those alibis
You'll give your love to anyone who asks, yes, you do
And I know that it's true
But still I care and I want to see you there
When I need, yes, indeed you are
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
I can't resist that very strong urge to have you, dear
Oh, please come here
Just let me love you any time and any place we dare
We'll just let them stare
You want to love everybody and everything you can
You're the typical man
Yet still and all I'm at your beck and call
When you need, yes, indeed you are
