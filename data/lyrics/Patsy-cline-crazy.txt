[Verse 1]
Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
[Verse 2]
I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new
[Verse 3]
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?
[Chorus]
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
