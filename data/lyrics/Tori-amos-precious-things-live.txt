[Verse 1]
So I ran faster
But you caught me here
Yes, my loyalties turned
Like my ankle
In the seventh grade
Running after Billy
Running after the rain
[Chorus]
These precious things
Let them bleed
Let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break
Their hold on me
[Verse 2]
He said "you're really an ugly girl
But I like the way you play"
And I died
But I thanked him
Can you believe that?
Sick, holding on to his picture
Dressing up every day
I wanna smash the faces
Of those beautiful boys
Those Christian boys
So, you can make me cum
That doesn't make you Jesus
[Chorus]
These precious things
Let them bleed
Let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break
Their hold on me
[Bridge]
I remember, yes
In my peach party dress
No one dared
No one cared to tell me
Where the pretty girls are
Those demigods
With their nine-inch nails
And little fascist panties
Tucked inside the heart
Of every nice girl[Chorus]
These precious things
Let them bleed now
Let them wash away
These precious things
Let them bleed
Let them wash away
These...
Let them bleed, now
Let them wash away
These, these precious things
Let them break
Their hold on me
[Outro]
Precious, precious
