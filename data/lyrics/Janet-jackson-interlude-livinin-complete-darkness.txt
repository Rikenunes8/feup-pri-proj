Livin' in a world we didn't make
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules
Livin' in a world we didn't make
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes
How much of this madness can we take as children?
Livin' in a world we didn't make
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules
Livin' in a world we didn't make
In complete darkness, we are all the same
It is only our knowledge and wisdom that separates us
Don't let your eyes deceive you
