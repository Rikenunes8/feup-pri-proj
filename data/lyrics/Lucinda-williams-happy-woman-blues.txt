[Verse 1]
Tryin' hard to be a happy woman
But sometimes life just overcomes me
Everyday I'm workin' just to pay my dues
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused
[Verse 2]
Goin' down south with the New York City blues
Gotta hit the road before I blow a fuse
I might buy me a Cadillac or a Chevrolet
I don't care what model, as long as it takes me away
[Verse 3]
I've been hiding my heart in a trunk
Can you come see me when my ship has sunk?
You can give me lovin' that I can't refuse
And love is the one thing that's sure to cure my blues
[Verse 4]
Goin' down the road with a heavy heart
Tryin' to find lightness in the dark
Tryin' to live my life, tryin' to get satisfied
My mind is in the city, but my heart is in the countryside
[Verse 1]
Tryin' hard to be a happy woman
But sometimes life just overcomes me
Everyday I'm workin' just to pay my dues
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused[Refrain]
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused
