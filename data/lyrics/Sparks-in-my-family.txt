[Verse 1]
That's how it's gonna be
In my family
From the biggest branch to the smallest leaf
Still you're gonna see similarity
[Chorus]
In my family
That's how it's gonna be
[Verse 2]
That's how it's gonna be
'Cause it's my family
Gonna live to see post-senility
Lots of time to spend with my family
[Chorus]
In my family
That's how it's gonna be
[Verse 3]
There you got your Rockefeller
There you got your Edward Teller
J. Paul Getty is a splendid fellow, but
None of them would be in my family
[Chorus]
In my family
That's how it's gonna be
[Bridge]
Family
It's like any other family
Big and small
It's like any other family
[Verse 4]
That's how it's gonna be
Before and after me
Manufacturing many, many me's
Gonna hang myself from my family tree[Chorus]
In my family
That's how it's gonna be
In my family
[Outro]
Family, family
Family, family
