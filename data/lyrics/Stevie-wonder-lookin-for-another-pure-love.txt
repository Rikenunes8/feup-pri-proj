[Verse 1]
Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind
I had no problems, never a problem in my life
Never a worry on my mind
All my days before today were happy
And secure until your phone call
You were telling me goodbye
[Chorus]
Now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
And I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
Do it, Jeff
[Guitar solo: Jeff Beck]
[Verse 2]
Now the wheel of fate has turned
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered
He is a problem in my life
I have a problem on my mind
Things you cherish most in your life
Can be taken if they're left neglected
Leaving a problem in your life
[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
And now I'm looking for another love
And now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
