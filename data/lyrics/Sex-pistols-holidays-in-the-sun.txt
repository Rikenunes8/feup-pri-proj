[Intro]
A cheap holiday in other people's misery
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to the new Belsen
I wanna see some history
'Cause now I got a reasonable economy
[Chorus]
Oh, now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason, now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall
[Verse 2]
In 
Sensurround
 sound in 
a two-inch wall
I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine and I got World War III
I'm looking over the wall and they're looking at me
[Chorus]
Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason, now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall[Verse 3]
They're staring all night and they're staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
And now I got a reason, it's no real reason
And I'm waiting at Berlin Wall
[Bridge]
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all
I'm gonna go over and over the Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Claustrophobia, there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets, oh, when will we fall?
And now I got a reason, it's no real reason to be waiting
At Berlin Wall
[Outro]
I gotta go over the wall
I don't understand this bit at all
This third rate B-movie show
Cheap dialogue, cheap essential scenery
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
Before they come over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
Before they come over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all
Please don't be waiting for me
