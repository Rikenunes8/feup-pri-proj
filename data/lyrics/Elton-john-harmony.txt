[Verse 1]
Hello, baby, hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know?
[Chorus 1]
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony
[Verse 2]
Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!
[Chorus 2]
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony
[Outro]
Never leaving harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Ah-ah!
