Oh, please, don't you think, babe, that I have been wrong to cry, yeah?
You loved me too, so how come you just sit there and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh?
Things just can't be this way, not for very long
No no no, no no, no no no no no no no no no
Our love affair, yes, it's just history, yes it is
And I tried to love you in my own way, I think that you know I did
But to have you here to see you living, oh, so near to me, yeah, hey, hey, hey
Oh, but you are distant and so it's dead
And so often people are glad to be old 'cause yeah
Our love affair is just history, yes it is
Once in a green time a flower
Oh, fell in love with the sun
Their passion lasted for an hour
And then she wilted from her loved one
Once in a green time a flower
Oh, fell in love with the sun
Their passion lasted for an hour
And then she wilted, wilted from her loved one!
And I see you looking up at the sky, how high it is
You wonder if there is, oh, another me, now how can that be, honey, how can it be?
Well, I sit here and I ask you, why all this? I just got toni-ni-ni-night
Our love affair is just history
Well, it's all over, baby, it's over, baby
I can't stand another lo-lo-lonely, I'm never too lonely
It's over baby, I can't help it 'cause I just cry inside, I just cry inside
Oh baby, oh baby, don't you feel me moving?
Oh baby, oh baby, don't you hear me crying?
Well, I don't, I don't have to, yeah
I said now I hurt you, hurt me too now
Oh baby, oh baby ...
