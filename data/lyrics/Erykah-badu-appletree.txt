[Intro]
I'd like to dedicate this to all of the Creator's righteous children
I have some food in my bag for you
Not that edible food, the food you eat?
No. I have some food for thought
Since knowledge is infinite
It has infinitely fell on me, so um...
[Verse 1]
It was a stormy night
You know, the kind where the lightning strikes
And I was hanging out with some of my artsy friends
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh
The night was long, the night went on
People cooling out until the break of dawn
Incense was burning so I'm feeling right, aight
[Pre-Chorus]
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me cause I can't please you
And that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee, doo wee, doo wee
[Chorus]
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You just don't want to be down
[Verse 2]
I have a hoe
And I take it everywhere I go
Cause I'm plantin' seeds so I reaps what I sow (ya know) ya know
Oh, on and on, and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
I can't control the soul flowing in me
(Ooh wee) ooh wee[Pre-Chorus]
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me cause I can't please you
And that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee, doo wee, doo wee
[Chorus]
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You just don't want to be down
Oh my my my
Oh my my my
Oh my my my, ah
Oh my my my my my my my, oh, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me cause I can't please you
And that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee, doo wee, doo wee[Chorus]
And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Dum dum diddy
And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You just don't want to be down, don't wanna be down
[Outro]
You just don't want to be down
Oh, you just don't want to be down
Down, down, down
You just don't want to be down, oh
You just don't want to be down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
You just don't wanna be down
