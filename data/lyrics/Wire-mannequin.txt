[Verse 1]
Well, you're a waste of space
No natural grace
You're so bloody thin
You don't even begin
[Chorus 1]
To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
You just don't interest me
[Verse 2]
Well, you're an energy void
A black hole to avoid
No style, no heart
You don't even start
[Chorus 1]
To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
You just don't interest me
Oh, come on
[Bridge]
You're a disgrace!
[Chorus 2]
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la[Outro]
Last time, now
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
