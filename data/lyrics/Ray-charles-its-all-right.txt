(It's alright)
Woh now, let me tell you now
(It's alright)
So many times I sat down and cried
(It's alright)
You know there's no one to dry my weepin' eyes
(It's alright)
Baby, I'm so in love with you now
(It's alright)
And yet you broke my heart in two
Although you've gone away
There's nothin' I can say but it's alright
(It's alright)
Baby how could you be so mean?
(It's alright)
You know sometimes, I feel like I wanna scream
(It's alright)
Every time I hear someone call your name now
(It's alright)
You know it almost drives me insane
(It's alright)
You took my love and gone
And you know that we're wrong but it's alright
(It's alright)
I want you to keep on saying sure and
(It's alright)
You know someday you'll need these arms of mine
(It's alright)
I said it may take a long, long time
(It's alright)
And when things ain't what they used to be now
(It's alright)
You can bring your fine self home to meTo prove my love is true
I'll hug and kiss you too
And I'll, I'll say, "It's alright"
(It's alright)
