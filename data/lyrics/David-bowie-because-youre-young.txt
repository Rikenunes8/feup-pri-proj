[Verse 1]
Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy
Don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
She can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?
[Pre-Chorus]
It's love back to front and no sides
 (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (hope I'm wrong but I know)
[Chorus]
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars
[Verse 2]
He punishes hard
Was loving her such a crime?
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive
[Pre-Chorus]
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (hope I'm wrong but I know)
[Chorus]
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it'll make me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars[Outro]
A million dreams
A million scars
A million
