Biff, you're on the drums and Dennis, you on the bass
When I count this off, you all give me a little Texas Playboy-type rhythm, okay?
One, two, three four
Gather round friends, why hurry?
Let's all stay a little longer
[Verse 1]
You ought to see my blue-eyed Sally
She live way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate, the number on the door
The next house over is the grocery store
[Chorus]
Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer
Georgie French on the piano
Good morning Joe
[Verse 2]
Can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
The big creek's up and the little creek's level
I plow my corn with a double shovel
[Chorus]
Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer
That's tiny Roy
Hey
[Verse 3]
Sitting, in the window singing to my love
Slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and a grasshopper eating ice cream
The mule got sick so they laid him on the green[Chorus]
Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer
[Verse 4]
Grab your gal and pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
Girls on Cripple Creek about half-grown
They jump on a man like a dog on a bone
[Chorus]
Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer
[Chorus]
Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer
