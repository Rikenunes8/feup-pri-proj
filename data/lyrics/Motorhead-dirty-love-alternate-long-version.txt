[Verse 1]
Gotta taste that dirty love
Don't you waste that dirty love
That's what I need
To satisfy my greed
Gotta taste that dirty love
[Verse 2]
Gotta choose that dirty love
Gotta use that dirty love
That's what I need
To satisfy my greed
Gotta taste that dirty love
Don't you see?
[Verse 3]
Gotta make that dirty love
You can't take that dirty love
That's what I want
Show you this all night long
Gotta make that dirty love
Don't you see?
