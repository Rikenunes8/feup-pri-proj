[Verse 1]
I'm tired of this dirty old city
Entirely too much work and never enough play
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks
Think I'll walk off my steady job today
[Chorus]
Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Been working every day since I was twenty
Haven't got a thing to show for anything I've done
There's folks who never work and they've got plenty
Think it's time some guys like me had some fun
So
[Chorus]
Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free
[Outro]
Hey, Big City, turn me loose and set me free
