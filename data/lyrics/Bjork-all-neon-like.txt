[Verse 1]
Not 'til you halo all over me
I'll come over
Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
I'll be yours
[Verse 2]
I weave for you
The marvellous web
Glow in the dark threads
All neon like
[Verse 3]
The cocoon surrounds you
Embraces all
So you can sleep
Foetus-style
[Chorus]
And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam - it feeds you!
[Verse 4]
The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish, nourish
Your turtleheart
[Chorus]
And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam - it feeds you!
[Interlude]
Don't get angry with yourself
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you[Verse 5]
With a razor blade
I'll cut a slit open
And the luminous beam
Heals you honey, heals you
[Outro]
Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you
I'll heal you
Luminous
I'll heal you
