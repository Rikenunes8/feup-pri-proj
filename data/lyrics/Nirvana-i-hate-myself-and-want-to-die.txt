[Verse 1]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill
[Chorus]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
[Verse 2]
Broken heart and broken bones
Finger plaster cast and horse pills
One more quirky clich√© phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
[Chorus]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
[Bridge]
Words are broken lives. 
Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer
[Chorus]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?[Verse 3]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill
[Chorus]
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
End it someday
What's that sound?
