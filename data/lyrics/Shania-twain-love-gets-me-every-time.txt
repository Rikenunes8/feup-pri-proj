[Intro]
Oww!
[Verse 1]
Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry
Had no worries
Staying single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered
'Til I discovered
[Pre-Chorus]
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it
[Chorus]
Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Or the sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
I guess I, gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it
[Verse 2]
I was quite content
Just a-paying my own rent
It was my place
I needed my space
I was free to shop around
In no rush to settle down
I had it covered
'Til I discovered
[Pre-Chorus]
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it[Chorus]
Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Or the sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
I guess I, gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it
[Bridge]
Ah, ow
Ooh!
Hmmm, mmmm
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it
[Chorus]
Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Ooh, oooh, or his sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
[Bridge]
It's in the way he calls my name (Gone and done it)
And I know I'll never be the same (Gone and done it)
Don't cha know that...[Pre-Chorus]
Love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it
[Outro]
Woo
Thought I had it covered, uh-huh
Life was going great
Well, I gol' darn gone and done it
