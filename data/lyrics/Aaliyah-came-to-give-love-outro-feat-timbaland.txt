Baby girl, you got the whole world screamin'
Giving it up for you, you got the party people fiendin'
Bump it to the roof from the left side to the right side
And straight to the back
Ain't nothin' going on here, but a dirty money track
Got the party people waving their hands and doin' the rodeo
Aaliyah, why don't you kick it, kick the flow

I came to spread my love
To the fans across the world
Reach out to you
Touch the hearts of boys and girls
I came to spread my love
To the fans across the world
Reach out to you
Touch the hearts of boys and girls
I came to spread my love
To the fans across the world
Reach out to you
Touch the hearts of boys and girls
I came to spread my love
