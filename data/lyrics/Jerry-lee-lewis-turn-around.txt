When you're all alone and blue
And the world looks down on you
Turn around, I'll be following you
When you think that love is past
And you'd like to relive the past
Turn around, I'll be following you
Turn around, I'll be walking behind you
With a love that's real and never dies
When you think that love has gone
And you'd like it to linger on
Turn around, I'll be following you
