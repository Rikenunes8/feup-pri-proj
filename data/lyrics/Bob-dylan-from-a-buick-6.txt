[Verse 1]
I got this graveyard woman, you know
She keeps my kids
But my soulful mama, you know
She keeps me hid
She’s a junkyard angel, and she
Always gives me bread
[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed
[Verse 2]
Well, when the pipeline gets broken
And I'm lost on the river bridge
I’m all cracked up on the highway
And in the water’s edge
Here again she comes, down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with a thread
[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed
[Verse 3]
Well, she don’t make me nervous
She don’t talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she don’t need no crutch
She keeps this 
.410
All loaded with lead
[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed
[Bridge]
Come on![Verse 4]
Well, you know I
Need a steam shovel, mama, to
Keep away the dead
I need a dump truck, baby, to
Unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said
[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed
