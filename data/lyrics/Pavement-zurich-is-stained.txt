[Verse 1]
I can't sing it strong enough
Cause that kind of strength I just don't have
If you watch the light change
Don't hold them hanging
[Chorus]
You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I am not one-half of the problem
Zürich is stained, and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run
Sha la la, la la la la, la la la la, la
[Verse 2]
So what does it mean, a mistake or two
If it's the kind of mistakes no one can trace
To the fountain where we sold it
And held them hanging?
[Chorus]
You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I am not one-half of the problem
Zürich is stained, and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run
You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I am not one-half of the problem
Zürich is stained, and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run
Sha la la, la la la la, la la la la, la
