[Pre-Chorus]
She took my hand
And tried to make me understand
That she would always be there
[Chorus]
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today
I'm such a lonely man
[Verse 1]
It came as no surprise to me
That she'd leave me in misery
It seemed like only yesterday
She made a vow that she would never walk away
[Pre-Chorus]
She took my hand
And tried to make me understand
That she would always be there
[Chorus]
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today
I'm such a lonely man[Verse 2]
And if it seemed a sin
To love another man's woman, baby
I guess I'll keep on sinning
Loving her, Lord, till my very last day
[Chorus]
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today
I'm such a lonely man
