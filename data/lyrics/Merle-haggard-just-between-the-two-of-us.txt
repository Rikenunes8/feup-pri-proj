Just between the two of us, we know our love is gone
People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word, no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me, you trust me anywhere
But the reason, if they only knew, is that we just don't care
Just between the two of us, let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us, we know our love is gone
Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot, but even then, I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love, no anything, there's nothing left at all
Just between the two of us, let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us, we know our love is gone
