[Verse 1]
That is all I want to say
Our love could save the day
That is all I'm waiting for
To try to love you more
[Verse 2]
That is all I want to do
To get right next to you
That is all I'm living for
Your love and nothing more
And that is all
[Bridge]
Times I find it hard to say
With useless words getting in my way
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been said before
[Verse 3]
That is all I want from you
A smile when I feel blue
That is all I'm waiting for
Your love and nothing more
And that is all
[Bridge]
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been said before
[Verse 4]
But that is all I want to do
To give my love to you
That is all I'm living for
Please let me love you more
And that is all
