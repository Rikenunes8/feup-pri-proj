[Intro]
Ooh, woo!
Yeah!
[Chorus 1]
Hey baby, you're on a subliminal trip to nowhere
You better get your trip together
Before you step in here with us!
Full moon tonight, everything's all right
Baby, come on back to Wolfman Jack
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
[Verse 1]
If you want yourself a day man, well I don't mind
You just ditch him when the sun goes down
'Cause the moon shines bright and everything's all right
When the Wolfman, he creeps into town
[Chorus 2]
Now you'll maybe want a man
Who throws 'round his money
But he ain't as cool as Wolfman Jack
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
You might want yourself a man
Who don't act so funny
But he ain't your fool like Wolfman Jack
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
[Verse 2]
I don't mean to treat you evil
I'm just a good boy gone bad
But if I catch you after dark walking through the park
I'm just liable to do something mad
[Chorus 3]
You maybe think you know
What love is about, girl
But it's nothing 'til it's Wolfman Jack
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
And everybody knows
You go 'round and shout it
Your only thrill is Wolfman Jack, woo!
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)[Bridge 1]
Full moon tonight, everything's all right
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
I may miss your loving while I'm on my back
But you can't escape from Wolfman Jack
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
You can't do this to me
[Chorus 4]
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
No, no, woo!
[Bridge 2]
Look me in the eyes, baby, now you cut that jive
You know the Wolfman's just about the number one cat alive
You've got my great big eyes spinning 'round in my head
(How could you love another man instead?)
You can't do this to me
[Chorus 5]
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
I may miss your loving while I'm on my back
But you can't escape from Wolfman Jack, no, no
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)[Chorus 6/Outro]
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
Can't escape from Jack, no, no
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)
This lady's Wolfman Jack's, oh, no, yeah, no, oh
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
(Baby, come back to Wolfman Jack)...
