Working on the edge
Losing my self-respect
For a man who presides over me
The principles of his creed
Punch in, punch out
Eight hours, five days
Sweat, pain and agony
On Friday I'll get paid
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
Hey mister don't look down on me
For what I believe
I got my bills and the rent
I should pitch a tent
But our land isn't free
So I'll work my youth away
In the place of a machine
I refuse to be a slave
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
