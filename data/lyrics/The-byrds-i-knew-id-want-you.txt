[Verse 1:]
I'd like to love you, with all of my heart
You've had me on your trip, right from the start
And when you looked at me, with love in your eyes
[Chorus:]
I knew I'd want you, oh yeah
[Verse 2:]
I'd like to hold you, if you want me to
I've found something new, just by looking at you
And it's in your smile, and it's in the way
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
I meet so many people, I feel I don't know
But I felt so close to you, when you said hello
I'd like to love you, and together we'd find
The place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mind
There we'll be happy, and there I'll know why
[Chorus]
