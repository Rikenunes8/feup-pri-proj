[Chorus]
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick. [x4]
[Verse 1]
People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
Come and tell me you love me
She didn't wanna be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag
[Chorus]
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that 
licking stick.
 [x2]
[Verse 2]
People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
Come and tell me you love me
She didn't wanna be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag
[Chorus]
Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick. [x4]
