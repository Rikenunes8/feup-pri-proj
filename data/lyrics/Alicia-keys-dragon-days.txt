[Verse 1]
Like a damsel in distress
I'm stressin' you
My castle became a dungeon
'Cause I'm longing for you (Longin' for you, babe)
Feeling strong for you
You're my knight in shining armor
See your face in a silver moon
All over the lagoon
And it feels like...
[Chorus]
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot, yeah
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
And the daily drag on, and on
[Verse 2]
Desperate for you, baby
Do you know what that means?
I feel like an addict must feel
When he fiends
In an act of desperation
I get lost in my dreams
'Cause like a lady in waitin', I'm waitin' for you
Like a prisoner tied over alligator waters
Waiting for my prince of paradise to come and
Take me away from these... (Tock, tick)
[Chorus]
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot (So bad, baby)
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you, yeah, yeah
And the daily drag on, and on
Don't you wanna play[Bridge]
D.R.A.G.O.N days
Got me D.R.A.G.G.I.N
'Cause I want you, babe
And I need you, baby, oh
[Chorus]
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot (I need you a lot, I need you so bad)
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you, yeah
And the daily drag on, and on
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot (I need you a lot, I need you so bad)
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
And the daily drag on, and on, drag on
