[Verse 1]
Sky fits heaven, so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother, so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see
[Verse 2]
Fate fits karma, so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue, so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be
[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start
[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go
[Verse 3]
Hand fits giving, so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living, so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be
[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go
