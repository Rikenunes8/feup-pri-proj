[Verse 1]
An open road where I can breathe
Where the lowest low is calling to me
I can pull myself back up, back down
Stuck together like a ready-made
And nobody knows where we been
Cancelled rations are running thin
Watches tick out of tune
Falling apart like a 
ready-made
[Chorus]
And my bags are waiting in the next life
[Verse 2]
Rubbish piles fresh and plain
Empty boxes in a pawn shop brain
License plates stowaway
Standing in line like a ready-made
[Chorus]
And my bags are waiting in the next life
[Verse 3]
An open road where I can breathe
Where the lowest low is calling to me
I can pull myself back up, back down
Stuck together like a ready-made
[Chorus]
And my bags are waiting in the next life
