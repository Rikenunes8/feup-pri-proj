[Verse 1]
Pariah from society
Addicted to sobriety
A product of a virgin birth
Another god on earth
Yes that's your fantasy
[Verse 2]
You say that you can read my mind
Be careful of what you might find
You think that you can be like me
And see what my eyes see
But you're no friend of mine
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you believe every word I say?
Make your own truth and get out of my way
[Chorus]
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
[Verse 3]
An angel or the Antichrist
A symbol of your own device
Pathetic in your own sad way
You're just one pill away
From taking my advice
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you believe every word I say?
Make up your mind and get out of my way
[Chorus]
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah[Bridge]
Do you believe that I'm from Heaven?
That I descended from the sky?
The graven image of a pseudo icon
To worship me on high?
I'm not your savior
I got no wings to fly
Just your pariah
Don't look to me when your life is over
[Chorus]
I'm your pariah
For your desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
[Outro]
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
