[Intro]
Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Oh, yeah
Oh
[Verse 1]
Positively never goin' back
I won't live where things are so out of whack
No more rollin' with the punches
No more usin' or abusin'
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather die standin'
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more
[Chorus]
Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Black eyes, all behind me
Blue tears will never find me now
[Verse 2]
Definitely found my self esteem
Finally I'm forever free to dream
No more crying in the corner
No excuses, no more bruises
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather die standin'
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more
[Chorus]
Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Black eyes, all behind me
Blue tears will never find me now[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather die standin'
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more
[Chorus]
Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Black eyes, all behind me
Blue tears will never find me now
[Outro]
Oh, never find me now
It's all behind me, they'll never find me now
Find your self-esteem and be forever free to dream
