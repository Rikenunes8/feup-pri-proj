You can see straight through me
Never thought you'd do me
The way you do
How can anyone be so cruel
When you know I love you, yes I do
Misunderstood
Turned your back on me and left me lonely
I wish I could
Open up my heart so you can know me
How can we make love when you don't love me?
You don't show no love (ah-ah)
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no
You don't show no love (ah-ah)
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no
You have me calling out your name
What is this strange thing inside me
How can anyone be such a fool
When you know you love me, yes you do, yes you do
When I first met you
I could hardly see
But now I'm blind, for real (baby)
I wish you knew how to rescue me
(Da-de-ya-dup-dub-dub-day)
From this misery
How can we make love when you don't love me?
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no
Tell me
How can we make love when you don't love me?
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no[Bridge]
You make me feel like you care a lot
But I love you too much, much too much
You make me feel like you care a lot
But I love you too much, much too much
You make me feel like you care a lot
But I love you too much, much too much
Baby you
