[Verse 1]
I watch you sleep, you look so peaceful
You look so vulnerable, I feel scared for you
[Pre-Chorus]
To me, you're precious, may you always
[Chorus]
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
[Verse 2]
I watch you dance, you look so happy
Lost in the moment of abandon, you're set free
[Pre-Chorus]
To me, you're precious, may you always
[Chorus]
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shineâ€”
