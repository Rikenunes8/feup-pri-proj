[Verse 1]
How young are you? How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eye
How smart are you? How dumb am I?
Don't count any of my advice
[Chorus]
Oh, meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I might dare
[Verse 2]
Call me on Thursday, if you will
Or call me on Wednesday, better still
Ain't lost yet, so I gotta be the winner
Fingernails and cigarettes, a lousy dinner
How young are you?
Oh, oh, oh
Come on!
[Chorus]
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
[Verse 3]
How young are you? How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eyes
How smart are you? How smart are you!?
How dumb am I?
(How dumb am I?)
[Chorus]
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
