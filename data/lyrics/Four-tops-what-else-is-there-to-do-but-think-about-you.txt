Oh you heard this before
And my punchline is poor, here's a funny twist. (Here's a funny twist...)
I don't go out and roam
I prefer to be at home, at a time like this. (At a time like this...)
Since you walked out that door
I don't care anymore, girl I barely exist
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (Oh no!)
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
People say not to worry
You'll be home in a hurry, to comfort me. (Just to comfort me...)
But it's not my composure
It's the sudden exposure, that's worrying me
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (You lovely thing you!)
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
You can check my willpower
At this very hour, girl I think you'd find it was pretty low
I just sit here and brood
And I really don't mean to be rude, but the truth? Girl I think you'll find it so..
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (Oh oh ohhhh...)
So you think I should date
And not anticipate, your sweet return. (Sweet return...)
But I must follow my mind
And pretend to be blind, where you're concerned
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (Don't wanna talk to neighbors or hear from friends...)
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (Ain't gonna answer my phone, wanna be left alone...)
