Quiet now, still of night
Inside fire burning bright
Right moment, laying down
Oh, still no sound
It's all automatic
No thought, automatic
Golden hair, skin glisten
Beating heart but don't listen
Angles sharp, crash together
Time and consciousness sever
Mind in automatic
Time stop, automatic
Quiet now, still of night
Inside fire burning bright (quiet now)
Right moment, laying down (still of night)
Oh, still no sound
It's all automatic
Time stop, automatic
