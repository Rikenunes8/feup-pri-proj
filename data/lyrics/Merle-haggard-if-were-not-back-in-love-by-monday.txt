[Verse]
We can call Mrs. Johnson to keep the kids a day or two
Take the early flight to Florida just the way we used to do
Have room service bring us breakfast, make love all through the day
If we're not back in love by Monday, we can go our separate ways
[Chorus]
If we're not back in love by Monday, we can't say we didn't try
But before we bury our love, let's make sure we've let it die
Sleep a few more nights together, say the things we used to say
If we're not back in love by Monday, we can go our separate ways
[Verse]
We could find that little caf√© with the funny-sounding name
Get the table by the window, I'll say "I love you" once again
If the violin player's still there, we'll dance until the break of day
If we're not back in love by Monday, we can go our separate ways
[Chorus]
If we're not back in love by Monday, we can't say we didn't try
But before we bury our love, let's make sure we've let it die
Sleep a few more nights together, say the things we used to say
If we're not back in love by Monday, we can go our separate ways
