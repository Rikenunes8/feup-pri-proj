[Verse 1]
Well I have been standing here and trembling
I don't know which a way to go
Well I have been standing here and trembling
I don't know which a way to go
Well you know that little girl I been loving
She put me out in the ice and snow
[Verse 2]
Well I have been standing here and trembling
I have you down in my knees
Well I have been standing here and trembling
I have you down in my knees
You know I am going to tell my little baby
Take me back if you please
[Verse 3]
I am still standing here and trembling
I haven't got no where to go
I am still standing here and trembling
I got my whole heart in my hand
You know if I ever get lucky
I will show a woman how to treat a man
