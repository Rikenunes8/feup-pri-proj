[Intro]
Our love was
[Verse 1]
Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly
[Chorus]
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning
[Verse  2]
Flying, soaring
Shining morning
Never leaving
Lying, dying
[Bridge]
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
Love, love, love long
[Chorus]
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning
[Verse 2]
Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly[Chorus]
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning
