[Verse 1]
I caught you knockin' at my 
cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, 
the damage done
[Verse 2]
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done
[Verse 3]
I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out
[Verse 4]
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun
