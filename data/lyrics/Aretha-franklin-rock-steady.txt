[Verse 1]
Rock steady, baby
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is
Step and move your hips with a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
And while you're moving rock steady
Rock steady, baby
[Chorus]
Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is, what it is, what it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling (What it is)
In my hips from left to right (What it is)
What it is is I might be doing (What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh (Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh (Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh (What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)
[Post-Chorus]
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby
[Verse 2]
Step and move your hips with a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
While you're moving rock steady
Rock steady
[Chorus]
Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is, what it is, what it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling (What it is)
In my hips from left to right (What it is)
What it is is I might be doing (What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh (Wave your hands up in the air)
(Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh (What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)
[Post-Chorus]
Rock steady, baby
Rock steady, woo
Rock steady[Bridge]
Rock steady
Rock steady
[Chorus]
(What it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling (What it is)
In my hips from left to right (What it is)
What it is is I might be doing (What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh (Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh (Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh (What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)
[Outro]
Rock steady
Steady, baby
Rock
Rock steady, baby
Baby
(What it is)
Baby, baby
(What it is)
Baby
(What it is)
Baby
