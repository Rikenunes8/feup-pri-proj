[Spoken Intro]
-Erykah, we've known each other for a while, I'm into you
I don't know what I gotta do, you know, to get closer to you
-Wait a minute, you know I'm in a situation
Why are you? Don't do this, why you trippin' like that?
-Well I understand that, but you, your whole vibe is, you know
I can see myself being with you forever
-Wow, that is really, that's really beautiful
I kinda dig you too, you know that
W-we, but we're friends and I'm in a situation
I-I'm in a relationship and you know what that means
-Well whatever I gotta do I'll do it for you
-You sure put me in an awkward situation
[Chorus]
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
[Verse 1]
First time that I saw you boy
It was a warm and sunny day
All I know is I wanted you
I really hoped you looked my way
When you smiled at me, so warm and sweet
I could not stay
You make me feel like a lil bitty girl
What do you do to me?
[Chorus]
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?I guess I'll see you next lifetime
No hard feelings
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gonna be there
[Verse 2]
Your energy feels so damn good to me
It picks me up don't wanna come down
You got me spinning all around
You need to know
I've got somebody
You're beautiful
But still, it ain't that type of party now
[Chorus]
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
(Well I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
Maybe we'll be butterflies
(I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
That sounds so divine(I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
I guess I will now
(I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
Wait, wait a little while
[Verse 3]
See, it ain't nothing wrong with dreaming
Boy, don't get me wrong
'Cause every time I see you
It lets me know just how strong (every single time)
That my love is for my baby
But emotions just don't lie
Well I know I'm a lotta woman
But not enough to divide the pie
[Chorus]
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
(I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
You know I want to stay around
(I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
I'm so confused now
[Chorus]
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
(I guess I'll see you next lifetime)
Already, I'm going to be there
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
(I'm going to look for you)
[Chorus]
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl?
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Oh, oh baby
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there
