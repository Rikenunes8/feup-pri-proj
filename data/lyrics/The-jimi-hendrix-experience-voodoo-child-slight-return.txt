[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah
[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 2]
I want to say one more last thing
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days, hahah
I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days, oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I'll meet you in the next one
And don't be late
Don't be late
[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
[Outro]
I'm a voodoo child, baby
I don't take no for an answer
Question no
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
