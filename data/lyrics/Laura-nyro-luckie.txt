[Intro]
Yes, I'm ready, so come on, Luckie
[Verse 1]
Well, there's an avenue of Devil who believe in stone
You can meet the captain at the dead-end zone
What Devil doesn't know is that Devil can't stay
Doesn't know he's seen his day
Oh, Luckie's taking over and his clover shows
Devil can't get out of hand cause Luckie's taking over
And what Luckie says goes
[Chorus]
Dig them potatoes if you've never dug your girl before
Poor little Devil
He's a backseat man to Luckie forever more
[Intro Reprise]
Yes, I'm ready, so come on, Luckie, Luckie huh
Inside of me, inside of my mind, inside of my mind
Don't go falling for Naughty
Don't go falling for
[Verse 2]
Naughty, he's a dragon with a double bite
Sure can do his shortchanging out of sight
An artist of a sort but a little bit short of luck, this lucky night
Oh, Luckie's taking over and his clover shows
Naughty can't get out of hand cause Luckie's taking over
And what Luckie says goes
[Chorus]
Dig them potatoes if you've never dug your girl before
Oh that poor little Naughty
He's a backseat man to Luckie forever
A backseat man to Luckie, hey, hey, hey
It's a real good day to go get Luckie, go get Luckie[Outro]
I'm gonna go get Luckie
I'm gonna go get Luckie
I'm gonna go get, I'm gonna go get
I'm gonna go get Luckie
You got to go get him, don't let him get away
You got to go get him, don't let him get away
You got to go get him, don't let him get away
Yeah, from you, yeah yeah, from you
Yes, heavenly
Yes I'm ready, yes I'm ready, ready for Luckie
