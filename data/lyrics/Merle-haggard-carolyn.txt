[Verse]
Carolyn, let me tell you what I heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city bright in the nighttime like day
There, they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb dripped with honey
And something about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm and not alone
[Chorus]
Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home
[Chorus]
Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home
