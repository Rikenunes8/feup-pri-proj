[Verse 1]
I remember you so clearly
The first one through the door
I return to find you 
drifting
Too far from the shore
[Verse 2]
I remember feeling this way
You can lose it without knowing
You wake up and you don't notice
Which way the wind is blowing
[Chorus]
So don't fade
No, don't fade on me
[Verse 3]
You were the one who made things different
You were the one who took me in
You were the one thing I could count on
Above all, you were my friend
[Chorus]
So don't fade
Don't fade on me
[Verse 4]
Well, your clothes hang on a wire
And the sun is overhead
But today you are too weary
To even leave your bed
[Verse 5]
Was it love that took you under?
Or did you know too much?
Was it something you could picture
But never could quite touch?[Chorus]
Don't fade
No, don't fade on me
[Chorus]
So don't fade
Don't fade on me
