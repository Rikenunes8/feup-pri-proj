Who'll take the salt from the mines?
Who'll take the dirt from the earth?
Who'll take the leaf and grow it to a tree?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Who'll work the fields with his hands?
Who'll put his back to the plow?
Who'll take the mountain and give it to the sea?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Don't look now, someone's done your starving
Don't look now, someone's done your praying
Who'll make the shoes for your feet?
Who'll make the clothes that you wear?
Who'll take the promise that you don't gotta keep?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Who'll take the promise that you don't gotta keep?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
