You know your love for me
Has given me a thrill
And I just can't stand still
Pretty baby, you know I love you so
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know
You know your kiss kiss kiss
Has set me off my feet
And that just can't be beat
Pretty baby, with any other girl
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know
Every night in my dreams
I can hold you near
Even then I still feel
That loving you is real
You know my love's still strong
And I'm still holdin' on
Ain't nothing we can't do
Pretty mama, you know I love you so
Because I love you and I want you,baby
I got to let you know
Uhm, so good...
Every night in my dreams
I can hold you near
Even then I still feel
That loving you is real
You know my love's still strong
And I'm still holding on
Ain't nothing we can't do
Pretty mama, you know I love you so
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know
