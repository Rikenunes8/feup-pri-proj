[Verse 1]
Sitting in my bedroom late last night
Got into bed and turned out the light
Decided to call my baby on the telephone
All I got was an engaged tone
It's off the hook
[Chorus]
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
[Verse 2]
Talking so long she upset my mind
Why is she talking such a long time?
Maybe she is sleeping, maybe she is ill
Phone is disconnected, unpaid bill
It's off the hook
[Chorus]
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
[Verse 3]
Don't want to see her, afraid of what I'd find
Tired of letting her upset me all the time
Back into bed, started reading my books
Take my phone right off of the hook
It's off the hook
[Chorus]
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook[Outro]
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
