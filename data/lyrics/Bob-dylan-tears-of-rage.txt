We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer no?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
It was all pointed out the way to go and scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand
Now I want you to know that while you were watched, discovered that there was no one true
That I myself really thought
It was just a childish thing to do
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
All that false instruction which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse
Oh, but what kind of love is this which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
