It is a cold winter
Away is the songbird
And gone is her traveller
She waits at home
The sun is on holiday
No leaves on the trees
The animals sleep
While cold north wind blows
The snowflakes are falling
The roof a white blanket
There's ice on the windowpane
She waits alone
She sits by the fireside
The room is so warm
Her children are sleeping
She waits in their home
Passing the time
Passing the time
Everything fine
Passing the time, having the wine
Passing the time, drinking red wine
Passing the time, everything's fine
Passing the time, drinking red wine
Passing the time, everything's fine
Passing the time, drinking red wine
Passing the time, everything's fine
Passing the time, wine and time rhyme
Passing the time
It is a long winter
Away is the songbird
She waits for her traveller
So far from home
She sits by the fireside
The room is so warm
There's ice on the window
She's lonely alone
