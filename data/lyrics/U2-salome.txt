[Verse 1]
Baby please
Baby please don't go
I got lies to feed
They want skin and seed
Now don't make me crawl
Please
Baby don't bite your lip
Give you half what I got
If you untie the knot
It's a promise
[Chorus]
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
[Verse 2]
Baby please
Baby what's that tune
Well I heard it before
When I crawled from your door
And my blood turned blue
Please
Baby please slow down
Baby I feel sick
Don't make me stick to my promise
[Chorus]
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé[Verse 3]
Baby please
Baby don't say no
Won't you dance for me
Under the cherry tree
Won't you swing down low
Please
Baby, please say yes
Baby don't go away
You're spilling me
And your precious love
[Chorus]
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Salomé
