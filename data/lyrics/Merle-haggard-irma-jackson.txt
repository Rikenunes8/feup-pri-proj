[Verse 1]
I'd love to shout my feelings from a mountain high
And tell the world I love her and I will till I die
There's no way the world will understand that love is colorblind
That's why Irma Jackson can't be mine
[Verse 2]
I remember when no one cared about us being friends
We were only children and it really didn't matter then
But we grew up too quickly in a world that draws a line
Where they say Irma Jackson can't be mine
[Chorus]
If my loving Irma Jackson is a sin
Then I don't understand this crazy world we're living in
There's a mighty wall between us standing high
But I'll love Irma Jackson till I die
[Verse 3]
She tells me she's decided that she'll go away
And I guess it's right that she alone should have the final say
But in spite of her decision forcing us to say goodbye
I'll still love Irma Jackson till I die
[Chorus]
If my loving Irma Jackson is a sin
Then I don't understand this crazy world we're living in
It's a mighty wall between us standing high
But I'll love Irma Jackson till I die
