[Verse 1]
"Take good care of what you've got"
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company
[Verse 2]
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
"Won't you keep me company?"
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Oh, marry me for evermore
We'll be good company
[Bridge]
Now marriage is an institution, sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door
[Verse 3]
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company[Ukelele Solo]
[Chorus]
I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company
[Bridge]
All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me
[Verse 4]
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company
