All around the water tanks
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He says, "If you've got money
I'll see that you don't walk"
I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show
"Get off, get off, you railroad bum!"
And he slammed that boxcar door
He put me off in Texas
The place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above
Nobody seemed to want me
Or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixieland
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waiting for a train
Nobody seemed to want me
Or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixieland
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waiting for a train
