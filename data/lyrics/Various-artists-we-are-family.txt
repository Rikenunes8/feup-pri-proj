[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
[Verse 1]
Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(And) And we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
(All) All of the people around us they say, hey
Can they be that close, yeah, yeah
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose
[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
[Verse 2]
Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
(High) High hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
No, we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh no
This is our family jewel
[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing[Hook]
Come on, come on, come on
[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
