[Chorus]
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
[Verse 1]
You and me on the hood of my car
Saturday night, watching the stars
You and me on the hood of my car
Saturday night, watching the stars
You and I, shining lights are what we are
Look at the sky and I am never far
[Pre-Chorus]
I can be right there next to you
No matter where in the world you are
I got you right here next to me
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are
[Chorus]
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
[Verse 2]
The last train's gone, we walk through the night
The moon shines down like a spotlight
The last train's gone, we walk through the night
The moon shines down like a spotlight
You and I, shining lights are what we are
Look at the sky and I am never far
[Pre-Chorus]
I can be right there next to you
No matter where in the world you are
I got you right here next to me
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are[Chorus]
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
It's what we are
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
It's what we are
You and me together, stars forever
Stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
It's what we are
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
It's what we are
[Interlude]
Hey
We're superstars
[Breakdown]
I can be right there next to you
I can be right there next to you
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are
[Chorus]
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
It's what we are
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
We're superstars
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
It's what we are
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
Stars forever
