[Verse 1]
In the morning we arise and
Start the day the same old way
As yesterday the day before and
All in all it's just a day like
All the rest so do your best with
Chewing gum and it is oh so
Repetitious
Waiting on the sun
[Verse 2]
Down on Go-stop Boulevard it
Never fails to bring me down
The sirens and the accidents and
For a laugh there's Plastic Nancy
She's real fancy with her children
They'll go far, she
Buys them toys to
Keep in practice
Waiting on the war
[Verse 3]
I feel shivers in my spine
When the iceman, yes his ice is melting
Won't be there on time
Hope he finds a rhyme
For his little mind
[Verse 4]
I can see you
With no (hands)
(face)
Eyes I need you
You're my (heart)
(face)
Look we're going round and round
