[Verse 1]
When you met me (Oh, oh)
Everything was rosy, ah, ah
If you let me (Oh, oh)
Everything must surely work out fine
When you go (Oh, oh)
Everything that's rosy turns to pieces
You know (Oh, oh)
Everything will go under, believe me
[Chorus]
Where will I run to?
Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side (Do do, do do, do do, do do)
Where will I run to?
What would I do?
I really will, I really can, I really do
I really have a love for you
[Verse 2]
Now, if you get me (Oh, oh)
That could save a thousand conversations
Don't upset me (Oh, oh)
Everything is cosy here tonight
If I move (Oh, oh)
You'd be standing by, it would make a difference
Is it true? (Oh, oh)
Are you coming through, or were you just leaving?
[Chorus]
Where will I run to?
Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side (Do do, do do, do do, do do)
Where will I run to?
Baby, where, where would I hide?
I really will, I really can, I really do
I really have a love for you
Yes, I do (Yes, I do)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, when you met me (Oh, oh)
Everything was rosy
When you let me (Oh, oh)
Everything must surely work out fine (Oh, oh)[Bridge]
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, oh oh, oh oh
Would you ever leave me?
[Chorus]
Yeah, where will I run to?
Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side (Do do, do do, do do, do do)
Where will I run to?
Baby, baby, what can I do?
I really will, I really can, I really do
I really have a love for you
[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
That's right
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I do
I really have a love for you, yeah
Have a love for you, yeah
Have a love for you, yeah
