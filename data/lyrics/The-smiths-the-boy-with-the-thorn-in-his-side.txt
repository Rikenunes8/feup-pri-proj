[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire
For love
[Verse 1]
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever believe me?
Oh, ohh... ohhh... ohhhh
[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire
For l-l-love
[Verse 2]
How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live, how do you start?
Where do you go? Who do you need to know?
Oh, ohh... ohhh... ohohohohoh
[Outro]
Oh...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh...
La lalala la da da...
