[Verse]
Sing me a song of sadness and sing it as blue as I feel
If a tear should appear, it's because she's not here
Sing a sad song and sing it for me
[Verse]
She's unhappy with me, she told me so
I'm unhappy without her and I still love her so
Oh, sing me a song of sadness
Pretend it's the end of the world
[Chorus]
Sing it sweet and sing it low and then I'll have to go
Sing a sad song and sing it for me
[Chorus]
Sing it sweet and sing it low and then I'll have to go
Sing a sad song and sing it for me
