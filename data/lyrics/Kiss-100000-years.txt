[Verse 1]
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while?
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
Well, how could you have waited so long?
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years
[Bridge]
And, baby, won't you let me?
I think I'm going out of my head
I'm just about to, ooh yeah, ha
[Instrument break 1:42-2:26]
[Verse 3]
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while, would you, babe?
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
[Instrumental outro 2:40-3:23]
