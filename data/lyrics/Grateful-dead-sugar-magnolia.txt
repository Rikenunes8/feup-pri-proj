Sugar magnolia
, 
blossoms blooming
Head's all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air
Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia
Ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight, yes, indeed
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
I wander 'roundSunshine daydream
Walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Breathing more freely
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Walking in the sunshine
