How many more years
Have you gonna wreck my life?
How many more years
Have you gonna wreck my life?
Well, the way you done
You gonna wreck my life
How many times
You gonna treat me like you do?
How many more times
You gonna treat me like you do?
You took all of my money and all of my love too
Now I'm old and gray
Got no place to go
Now I'm old and gray
Got no place to go
You got yourself a young stud
And you can't stand me no more
I'm going to the stairs
I'm gonna beg her for my clothes
I'm going to the stairs
I'm gonna beg her for my clothes
For where I go
Nobody knows
