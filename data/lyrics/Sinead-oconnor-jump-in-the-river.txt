[Verse 1]
The phone calls always left me unsure
They'd never say things of their own accord
I am preoccupied
I can't get them out of my mind
They are terrified
[Chorus]
And if you said jump in the river, I would
Because it would probably be a good idea
[Post-Chorus]
You're not supposed to be here at all now
It's all been a gorgeous mistake
Sick one or clean one, the best one
That God ever made
[Verse 2]
When I kissed you, you didn't mind
I thought I tasted of too many cigarettes
But you tasted like wine
And I'm not going to change my mind
Just because of what they said
The worm has laid eggs in their hearts
But not in my head
[Chorus]
And if you said jump in the river, I would
Because it would probably be a good idea
[Post-Chorus]
You're not supposed to be here at all now
It's all been a gorgeous mistake
Sick one or clean one, the best one
That God ever made
[Verse 3]
There's been days like this before you know
And I liked it all
Like the times we did it so hard
There was blood on the wall[Chorus]
And if you said jump in the river, I would
Because it would probably be a good idea
And if you said jump in the river, I would
Because it would probably be a good idea
