Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love for me
Many's the day I've longed for you
To hold you in my arms
Many's the night I've cried for you
And for your many charms
If you'd only come to me my heart wouldn't be full of sorrow
But now all I can do is hope and pray that you will come to me tomorrow
Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love for me
To me you are so beautiful
Beautiful as a song
Whenever I look at you my heart beat like the tom tom
If you'd only come to me
This torch I wouldn't have to carry
And if everything goes right
To the church we'll go to marry
Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love for me
