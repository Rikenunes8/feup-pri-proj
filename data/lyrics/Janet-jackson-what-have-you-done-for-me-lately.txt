[Intro]
"What's up, girl?"
"He stood me up again"
"Again?"
"Mmhmm"
"Well, what's up with this guy?
Do you really like him that much?"
"Yes honey, I love him, he is fun
He does a lot of nice things for me"
I know he used to do nice stuff for you
But what has he done for you lately?
[Verse 1]
Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?
[Refrain]
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dancing 'til I thought I'd lose my breath (Ah)
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death
Ain't that a shame?
[Refrain]
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah[Bridge]
I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this Earth
I'm telling you, no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we can do today
Soap opera says, you've got one life to live
Who's right, who's wrong?
[Refrain]
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Get with it
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately? (This is wild, I swear)
