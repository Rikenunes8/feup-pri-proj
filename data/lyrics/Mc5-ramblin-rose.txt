[Introduction]
Brothers and sisters, I wanna see a sea of hands out there. Let me see a sea of hands.  I want everybody to kick up some noise. I wanna hear some revolution out there brothers.  I wanna hear a little revolution.  Brothers and sisters, the time has come for each and every one of you to decide whether you are going to be the problem or whether you are going to be the solution. That's right. You must choose, brothers, you must choose. It takes five seconds. Five seconds of decision. Five seconds to realize your purpose here on the planet. It takes five seconds to realize that it's time to move, it's time to get down with it. Brothers, it's time to testify, and I want to know, are you ready to testify? Are you ready? I give you a testimonial: the MC5
[Verse 1]
Love is like a Ramblin' Rose
The more you feed it
The more it grows
[Chorus]
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home
[Verse 2]
Ramblin' Rose
Is such a ball
Diamond rings
And a Cadillac car
[Chorus]
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home
[Verse 3]
Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' around
Ramblin' Rose
I'm gonna put you down
[Chorus]
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home
[Verse 1]
Love is like a Ramblin' Rose
The more you feed it
The more it grows
[Chorus]
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home[Outro]
I need a Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
