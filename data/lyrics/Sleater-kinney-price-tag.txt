[Verse 1]
The bells go off
The buzzer coughs
The traffic starts to buzz
The clothes are stiff
The fabrics itch
The fit's a little rough
But I suck it in
To every stitch
Try to fit inside the glove
I scrambled eggs
For little legs
The day's off in a rush
It's 9 AM
We must clock in
The system waits for us
I stock the shelves, I work the rows
The product's all Iight up
If I could flip the switch
The system fix
I could move us to the top
The numbers roll, it's time to go
But never fast enough
[Chorus]
We never really checked, we never checked the price tag
When the cost comes in, it's gonna be high
We love our bargains, we love the prices so low
With the good jobs gone, it's gonna be rough
[Verse 2]
In the market
The kids are starving
They reach for the good stuff
Let's stay off label
Just 'til we're able
To save a little up
The next big  win
The ship comes in
No more worry for us
Just keep moving
The wheels keep turning
It's time to go pay up[Chorus]
We never really checked, we never checked the price tag
When the cost comes in, it's gonna be high
We love our bargains, we love the prices so low
With the good jobs gone, it's gonna be rough
[Bridge]
I was lured by the devil, I was lured by the cost
I was lured by the fear, that all we had was lost
I was blind by the money, I was numb from the greed
I'll take God when I'm ready
I'll choose sin 'till I leave
[Chorus]
We never really checked, we never checked the price tag
When the cost comes in, it's gonna be high
I was lured by the devil, I was lured by the cost (We love our bargains, we love the prices so low)
With the good jobs gone, it's gonna be rough (I was lured by the fear, that all we had was lost)
