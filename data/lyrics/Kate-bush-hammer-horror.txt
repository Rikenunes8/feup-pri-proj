[Verse 1]
You stood in the belltower
But now you're gone
So who knows all the sights
Of Notre Dame?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
They've got the stars for the gallant hearts
I'm the replacement for your part
But all I want to do is forget
You, friend
[Chorus]
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave me alone
The first time in my life
I keep the lights on to ease my soul
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
[Post-Chorus]
I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?
[Verse 2]
Rehearsing in your things
I feel guilty
And retracing all the scenes
Of your big hit
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, God, you needed the leading role
It wasn't me who made you go, though
All I want to do is forget
You, friend
[Chorus]
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave me alone, yeah
The first time in my life
I keep the lights on to ease my soul (Ooh)
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone[Post-Chorus]
I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Who calls me from the other side
Of the street?
And who taps me on the shoulder?
I turn around, but you're gone
[Pre-Chorus 3]
I've got a hunch that you're following
To get your own back on me
All I want to do is forget
You, friend
[Chorus]
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave me alone, uhn uh
First time in my life
I keep the lights on to ease my soul
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone[Post-Chorus]
I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?
