You should'a treated me right
You wouldn't have to cry
And if you loved me a little
You wouldn't have to sigh
'Cause all I wanted, baby, was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel you were mine all mine
Before you started cheating
You were sweet and kind
Starting playing around
Wouldn't pay me no mind
But all I wanted, baby, was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel you were mine all mine
Now that I've found me someone else
You say you still want me and that you still care
I don't believe that you've changed
If I tried you again, it would be the same
You should'a treated me right
You wouldn't have to cry
And if you loved me a little
You wouldn't have to sigh
'Cause all I wanted, baby, was your love sometimes
Just to make me feel you were mine all mine
Now that I've found me someone else
You say you still want me and that you still care
I don't believe that you've changed
If I tried you again, it would be the same
You should'a treated me right
You wouldn't have to cry
And if you loved me a little
You wouldn't have to sigh
'Cause all I wanted, baby, was your love sometime
Just to make me feel that you were mine all mine
Oh why didn't you do it?
You should'a treated me
Oh you should'a treated me right
Oh I want you to tell me, baby
I want you to tell me
Tell me that you care
Oh come on, come on
Treat me right
I want you to hold me and tease me
Oh I want you to squeeze me
Oh come on!
Hold me, baby, tell me that you love me
Come on, tell me that you love me
I wanna hold you
I wanna squeeze you
Come on, come on
Hold me, baby, tease me a little
Now squeeze me
Come on, Daddy, make me feel wonderful
