[Verse 1]
Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed
In six inch heels, quoting magazines
Go all the way, you knew you could
So far, so good
[Verse 2]
Someone asked, "Who do you think you are?
Who pays your bills? How come you came this far?"
Shrugged him off and locked the door
So good, this far
[Chorus]
Now it almost seems impossible
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
[Verse 3]
I don't expect to talk in terms of sense
Our dignity and injured innocence
It contradicts your battle-scars
Still healed, so far
[Chorus]
Now it almost seems incredible
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone
I may be wrong, but I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Now it almost seems impossible
We've found ourselves back where we started from
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here[Interlude]
[Outro]
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
