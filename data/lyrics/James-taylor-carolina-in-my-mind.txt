[Chorus]
In my mind, I'm going to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm going to Carolina in my mind
[Verse 1]
Karen, she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I?
I'm going to Carolina in my mind
[Verse 2]
There ain't no doubt in no one's mind
That love's the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey, baby, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I?
I'm going to Carolina in my mind
[Chorus]
In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind
[Verse 3]
Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway call
Geese in flight
 and 
dogs that bite
The signs that might be omens say I'm going, going
Gone to Carolina in my mind
[Verse 4]
Now where holy host of others standing around me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it looks like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me
If its up and gone to Carolina in my mind[Chorus]
In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind
[Outro]
Gotta make it back home again soon
Gotta get back to Carolina soon
Gotta make it back to my home again soon
Oh no, gotta get back to Carolina soon
Carolina, yeah
Gotta get back home soon
I can't travel no more, baby
Gotta get back home again
Gotta get back to Carolina soon
Gotta get back on home again soon
Gotta get back home
