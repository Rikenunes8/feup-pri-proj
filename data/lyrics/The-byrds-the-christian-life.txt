[Verse 1]
My buddies tell me that I should've waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I still love them, and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life
[Chorus]
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
[Pedal Steel Solo]
[Verse 2]
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
I live without them and walk in the light
I like the Christian life
[Chorus]
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
I like the Christian life
