[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Yes it is)
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well, late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long
[Chorus]
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
[Verse 2]
Early in the morning, at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
'Cause, people, let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline
[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Well, early in the morning
Just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon[Chorus]
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, oh yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Oh, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Whoa
