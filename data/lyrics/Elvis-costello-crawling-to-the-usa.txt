[Verse 1]
I thought I would go to the sea and shrink down very tiny
And slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny
'Til I found there is a way
Of crawling to the U.S.A
[Chorus]
(You had better not go too far)
There's one way out, there's only one way
(Leave your mother and your father)
Crawling to the U.S.A
[Verse 2]
Saw it late one night on a secret channel
(Crawling to the U.S.A.)
It's farther on along the tunnel
(Crawling to the U.S.A.)
It's way beyond the final station
That's the one they never mention
[Chorus]
(You had better not go too far)
There's one way out, there's only one way
(Leave your mother and your father)
Crawling to the U.S.A
[Verse 3]
You don't have to pay them that much
(Crawling to the U.S.A.)
You had better bring your lunch
(Crawling to the U.S.A.)
It's undercover, around the houses
Up your skirt and down your trousers
[Chorus]
(You had better not go too far)
There's one way out, there's only one way
(Leave your mother and your father)
Crawling to the U.S.A[Verse 4]
She said, "I catch you 
taking liberties
, and they do not impress me
Attach me to your credit card, and then you can undress me"
Everybody is on their knees
Except the Russians and the Chinese
[Chorus]
(You had better not go too far)
There's one way out, there's only one way
(Leave your mother and your father)
Crawling to the U.S.A
[Outro]
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S.A
Crawling to the U.S...
