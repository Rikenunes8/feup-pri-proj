[Verse 1]
He takes me to the places you
And I used to go
He tells me over and over
That he loves me so
[Chorus 1]
He gives me love
That I never got from you
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?
[Verse 2]
He never fails to call and tell
Me I'm on his mind
And I'm lucky to have such a guy
I hear it all the time
[Chorus 2]
And he does all the things
That you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?
[Bridge]
He's not the one
Who dominates
My mind and soul
And I should love him so
'Cause he loves me, I know
But his kisses leave me cold
[Verse 3]
He sends me flowers, calls on the hour
Just to prove his love
And my friends say when he's around
I'm all he speaks of[Chorus 2]
And he does all the things
That you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?
