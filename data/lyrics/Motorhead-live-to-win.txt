You know you can't be hurt
You gotta believe in your star
They'll always treat you like dirt
They can only push you so far
They can't take it away
If you've got something to say
They might try and fence you in
But you've only gotta live to win
I know it's hard, a natural drag
It's a hassle to fight
If you don't wanna be a slag
If you believe you're right
They've got the power now
But soon it's our hour now
We all know where we've been
We all been living to win
You mustn't shout it out loud
Don't create a scene
Don't indulge in being proud
It only feeds their scheme
Break down the wall
Live it up, it's their time to fall
Anarchy is coming in
Cause you know we live to win
