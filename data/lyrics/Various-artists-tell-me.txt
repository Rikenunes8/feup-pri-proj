Lyric and beat

Yeah, get up and dance
'Cause the way lyric of your life awaits
There ain't no plans, it's yet to be written
Just take the chance and
Dance to your beat and get away
Only you can make it happen
Oh, let's make it happen
Na-na-na-na
Easy to get discouraged, be damaged
In your mind, those doubts got you tired of runnin' (Runnin')
Holdin' on despite the sadness now
Believe, it's not your fate

Get up and dance
'Cause the way lyric of your life awaits
Thеre ain't no plans, it's yet to be writtеn
Just take the chance and
Dance to your beat and get away
Only you can make it happen
Oh, let's make it happen

Those demons in your head, want it left all unsaid
Don't let it waste your time and just live your life your way
Take a risk and just write a different lyric everyday
Don't need to drive this road on your own, you're not alone

There's no road map to the place you wanna go
(Navigate to the beat of your heart)
There's a million ways to go but no one knows
'Cause your journey's yours
Get up and dance
'Cause the way lyric of your life awaits
There ain't no plans, it's yet to be written
Just take the chance and
Dance to your beat and get away
Only you can make it happen
Oh, let's make it happen

Those demons in your head, want it left all unsaid
Don't let it waste your time and just live your life your way
Take a risk and just write a different lyric everyday
Don't need to drive this road on your own, you're not alone

Just call my name
Got your back when you fall
'Cause I'll be there
Don't be afraid when you're alone
'Cause we'll be victors
Yeah, that's who we are
We're like this shining stars, oh

'Di ka nag-iisa (Ayy)
Dito sa werpa, lahat tayo'y kapamilya
Mula noon, hanggang ngayon, anumang oras
'Yan ika'y makakaasa (Oh)
Kahit saan, kahit kailan, sabay-sabay tayong lalaban
Sa dami ng ating pinagdaanan
Lahat ng pangarap ay makakamtan (Oh)
Call your friends when you need it (Be there in a minute)
Friends who won't let you down (I will be down with you)
Call your friends when you need it (Be there in a minute)
Friends who won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down
You know, I won't let you down (Oh)
You know, I won't let you down

Get up and dance
'Cause the way lyric of your life awaits
There ain't no plans, it's yet to be written (here ain't no plans, it's yet to be written, oh)
Just take the chance and (Just take the chance)
Dance to your beat and get away
Only you can make it happen
Oh, let's make it happen

Call your friends when you need it
Friends who won't let you down
