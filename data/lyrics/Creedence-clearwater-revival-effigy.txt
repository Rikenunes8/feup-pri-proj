[Verse 1]
Last night
I saw a fire burning on
The palace lawn
O'er the land
The humble subjects watched in mixed
Emotion
[Chorus]
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
[Verse 2]
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The palace door
Silent majority
Weren't keeping quiet
Anymore
[Chorus]
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy[Verse 3]
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The country side
In the morning
Few were left to watch
The ashes die
[Chorus]
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
[Outro]
Why?
Why?
Why?
Effigy
