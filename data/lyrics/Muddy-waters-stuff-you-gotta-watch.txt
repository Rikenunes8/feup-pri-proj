[Verse 1]
You know the girl you love she don't treat you right sometimes[x2]
Well, that's the stuff you got to watch because your girl is a liar
You know, the girl you love stays out all night long[x2]
That's the stuff you got to watch because your girl's treating you Wrong
I need my hat, go get my coat
Uncle Zak found out baby you don't want it anymore
[Chorus]
That's the stuff you got to watch[x2]
That's the stuff you got to watch if you don't want to lose your girl
[Verse 2]
You know the girl's no good but don't you make no change
Oh, the girl's no good but don't you make no change
That's the stuff you got to watch because you're justified all the Same
She spends your dough, she drinks your gin
And if she rode round the corner then she's ready to go again
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
Well, that's the stuff you got to watch if you don't want to lose your Girl
Yeah, that's the stuff you got to watch if you don't want to lose your Girl
Well, that's the stuff you got to watch if you don't want to lose your Girl
