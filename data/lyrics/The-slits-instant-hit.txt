He is a boy
He's very thin
Until tomorrow
Took heroin
Don't like himself very much
'Cause he has set to set to self-destruct
He is
Set to self-destruct
He is
Too good to be true
Enjoy it
Destroy it
He is
Too good to be true
He is
Set to self-destruct (set to self-destruct)
Enjoy it
Destroy it
I could
Hate you anytime
I could
Give you anything
Enjoy it
Destroy it
I forgive you anything
But I could
Hate you anytime
Enjoy it
Destroy itHe is
Set to self-destruct
