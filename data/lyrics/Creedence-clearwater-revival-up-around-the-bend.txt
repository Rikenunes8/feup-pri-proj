[Verse 1]
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind
[Chorus]
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Oooh!
[Verse 2]
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the 
neons turn to wood
[Chorus]
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Oooh!
[Verse 3]
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say
[Chorus]
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!
[Guitar solo]
Oooh!
[Verse 4]
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me[Chorus]
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!
[Outro]
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo, yeah
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, all right
