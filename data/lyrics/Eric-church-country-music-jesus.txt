[Verse 1]
There'll be fire on the mountain
I had a revelation last night
Divine inspiration from the other side
Of what it's going to take to right all this wrong
We need a country music Jesus to come and save us all
We need a second coming worse than bad
Some long-haired hippie prophet preaching from the book of Johnny Cash
A sheep among the wolves there standing tall
We need a country music Jesus to come and save us all
[Chorus]
There'll be fire on the mountain
There'll be revival and banging drums
There'll be screaming and there'll be shouting
When my country music Jesus comes
[Verse 2]
We've had our believers in the past
And they gave us a message that would last
They built our house on a foundation of stone
God send a country music Jesus to come and save us all
[Chorus]
There'll be fire on the mountain
There'll be revival and banging drums
There'll be screaming and there'll be shouting
When my country music Jesus comes
There'll be fire on the mountain
There'll be revival and banging drums
There'll be screaming and there'll be shouting
When my country music Jesus comes
When my country music Jesus comes
