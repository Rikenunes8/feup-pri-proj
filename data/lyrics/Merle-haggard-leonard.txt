[Verse]
When Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old, as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick the guitar
And he came to hang a gold one on the wall
The town in which he lived is not important
But you'll know which town I mean by the time I'm through
He soon became a famous entertainer
But Leonard was a name he never used
He was on his way to having what he wanted
Just about as close as one could be
Hey, once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me
But he laid it all aside to follow Jesus
For years, he chose to let his music go
But preaching wasn't really meant for Leonard
But how in the hell was Leonard supposed to know?
Well, life began to twist its way around him
And I wondered how he carried such a load
He came back again to try his luck in music
And lost his wife and family on the road
After that he seemed to bog down even deeper
And I saw what booze and pills could really do
And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober
But I'd forgot about a friend that Leonard knew
Well, Leonard gave me lots of inspiration
He helped teach me how to write a country song
And he even brought around a bag of groceries
Hey, back before Muskogee came along
Really I'm not trying to hide his show name
Or the town in which this episode began
Somehow I had to write a song for old Tommy
If just to see the smiling faces in the bandWell, when Leonard finally came to California
