Yes I believe in fairy tales
And all my favorites come true
The handsome prince rides in
And he sweeps me of my feet
And then it turns out to be you
Baby, I am the romantic kind
But you're the hero in my eyes
I knew when you walked into the room
You were the one, you were the one
You are bringing me the sun and the moon
You were the one, you were the one
Though I don't think that it was just by chance
You must have felt it like I did
It was enchantment with just one glance
A fantasy we both can live
Into the sunset you and me
Just like an old harlequin movie scene
I knew when you walked into the room
You were the one, you were the one
You are bringing me the sun and the moon
You were the one, you were the one
I knew when you walked into the room
You were the one, you were the one
You are bringing me the sun and the moon
You were the one
It was you, yeah
It was you
It was you
I knew when you walked into the room
It was you
You are bringing me the sun and the moon
It was you, yeah, you were the one
You are bringing me the sun and the moon
You are the one, you are the one
I knew when you walked into the room
You were the one, you were the one
You are bringing me the sun and the moon
You were the one, you were the one
