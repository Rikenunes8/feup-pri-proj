[Verse 1]
Oh, it was such a sparkling day
That I should be singing its praises
Just to catch my senses as they slip away
But my sentences and phrases
Are about as worthless as wonder can be
[Verse 2]
And there are words that I could say
Perhaps I lack the sense of occasion
Seems that I’ve been looking down so long you see
That it seemed like up to me
I should be ashamed, I’m sure you will agree
[Pre-Chorus]
So don’t go calling out for Jude or Anthony
Maybe I was lost
I’m a hopeless case
So that every night I listen carefully
But there is no message for me
No message for me
[Chorus]
Sparkling day, sparkling day
Things I never said
Some things you never heard
Sparkling day, sparkling day
Now I wait in vain to see
That there was no message for me
[Verse 3]
I hung beneath the evening star
Long enough to hear my lover whisper
Though the night kept offering a deeper hue
One of every blue persuasion
What in heaven was I to do?
[Pre-Chorus]
So don’t go calling out for Jude or Anthony
Maybe I was lost
I’m a hopeless case
But then every night I listen carefully
But there was no message for me
No message for me[Chorus]
Sparkling day, sparkling day
Things I never said
Some things you never heard
Sparkling day, sparkling day
Now I wait in vain to see
That there was no message for me
[Verse 4]
When love is constant and content
You always fear some lingering temptation
Silhouettes escaping underneath locked doors
I’m astonished and amazed
Perhaps my message was erased
[Pre-Chorus]
So don’t go calling out for Jude or Anthony
Maybe I was lost
I’m a hopeless case
But then every night I listen carefully
But there was no message for me
No message for me
[Chorus]
Sparkling day, sparkling day
Things I never said
Some things you never heard
Sparkling day, sparkling day
Now I wait in vain to see
That there was no message from me
