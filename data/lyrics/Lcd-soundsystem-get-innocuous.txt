[Verse 1: James Murphy]
Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half light
Except today, crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued by the tourists again
When once you had believed it
Now, you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release
[Verse 2: James Murphy]
Alone and prone in the half light
And late, late to your real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes
[Refrain: Nancy Whang]
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
[Outro: Nancy Whang]
Get innocuous
