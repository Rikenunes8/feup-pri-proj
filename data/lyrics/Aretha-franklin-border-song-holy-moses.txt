[Verse 1]
Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed
[Verse 2]
Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction
I think I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Yes, I have
[Bridge]
I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't been abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Yes, I have
[Refrain]
Holy Moses, I have been removed
Holy, Holy
[Verse 3]
Holy Moses, can we live in peace?
Let us try to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man standing over there
What's his color? Do you care? (Holy Moses)
Holy, Holy, Holy Moses, can we live in peace?
[Outro]
Lord, help me now
Holy Moses, can we live in peace?
Holy Moses, can we live?
I wonder can we, can we, can we live in peace?
