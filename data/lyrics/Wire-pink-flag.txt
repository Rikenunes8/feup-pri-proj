I was sold up the river to the red slave trade
The stores were gathered, the plans were laid
Synchronised watches at 18:05
How many dead or alive in 1955?
The pink flag was screaming, bugle boys sucked and blew
No time for confessions, orders given
Books were cooked on the 4th of the 3rd
How many seen or heard on the 12th of the 3rd?
How many dead or alive? (How many?)
How many dead or alive? (How many?)
How many dead or alive? (How many?)
How many dead or alive? (How many? How many?)
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many? How many?
How many!?
How many!? How many!?
How many!? How many!?
How many!? How many!?
How many!?
Yeah!
