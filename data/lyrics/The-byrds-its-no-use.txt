[Chorus 1:]
It's no use saying you're gonna stay
If you don't want to be all mine
I haven't got room for somebody who
Is gonna hurt me all the time
[Chorus 2:]
Somebody who couldn't see
All the love I was trying to give
[Chorus 3:]
It's no use saying you're gonna stay
If you don't want all our love to live
[Verse 1:]
It's no use keeping you around
If you don't want me all the way
There's somebody new who can be found
And I'll find her someday
And she will be everything
All the love she has she'll want to give
[Chorus 3]
[Verse 2:]
Oh I should be good to you but I can't cause before
I was really true to you but you only hurt me more
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3]
