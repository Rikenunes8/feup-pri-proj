[Verse 1]
You know it
You show it
And the time has come to shoot you down
What a sound
When the day is done
And it all works out
[Chorus]
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
[Verse 1]
You know it
You show it
And the time has come to shoot you down
What a sound
When the day is done
And it all works out
[Chorus]
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
[Bridge]
I never wanted
The love that you showed me
It started to choke me
And how I wish I'd said no, too slow
I couldn't take that too fast
I want you to know
[Verse 2]
You know it
You show it
But I can't back down, it's far too late
I can't wait
Now the time has come
And it'll all work out
And when this thing is done
It'll leave no doubt
So when you've had your fun
Will you all walk out?[Outro]
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
