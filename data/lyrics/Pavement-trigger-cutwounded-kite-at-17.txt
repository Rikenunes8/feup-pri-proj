Lies and betrayals
Fruit-covered nails
Electricity and lust
Won't break the door
I've got a heavy coat
It's filled with rocks and sand
And if I lose it

I'll be coming back today (I've got a message for you)
I'll be coming back today (I keep it in my hand)
You know I'm coming back one day (I've got a sister or two)
And I'll be coming back today
Ex-magician
That still knows the tricks
Tricks are everything to me
Until it's free
I've got a trigger cut
And I can't pull it back
But if I learn how

I'll be coming back today (I've got a message for you)
You know I'm coming back today (I keep it in my hand)
You will look at me and say (I've got a sister or two)
That you just wish I went away

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I learned the truth
The truth of the words
Truth I made for you
Because it's just as good
And if I spit it out
Before I chew the ring
I'll rearrange it
'Til it looks just like today (I've got a message for you)
And I'll be comin' back my way (I keep it in my hand)
Then you will look at me and say (I've got a sister or two)
That you just wish I went away
Today

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
