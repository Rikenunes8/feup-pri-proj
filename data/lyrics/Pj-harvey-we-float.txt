[Verse 1]
We wanted to find love
We wanted success
Until nothing was enough
Until my middle name was excess
And somehow I lost touch
When you went out of sight
When you got lost into the city
Got lost into the night
[Verse 2]
I was in need of help
Heading to black out
'Till someone told me, "Run on in, honey
Before somebody blows your goddam' brains out"
You shoplifted as a child
I had a model's smile
You carried all my hopes
Until something broke inside
[Chorus]
But now we float
Take life as it comes
We float
Take life as it comes
[Bridge]
So will we die of shock?
Die without a trial
Die on Good Friday
While holding each other tight
This is kind of about you
This is kind of about me
We just kind of lost our way
But we were looking to be free
[Chorus]
But one day we’ll float
Take life as it comes
We’ll float
Take life as it comes
But one day we’ll float
Take life as it comes
But one day we’ll float
Take life as it comes
But one day
