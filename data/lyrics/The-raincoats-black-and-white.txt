Is it love when I see your face on the rails?
Is it love when I see your face on the rails?
When the black and white landscape
Makes me write this black and white song?
Is it love when I fear you talking to me?
Is it love when I fear you talking to me
And discover it was just a longing
Turned into a black and white song?
Is it love when I don't know who you are?
Is it love when I don't know who you are?
And have to look out of the window
To write this black and white song?
