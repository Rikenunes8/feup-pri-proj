[Intro]
You hate me
Yeah, you hate me!
[Verse 1]
You think I don't see murder in your eye
When you're looking at me
You love me
Yeah, you love me!
You don't wanna be noticeably
Enamored of me
[Verse 2]
So bon voyage, sweet-face
Keep looking for the hole-in-one
Take a look at what you've done
Be a man in a silver trench coat
I'm feeling crazy, can you get me a gun?
Oh...
[Verse 3]
I hate you
I hate you!
You think I don't see your unlimited
Insecurities
I love you
Yeah, I love you
'Cause you know me by what I let you
By what I let you see
[Instrumental]
[Outro]
I love you!
I love you!
'Cause you know me by what I let you
By what I let you see
