[Verse 1]
Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face so soft and wondrous fair
The purest eyes
And the strongest hands
I love the ground on where he stands
I love the ground on where he stands
[Chorus- Nina Simone ]
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair
[Verse 2 - Nina Simone ]
Oh I love my lover
And well he knows
Yes I love the ground on where he goes
And still I hope that the time will come
Still I pray that the time will come
When he and I will be as one
[Chorus- Nina Simone ]
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair
