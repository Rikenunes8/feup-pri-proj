[Verse 1]
Every time I see you
Something happens to me
Like a chain reaction
Between you and me
[Chorus]
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
[Verse 2]
If I didn't love you
I would look around for someone else
But every time I see you
You have the same effect
[Chorus]
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Every time
Every time
[Post-Chorus]
I feel your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Every time I see you
Something happens to me
Like a chain reaction
Between you and me[Chorus]
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Every time
Every time
[Post-Chorus]
I feel your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you
[Outro]
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Every time
Every time
Every time
Every time
Every time
