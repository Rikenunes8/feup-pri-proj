See the old train go down the track
Hear the wheels go clicketty-clack
It's comin' home, comin' home
Leavin' town, baby, ain't comin' home no more
Get the train, you know that's why I'm leavin'
Ain't no use to greavin', well, I guess I'm leavin'
Well, I'm leavin' town' well, I'm leavin' town
Leave town, baby, ain't comin' home no more
Traintime, baby, traintime's almost here
Traintime, baby, traintime's almost here
So give me one more time so now, do-dah-yeah
Traintime, baby
Traintime, baby
Bye-bye, baby
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye, baby
