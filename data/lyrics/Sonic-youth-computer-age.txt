Cars are trucks
Drive by me on the corner
But I'm alright
Standing proud before the signal
When I see the light
I feel like more than just a number
And I stand by you
Or else we just don't see the others
Bikes and vans
Fly by me on on the desert
But I'm alright
Standing out here in the hot sun
When I see the light
I feel like more than just a number
And I stand by you
Or else we just don't see the others
Precious metal lines
Molded into highways
Running
Days and nights
Weeks and months and seasons
Rolling through me
I need you
To let me know that there's a heartbeat
Let it pound and pound
And I'll be flying like a free bird
And you need me
Like ugly needs a mirror
And day by day
This horizon's getting clearer
Computer age
