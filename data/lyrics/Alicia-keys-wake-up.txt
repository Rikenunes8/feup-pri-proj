[Verse 1]
You used to be my closest ally (Uh-huh)
In this cold, cold world of deception and lies, oh
We would defend and protect one another (One another)
Now I can't tell if we're enemies or lovers
[Pre-Chorus]
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves?
[Chorus]
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
[Verse 2]
Oh baby, where did we go wrong, baby? (Uh-huh)
Did this cold, cold world turn us into stone?
Well, now all I battle is your ego and your pride
It's ticking like a time bomb ready to ignite
Hurtin' me to fight
[Pre-Chorus]
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves?
[Chorus]
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
[Bridge]
When the smoke clears
What will be left for us but tears and pain?
Why must we argue over the same things
Just to make up and go back again?
It's never too late, it isn't too long
Can't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong
Gotta get outta bed
And take a look at what's goin' on[Chorus]
Oh, when we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
[Outro]
Oh, baby (Wake up)
Oh, darlin' (Wake up)
When we gonna wake up? (Wake up)
When we gonna take a look and see? (Wake up)
What's goin' on? (Wake up)
Oh, what's goin' on? (Wake up)
'Cause we're wastin' so much time (Wake up)
And we're 'bout to lose it all (Wake up)
Oh, baby, baby, baby (Wake up)
Said, I need you, baby
Oh, I need my baby home
Bring my baby back to me (Wake up)
Oh (Wake up)
Oh, baby (Wake up)
(Wake up)
