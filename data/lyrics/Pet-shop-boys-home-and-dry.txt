[Verse 1]
So my baby's on the road
Doing business, selling loads
Charming everyone there
With the sweetest smile
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh tonight
I miss you
Oh tonight
I wish you
Could be here with me
But I won't see you
'Til you've made it back again
[Chorus]
Home and dry
Home and dry
[Verse 2]
There's a plane at JFK
To fly you back from far away
All those dark and frantic
Transatlantic miles
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh tonight
I miss you
Oh tonight
I wish you
Could be here with me
But I won't see you
'Til you've made it back again
[Chorus]
Home and dry
Home and dry
Home and dry
Home and dry
[Bridge]
Far away
Through night and day
You fly long haul tonight
Come to me
You know I'll be here
When you call tonight[Pre-Chorus]
Oh tonight
I miss you
Oh tonight
I wish you
Could be here with me
But I won't see you
'Til you've made it back again
[Chorus]
Home and dry
Home and dry
Home and dry
Home and dry
[Outro]
Your baby waits tonight
