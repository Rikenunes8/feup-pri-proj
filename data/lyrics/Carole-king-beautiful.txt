[Chorus]
You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel
[Verse 1]
Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
And they don't see it showing, why do I?
[Chorus]
You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel
[Verse 2]
I have often asked myself the reason for the sadness
In a world 
where tears are just a lullaby
If there's any answer, 
maybe love can end the madness
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try
[Chorus]
You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful as you feel
