We can talk about it now
It's that same old riddle, only starts from the middle
I'd fix it but I don't know how
Well, we could try to reason, but you might think it's treason
One voice for all
Echoing (echoing) echoing along the hall
Don't give up on father's clock
We can talk about it now
Come, let me show you how
To keep the wheels turnin' you got to keep the engines churnin'
Well, did ya ever milk a cow? (Milk a cow?)
Well, I had the chance one day but I was all dressed up for Sunday!
Everybody, everywhere:
Do you really care?
Well, then pick up your heads and walk
We can talk about it now
It seems to me we've been holding something
Underneath our tongues
I'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back
It would likely burst your lungs
Whoa, stop me, if I should sound kinda
Down in the mouth
But I'd rather be burned in Canada
Than to freeze here in the South!
Pulling that eternal plough
We got to find a sharper blade, or have a new one made
Rest awhile and cool your brow
Don't ya see, there's no need to slave, the whip is in the grave
No salt, no trance
It's safe now (you know it's safe) to take a backward glance
Because the flames have turned to chalk!
We can talk about it now
