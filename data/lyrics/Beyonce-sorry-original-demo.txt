[Chorus]
The big homie better hold up (Hold up)
Big homie better hold up (Hold up)
My whoadies 'bout to roll up (Roll up)
Young whoadies 'bout to stroll up (Stroll up)
They comin' through the back door
The big homie better hold up (Hold up)
Me and my whoadies 'bout to roll up (Roll up)
I see them 
boppers
 in the corner (Corner)
Sneaking out the back door
[Post-Chorus]
We really could be
Living young, wild and free
[Verse 1]
I left a note in the hallway (Hallway)
By the time you read it, I'll be far away (Far away)
I ain't fucking with nobody (Nobody)
Toast to the good life (Good life)
Suicide before you see my tears in my eyes (In my eyes)
Me and my daughter, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life (Good life)
[Chorus]
Big homie better hold up (Hold up)
Me and my whoadies 'bout to roll up (Roll up)
I say my whoadies 'bout to stroll up (Stroll up)
They comin' through the back door
Big homie better hold up (Hold up)
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up (Stroll up)
I see them boppers in the corner (Corner)
Sneaking out the back door
[Post-Chorus]
We really could be
Living young, wild and free[Verse 2]
Hell no, I ain't gon' call you back (Call you back)
Chase me 'round the world just to fall back (Fall back)
Ain't nobody got no time for that
Tryna keep my family right
Swear you're giving me your heart, but I don't care (Don't care)
Better call Becky with the good hair (The good hair)
You only want me when I'm not there
Boy, you better get in line
[Bridge]
Sometimes I regret the day I put this ring on (Get in line)
Looking at my watch he should've been home (Get in line)
He always got them motherfucking excuses (Get in line)
I pray to God you reveal to me what his truth is (Get in line)
[Chorus]
Hey, big homie better grow up (Get in line)
Ask you something then you choke up (Get in line)
Me and my whoadies gonna roll up
Beating down your back door (Get in line)
Big homie better hold up (Get in line)
You've been running game on the wrong one (Get in line)
I'm runnin' so fast for the long run
Runnin' out the back door (Get in line)[Outro]
We truly could have been
Living young, wild and free (Get in line)
We truly could have been
Living young, wild and free
