You better walk it
And talk it less you lose that beat
Better lose yourself mama
And knock yourself right off of your feet
Yeah, if you're moving too fast
Want it to last
You better walk it, talk it
You better walk it as you talk it or you lose that beat
You better walk it
And talk it less you lose that beat
Oh, you better move it mama
And knock yourself right off of your feet
Yeah, if you're moving too fast
Yet you want it to last
You better walk it, talk it
You better walk it as you talk it or you lose that beat
You better walk it
And talk it less you lose that beat
Then move it mama
And knock yourself right off of your feet
Yeah, if you're moving too fast
Won't you want it to last
You better walk it, talk it
You better walk it as you talk it or you lose that beat
