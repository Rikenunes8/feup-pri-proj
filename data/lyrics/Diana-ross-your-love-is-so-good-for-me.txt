Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
Every day
You're on my mind
Wanna be near you all the time
You made my poem rhyme
And my heart began to sing again
The day your eyes met mine
Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
Two hearts just running free
Like a wind song through the trees
Your love does not possess
It just holds me
Where I wanna be
With binds of tenderness
Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
Baby, you know your love is so good
It's good
You know it's good
Like a star up in the sky
Burning brightly
You and I
Time will tell if love survives
For we only have today
And today
Love is alive
Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
It's so good
You know your love is so good
So good for me
It's so goodNo need to say the words
When you touch me
They will be heard
You gave so much to me
And you showed me how
To love the way true love was meant to be
Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
