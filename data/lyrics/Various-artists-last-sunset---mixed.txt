When the sun goes down
Baby you can come around
‘know you had a long day
I can hold you down
When the sun goes down
Baby you can come around
‘know you had a long day
I can... yeah

Hours on the road ‘cuz she living outta town
Up north baby and she want me right now
Baby i’m a star, all these other boys clowns
Bouncing all around ‘cuz you got tied down
I got problems money can’t solve baby
Would you care if I lose it all baby?
Ain’t nobody can be who you are baby
Perfect, you ain’t even gotta try
Whoah oh ho, I’m so sorry for my lies
You make me like I don’t even wanna die
Every day I wake up knowing that you by my side
Losing my life, you found me on the best time

When the sun goes down
Baby you can come around
‘know you had a long day
I can hold you down
When the sun goes down
Baby you can come around
‘know you had a long day
I can... yeah

Don’t wanna say goodbye to you
I was tryna' spend my whole life with you
Baby ain’t nobody coming after you
Perfect, you ain’t even gotta try

Whoah oh ho, i’m so sorry for my lies
You make me like i don’t even wanna die
Every day i wake up knowing that you by my side
Losing my life, you found me on the best time
When the sun goes down
Baby you can come around
‘know you had a long day
I can hold you down
When the sun goes down
Baby you can come around
‘know you had a long day
I can... yeah
