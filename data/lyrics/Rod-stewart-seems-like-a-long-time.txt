[Verse 1]
Nighttime is only the other side of daytime
But if you've ever waited for the sun
You know what it's like to wish daytime would come
[Chorus]
And don't it seem like a long time
Seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time
[Verse 2]
Hard times are only the other side of good times
But if you ever wished hard times were gone
You know what it's like to wish good times would come
[Chorus]
And don't it seem like a long time
Seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time
Help me, seems like a long time
Seems like a long time, seems like a long, long time
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
And don't it seem like a long time
Seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time
And don't it seem like a long time
Seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time
And don't it seems like a long time
Seems like a long time, seems like a long, long time
You know it makes me sad
Seems like a long time, seems like a long time
Seems like a long, long time
[Verse 3]
Wartime is only the other side of peace time
But if you've ever seen how wars are won
You know what it's like to wish peacetime would come
[Outro]
And don't it seem like a long time
Seem like a long time, seems like a long, long time
