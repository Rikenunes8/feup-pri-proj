[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like them rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (
Know
)
[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (
On my radar
)
On my radar (
On my radar
)
And yep, I notice you
I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar (
On my radar
)
On my radar (
On my radar
)
When you walk (
When you walk
)
And when you talk (
When you talk
)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (
That's what I want
)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar  (
On my radar
)
On my radar  (
On my radar
)
[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
[Verse 2]
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handle that animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (
Know
)
[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (
On my radar
)
On my radar (
On my radar
)
And yep, I notice you
I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar (
On my radar
)
On my radar (
On my radar
)
When you walk (
When you walk
)
And when you talk (
When you talk
)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (
That's what I want
)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar  (
On my radar
)
On my radar  (
On my radar
)
[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar[Spoken Interlude]
I got my eye on you
And I can’t let you get away
[Bridge]
Hey baby, whether it's now or later (
I gotcha
)
You can’t shake me (
No
)
'Cause I got you on my radar
And whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
'Cause I got you on my radar (
I gotcha
)
'Cause I got you on my radar
[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (
On my radar
)
On my radar (
On my radar
)
And yep, I notice you

Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar (
