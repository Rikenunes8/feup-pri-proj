[Verse 1]
Hauntings and bellwethers
Not always, but forevers
I'll tell you why, I'll tell you why
I am your spy
I'll tell you
I am your spy, I'll tell you why
Yes, I'll tell you
Yes, I'll tell you
[Chorus]
Swoon
Swoon in spirals phased
Swoon in chorused grays
Won't you go?
Won't you freeze?
Please although
You're asked to still
Swoon in somber haze
Swoon by haste
[Verse 2]
Replays and now downwards
Flailings ain't no westwards
Two eves have I, two eves have I
I am your spy
I'll tell you
Yes, I'll tell you
[Chorus]
Swoon
Swoon in spirals phased
Swoon in chorused grays (Chorused grays)
Won't you go?
Won't you freeze?
Please although
You're asked to swoon
Swoon by dеvilment
[Outro]
(Ooh, ah)
So what's been done
Let it lingеr on
Like candy floss (Ooh)
Or loss unswept
Swoon, swoon
Swoon, swoon (Ooh, ah)
Swoon
