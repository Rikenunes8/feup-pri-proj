I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
Let's make lots of money

You have got the brawn, you got the brains
You want money

You can tell I'm educated
I studied at the Sorbonne
Doctored in mathematics
I could have been a don
I can program a computer
Choose the perfect time
If you've got the inclination
I have got the crime
Oh, there's a lot of opportunities
If you know when to take them
You know, there's a lot of opportunities
If there aren't, you can make them

I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
Let's make lots of money
Let's make lots of...


You can see I'm single-minded
I know what I could be
How'd you feel about it?
Come and take a walk with me
I'm looking for a partner
Regardless of expense
Think about it seriously
You know it makes sense

Let's make
(Got the brains, got the looks)
Let's make lots of money
(Money)
(Let's make)
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
(Ooh)
Let's make lots of money
(Money)
I've got the brains, you've got the looks
(Got the brains, got the looks)
Let's make lots of money
(Ooh money)

Money
"All the love that we had
And the love that we hide
Who will bury us
When we die?"
