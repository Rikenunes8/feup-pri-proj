I got stones in my passway
And all my roads seem dark at night
I got stones in my passway
And all my roads seem dark at night
I have pains in my heart
They have taken my appetite
I have a bird to whistle
I have a bird to sing
Have a bird to whistle
And I have a bird to sing
I have a woman that I'm loving
Boy, but she don't mean a thing
My enemies have betrayed me
Have overtaken poor Bob at last
My enemies have betrayed me
Have overtaken poor Bob at last
And 'eres one thing certainly
They have stones all in my pass
Now you trying to take my life
And all my loving too
You laid a passway for me
Now what are you trying to do
I'm crying please
Please let us be friends
And when you hear me howling in my passway rider
Please open your door and let me in
I've got three legs to truck home
Boys please don't block my road
I've got three legs to truck home
Boys please don't block my road
I've been feeling ashamed about my rider
Babe, I'm booked and I got to go
