[Verse 1]
All these accidents that happen
Follow the dot
Coincidence makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to
[Chorus]
This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
[Verse 2]
All that no one sees
You see what's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts
You heal deep inside of me, ooh
You don't have to speak
I feel
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Confuse
Can the riddle get solved?
And you push me up to
[Chorus]
This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be[Pre-Chorus 1]
Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to
[Chorus]
This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
[Outro]
