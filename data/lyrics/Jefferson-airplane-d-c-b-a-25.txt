It's time you walked away and set me free
I must move away, leave you be
Time's been good to us my friend
Wait and see how it will end
We come and go as we please
(We come and go as we please)
That's how it has to be

Here in crystal chandelier, I'm home
Too many days I've left unstoned
If you don't mind happiness
Purple pleasure-fields in the sun
Ah, don't you know I'm runnin' home
(Don't you know I'm runnin' home)
To a place to you unknown
I take great peace in your sitting there
Searching for myself, I find a place there
I see the people of the world
Where they are and what they could be
I can but dance behind your smile
(I can but dance behind your smile)
You were the world to me for a while
