[Intro]
Whoo!
All right
[Verse 1]
My heater's broke, and I'm so tired
I need some fuel to build a fire
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah, ooh
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out
[Chorus]
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together, ow!
[Verse 2]
It's time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
Heh-heh, the cheapest stuff is all I need
To get me back on my feet again
[Chorus]
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together, ow
[Instrumental break 2:40-3:39]
Whoa yeah!
[Outro]
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together, ow
