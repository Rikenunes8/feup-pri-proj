Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Melting in a pot of thieves wild card up my sleeve
Thick, heart of stone
; 
my sins, my own
They belong to me
Me
People said beware but I don't care
Their words are just rules and regulations to me
Me
I walk in a room you know I look so proud
I move in this here atmosphere where anything's allowed
Then I go to this here party and I just get bored
Until I look out the window see a sweet young thing
Humping on a parking meter leaning on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good
Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to make her mine
Oh I'll put my spell on her
 here she comes
Walking
 down the street here she comes
Coming
 through my door here she comes
Crawling
 up my stair here she comes
Waltzing
 through the hall in a pretty red dress
And oh, she looks so good
Oh, she looks so fine
And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to make her mine
Then I hear this knocking on my door hear this knocking on my door
And I look up to the big tower clock and say oh my God it's midnight
And my baby is walking through the door laying on my couch
She whispers to me and I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good
And oh, she was so fine
And I'm going to tell the world that I just made her mine
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is

G-L-O-R-I-A GloriaI was at the stadium
There were two thousand girls
Called their names out to me Marie 
Ruth
 but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them
I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chiming in my heart going ding-dong
Ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong
Ding-dong
Calling the time when you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh, you were so good
Oh, you were so fine
And I've got to tell the world that I made ya mine, made ya mine
Made her mine made ya mine made her mine made ya mine
