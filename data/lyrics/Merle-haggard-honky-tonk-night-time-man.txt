I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man, I can't stand no light
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man, I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the daytime, I make my running round at night
I had the blues this morning, I had the blues all day today
I had the blues this morning, I had the blues all day today
But when the sun goes down, I'm gonna tuck my blues away away
Then my heart starts beatin' when the sun starts sinking low
Lord, my heart starts beatin' when that sun starts sinking low
When the shadows fall, I know it's time to go
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man, I can't stand no light
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man, I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the daytime, I make my running round at night
