[Verse 1]
Well, your railroad gate
You know I just can't jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I just sitting here, beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Verse 2]
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah, when you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Bridge 1]
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately
[Verse 3]
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright, so where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Bridge 2]
Well, I don't know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
They're just gonna have to wait
[Verse 4]
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Verse 5]
Well, I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie
