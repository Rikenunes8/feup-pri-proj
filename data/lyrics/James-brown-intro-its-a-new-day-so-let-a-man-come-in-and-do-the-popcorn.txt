Girl, let me tell you what you got to do
T.C.B. so mellow, so nobody can get through
When he ask you do you love him, smile and kiss his cheek
Walk away and twist your hip, make sure you keep him weak
Don't let nobody take care o' your business better than you do
Do what he wants, give him what he wants, respect will come to you
And then you can hold your man
You can hold your man
You can hold your man
You can hold, hey!

Never get so confident so it's nothin' you want to know
Because that's the time you lose your thing, and then you got to blow
You know you got what it takes, beaming up to Mars
Use your thing so carefully and don’t be a total loss
Sister, when you love your man, be careful how you tell him that
He will put you back in a corner, and use you like a Sunday hat

Hold your man
Hold your man
Hold your man
Hold... Hey!

C’mon now, hit me!
