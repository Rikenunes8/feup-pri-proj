[Verse 1]
There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
[Verse 2]
When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer
[Chorus]
Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far
[Verse 3]
Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor
To stay together
[Verse 4]
We made our very first promise
To love, to share
And be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right
[Chorus]
Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far[Bridge]
I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
[Verse 5]
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you
[Chorus]
Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
You know you can't rush love
Love
Let's wait awhile (Ooh, ooh)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Wait awhile)
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far (Far, far, oh)
Let's wait awhile (Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Love's so good)
Sure our love will be there
Let's wait awhile (Slow it down)
Before we go too far[Outro]
I promise
I'll be worth the wait
