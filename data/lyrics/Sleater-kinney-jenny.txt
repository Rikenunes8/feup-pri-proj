Do you see her face
When she's gone?
Sometimes so bright
Your heart just stops
Did she answer you
Your other half?
You know they say
She comes just once
I am the girl
I am the ghost
I am the wife
I am the one
Do you wanna forget?
Live in the dark
Was she just too close
To everything?
I am the girl
I am the ghost
I am the wife
Oh, Oh I am the...
Didn't we almost have it almost have it almost have it almost
Didn't we almost have it almost have it almost have it almost....
Didn't you want it?
Didn't you want it?
Didn't you want it?
Didn't you want it?
Didn't you want it?
Didn't you want it?
Do you see her face
When she's gone?
