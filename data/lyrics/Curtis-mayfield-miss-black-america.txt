[Spoken: 
Girl
 and Curtis Mayfield]
Hello, daddy
Hello, baby, how is my love child?
Fine
Tell me of all your dreams
What most do you hope to be when you become a big girl?
Daddy, I would like to be Miss Black America
[Vocal]
Hurryingly stepping so proud
Mother nature's only godchild
Society salutes you today
And we'd like to say
God bless Miss Black America
Watch over Miss Black America
She cried tears of success
We wish her long happiness
Miss Black America
Sisters, we're all so very proud
Of that natural look we see among the crowd
Worldwide admiration
From nation to nation
They love you, Miss Black America
We love you, too, Miss Black America
You're such wonderful people
And so beautifully equal
Miss Black AmericaA culture no one can deny
If a young child should ask
Then tell them why
They should not be ashamed
Of their past, just explain
The true mother is Black America
None other than Miss Black America
She cried tears of success
We wish her long happiness
Miss Black America

We're so proud of you
Miss Black America

We're so proud, so proud
Miss Black America
Miss Black America
