[Verse 1]
I gave my heart and soul to you, boy
Didn't I do it, baby?
Didn't I do it, baby?
I gave you the love that you never ever knew, boy
Didn't I do that, baby?
Didn't I do that, baby?
[Pre-Chorus]
I've cried so many times and that's no lie (I've cried so many times and that's no lie)
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry (It seems to make you laugh each time I cry)
Baby, can you dig it?
[Chorus]
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
And tell me, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
[Verse 2]
I thought that love of yours was true, boy
Didn't I think that, baby?
You know that I thought that, baby
But this time I am really leavin' you, boy
Don't you know that, baby?
I know you know that, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Ten times or more, I've walked out that door (Ten times or more, you walked out the door, yes you did)
But just be sure you get it straight this time, baby, there won't be no more
Baby, can you dig it?
[Chorus]
And didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
Oh, oh, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
[Bridge]
(Didn't I do it to you?) Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I do it to you?) Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I put it on you?) Didn't I do it? Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I do it to you?) Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I do it to you?) Hey, didn't I do it?
(Didn't I put it on you?) Didn't I, didn't I?[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how many times did I walk out that door? (Ten times or more, you walked out the door, yes you did)
(But just be sure you get it straight this time, baby, there won't be no more)
Baby, can you dig it?
Baby, can you dig it?
[Chorus]
Didn't I blow your mind this time, baby, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
Oh, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
[Outro]
Now, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Blow your mind this time, didn't I? (Oh yeah)
Blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Blow your mind this time, didn't I?
