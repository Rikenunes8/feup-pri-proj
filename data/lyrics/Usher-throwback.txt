Real talk, Usher
Just Blaze, you know
Oh, oh ohh
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishin' she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears, right?!
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
[Verse 1: Usher]
You never miss a good thing 'til it leaves ya
And finally, I realize that I need ya
I want you back
Baby girl, I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man, I wish I would've kept my girl
And I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby
[Chorus: Usher]
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
Because I'm missin' my baby (Missin' my baby)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, oh-oh
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
I'm goin' out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said 'em now
[Bridge 1: Usher &

Aww, baby, what you say now?
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
And still, I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you
I need you, babe[Verse 2: Usher &

If I could rewind the time and get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doin', babe (Oh)
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish I could try
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work, (Ah, baby)
[Chorus: Usher]
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
Because I'm missin' my baby (Missin' my baby)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, oh-oh
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
I'm goin' out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said 'em now

Mmm, you're gonna want me back
(Oh-oh) Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it used to be, oh, oh
(You're gonna need me)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work[Chorus: Usher &

It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
Because I'm missin' my baby (I'm missin' my baby, yeah)

I just wish I could find you, girl, oh baby
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
The love of my life
But I wasn't lovin' you right, baby, yeah, yeah

(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishin' she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
Now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizin' she ain't ever coming home
(Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh)
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
