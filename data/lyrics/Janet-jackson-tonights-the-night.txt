[Intro]
This is just between me and you, and you
[Verse 1]
Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax, baby, and draw that blind
Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen up the back of your pretty French gown, yeah
Let me pour ya a good long drink
Ooh, baby, don't you hesitate
[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
[Verse 2]
Come on, angel, my heart's on fire
Don't deny this one desire
You'll be a fool to stop this time
Spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause
[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
[Bridge]
Tonight, tonight's the night
Tonight, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
[Verse 3]
Don't say a word, my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old 'cause[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, boy
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
(This is so special)
[Outro]
Tonight's the night, don't be afraid
You know I'm gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night, don't be afraid
I'm gonna make things alright
Tonight's the night, don't be afraid
You know I'm gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night, don't be afraid
I'm gonna make things alright
Tonight's the night, don't be afraid
(Please, don't leave, I don't wanna be left all alone)
