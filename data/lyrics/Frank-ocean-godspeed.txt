[Verse: Frank Ocean]
I will always love you
How I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still, I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You'll look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always
[Bridge: Frank Ocean & 
Kim Burrell
]
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (
Until it's time
)
This love will keep through blinding of the eyes (
Oh
)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (
Oh
)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (
Oh, it's 'til it's time we die
)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
[Outro: Kim Burrell]
Oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh, oh
