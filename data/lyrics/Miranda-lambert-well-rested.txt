[Verse 1]
Well, this moment is heavy
For me, I'm not ready
Like a caged bird barely set free
Forgive me, I'm finding my wings
[Verse 2]
While my body is present
My heart is absent
And my mind is racing
And my feet are pacing
[Chorus]
It's your tail you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And your heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested
[Verse 3]
My gears are grinding
I'm leaving, you're arriving
It's a matter of timing
I guess loving ain't surviving
[Chorus]
It's your tail that you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And a heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested
[Chorus]
It's your tail that you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And a heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested
[Outro]
Don't waste your investment
If a heart ain't well-rested, ooh-ooh
My heart ain't well-rested
