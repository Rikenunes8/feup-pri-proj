[Verse 1]
I was all alone with the scent of a bone
And my heart was stuck in this emptiness zone
I had not a care, though I wanted to hear
The voice of a maiden who was playing down there
[Chorus]
At the rifle range, I lost my heart
At the rifle range, I could not start
At the rifle range, she left me so hot
At the rifle range
[Verse 2]
Like a victim of truce, I was strung on a noose
Cracking at the news of a prey let loose
I turned around to stare at the face she would wear
And I ran through the gallows, her heart was down there
[Chorus]
At the rifle range, I lost my heart
At the rifle range, I could not start
At the rifle range, I heard a shot
At the rifle range
[Verse 3]
If I lose my head, we'll be certainly dead, oh
With visions of acid, how I wish they bled, oh
The drumming's of fear cause they're getting so near
And I think of a lion who was devoured down there
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
At the rifle range, I lost my heart
At the rifle range, I could not start
At the rifle range, she left me so hot
At the rifle range, I heard a shot
At the rifle range[Outro]
Bang bang, at the rifle range
Bang bang, at the rifle range
Bang bang
