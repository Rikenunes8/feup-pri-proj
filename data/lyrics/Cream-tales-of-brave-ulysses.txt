[Intro]
You thought the leaden winter
Would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer
To the violence of the sun
[Verse 1]
And the colors of the sea
Bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To kiss their white laced lips
[Verse 2]
And you see a girl's brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind[Chorus]
The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter
[Verse 3]
Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
[Chorus]
The tiny purple fishes
Run lauging through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter
