Gonna sing an old song to you right now
One that you heard before
Might be a window to your soul I can open slowly

I’ve been singing this way for so long
Riding through this storm
Might remind me of who we are
And why we walk so lowly

Before the world has closed us in
We might still allow for changes to be made
In a way of times right now and as we grow together


Before your computer turns on you
And walking through the garden
You remember something you've been through
And mingle with the stars in the sky

Stars in the sky
They only know we see them therе
Stars in the sky
That watch us grow and see how we are
(Stars in thе sky)


Clouds on the sun can save your skin
But that's just what you're thinking
Shade is shade and it sucks you in
No matter what you're thinking

Gonna sing an old song to you right now
It's one that you heard before
It might be a window to your soul I can open slowly

So, welcome back, welcome back
It's not the same
The shade is just you blinking
Welcome back, welcome back
It's not the same
Welcome back, welcome back
It's not the same


Welcome back, welcome back
It's not the same
The shade is just you blinking
