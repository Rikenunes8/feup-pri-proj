[Verse 1]
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always gonna be this gray
[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away
[Verse 2]
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always gonna be this gray
[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away
[Bridge]
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way and face another day
[Verse 3]
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always gonna be this gray
[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away
