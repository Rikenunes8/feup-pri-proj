I know your antiseptic
Your deodorant smells nice
I'd like to get to know you
You're deep frozen like the ice

He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away
The S.R. way
You may get to touch her
If your gloves are sterilized
Rinse your mouth with Listerine
Blow disinfectant in her eyes

He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away
The S.R. way

Her phobia is infection
She needs one to survive
It's her built-in protection
Without fear she'd give up and die

He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away
The S.R. way
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away
The S.R. way
