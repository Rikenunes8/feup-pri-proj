[Verse 1]
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time, 
huh
You done me wrong
Just like a train
Let all my friends come over and eat
You were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh, when you were mine
Used to let you wear all of my clothes
You were so fine
Hah, baby, that's the reason that it hurt me so
[Chorus]
I know (
I know
)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (
Don't care
)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
[Verse 2]
When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So, I was blind
I let you fool around
I never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping in between the two of us[Chorus]
I know (
I know
)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (
Don't care
)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
Aah, ha-ha-hey, yeah
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you
[Chorus]
I know (
I know
)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (
Don't care
)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie, oh
I love you more than I did when you were mine
[Outro]
Ooh-oh
I love you more than I did when you were mine
Ooh-oh-uh-oh
I love you more than I did when you were mine
Ooh-oh-uh-oh
I love you more, I love you more when you were mine
Ooh-oh-uh-oh
I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
I love you more when you were mine
