[Verse 1]
This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams are withered and died
[Bridge]
Once I was bending the tops of the trees
Kind words in my ear, kind faces to see
[Verse 2]
Then I struck up with a girl from the west
Played run and hide, played run and hide
Count one to ten and she's gone with the rest
My dreams are withered and died
[Verse 3]
Silver moon sail up and silver moon shine
On the waters so wide, the waters so wide
Steal from the bed of some good friend of mine
Oh my dreams are withered and died
[Bridge]
If I was a butterfly, live for a day
And I could be free just blowing away
[Verse 1]
This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
Oh my dreams are withered and died
My dreams are withered and died
