[Verse 1]
Don't you feel it growin' day by day?
People gettin' ready for the news, oh yeah
Some are happy, some are sad
We got to let the music play
Oh, yes we have
[Verse 2]
I said what the people need
Is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't hard to do if you know how, oh yeah
Gotta get a message, get it on through
A-mama's goin' to after a while, hey, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
(Oh-oh) All the time (Oh, oh)
Shoot me like I never knew, ooh (Woo)
[Verse 3]
Well, I know you know better
In everything you say
Meet me in the country for a day
(Meet me, meet me, come meet me, meet me)
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh, yes, we will
We're gonna dance our blues away
Come on, can you feel it?
[Verse 4]
If I'm feelin' good to you
And you're feelin' good to me
There ain't nothin' to do, nothin' to say, ah, yeah
We're just feeling good, we're just feeling fine
We're gonna let, let the music play, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, listen to the music (Hey, hey)
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
All the time (Oh-oh, oh, ah)
Oh, baby, let the record play, woo[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Everybody, oh-oh, listen to the music (Hey, hey)
Oh-oh, listen to the music
Oh-oh, listen to the music
[Outro]
Come on and listen
Somebody, clap your hands (Listen to the)
If you feel that you want to (To the music)
Stomp your feet (Listen to the)
If you feel that it makes you move (To the music)
It's alright (Listen to the)
If you feel that you wanna shout (To the music)
Come on (Listen to the)
Listen to the music (To the music)
In my hands (Listen to the)
In my soul (To the music)
In my body (Listen to the)
Come on (To the music)
Listen to the music (Listen to the)
Ha, ha (To the music)
Ha, I got to feel it (Listen to the)
Wanna move, yeah (To the music)
Can't stop movin' (Listen to the)
Come on (To the music)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
