Forefather pointed to kingdom come
Sadly told his only son
Just be careful what you do
It all comes back on you
False witness spread the news
Somebody's gonna lose
Either she or me or you
Nothing we can do
So don't you say a word
Or reveal a thing you've learned
Time will tell you well
If you truly, truly fell
Tarred and feathered, yea!
Thistles and thorns
One or the other
He kindly warned
Now you look out the window tell me
What do you see?
I see a golden calf pointing
Back at me
I been sitting in here for so darn long
Waitin' for the end to come along
Holy roaster on the brink
Take a choice, swim or sink
False witness, cast an evil eye
Said I cannot tell a lie
Haints and saints don't bother me
I'm not alone you see
So don't you say a word
Or reveal a thing you've learned
Time will tell you well
If you truly, truly fell
Tarred and feathered, yea!
Thistles and thorns
One or the other
He kindly warnedNow you look out the window tell me
What do you see?
I see a golden calf pointing
Back at me
