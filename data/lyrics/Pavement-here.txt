[Verse 1]
I was dressed for success
But success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs
At your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this
[Pre-Chorus]
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
[Chorus 1]
And all the sterile striking it defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon your forehead where the mist's for hire if it's
Just too clear
Let's spend our last quarter stance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
[Verse 2]
Painted portraits of minions and slaves
Crotch-mavens and one-night plays
And they the only ones who laugh
At the jokes when they are so bad
And the jokes they're always bad
But they're not as bad as this
[Pre-Chorus]
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
[Chorus 2]
And all the Spanish candles they sold away have gone to this
And a run-on piece of mountain travels, shivers, runs, down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
We guess a guess is the best I'll do, I'll do
Last time, last time is the best time I spent
