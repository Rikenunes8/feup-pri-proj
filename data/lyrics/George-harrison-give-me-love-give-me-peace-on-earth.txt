[Verse]
Give me love, give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope, help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you
 with
Heart and soul

Om...
My Lord
Please take hold of my hand
That I might understand you
Won't you please, oh, won't you?
[Verse]
Give me love, give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope, help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to, touch and reach you with
Heart and soul
[Bridge]
Om...
My Lord
Won't you please, oh, won't you?
[Verse]
Give me love, give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope, help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to, touch and reach you with
Heart and soul
Give me love, give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me, keep me free from birth
Now give me hope and help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to, touch and reach you with
Heart and soul[Outro]
