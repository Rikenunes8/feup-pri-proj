[Intro: Stephen Marley]
*Scat*
And she says she needs more than a friend
That's all I ever been, yo
Well one day you gon' overstand (*scat*)
And I remember the first time that we met, yo
How could I forget ya?
When you smiled
And I turned and I said to you
"Yo, you pure and true."
[Hook: Marley]
I'm in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you, yeah
I'm so in love baby
I don't care what your mama say
Standing in love lady
And I don't care what your sister say
(*Scat*)
I need ya
[Badu]
He said he's really diggin me
I don't know what to say
I can't imagine why I feel so weak, say, say
That's when he took my heart in his hands
And kissed it gently
He open up his lips then said this poetry
:
[Hook: Badu]
"I'm in love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you
I'm so in love baby
I don't care what your brothers say, no
I'm so in love baby
I don't care what the people say."[Marley & (Badu)]
Well I try and I try, and I try and I try
(And I try and I try, and I try and I try)
[Marley]
And you said you need more than a friend
That's all I've ever been yo
Well one day you gon' overstand (*Scat*)
[Badu]
And when I look In your eyes
I know that you were meant to be
My solider so baby come on
I mean it desperately
[Hook: Marley & (Badu)]
