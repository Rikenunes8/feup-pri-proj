[Intro]
Oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh-woah-woah-woah
Oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh-woah-woah-woah
[Verse 1]
Sitting here with nothing to do
Sitting here thinking only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Sitting here with nothing to do
Sitting here thinking only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
I don't care, oh-woah
[Chorus]
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
I don't care, oh-woah-woah
[Bridge]
When I saw her on the corner
She told me told me told me told me
She wouldn't go far
Ooh, now I know I'm so much in love
Because she's the only girl that I'm ever thinking of
[Chorus]
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
They chopped her up and I don't care
I don't care, oh-woah-woah[Outro]
Texas chain saw massacre
Texas chain saw massacre
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh yeah
