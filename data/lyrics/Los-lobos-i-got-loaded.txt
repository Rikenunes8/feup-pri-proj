Last night I got loaded
On a bottle of gin, on a bottle of gin
Last night I got loaded
On a Bottle of gin, on a bottle of gin
But I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Night before last I got loaded
On a bottle of whiskey, on a bottle of whiskey
Night before last I got loaded
On a bottle of whiskey, on a bottle of whiskey
But I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright
Tonight I might get loaded
On a bottle of wine, on a bottle of wine
Tonight I might get loaded
On a bottle of wine, on a bottle of wine
Gonna feel alright, gonna feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright
Feel alright
I feel alright
