[Spanish Intro]
Todos necesitamos
Un amigo en la soledad
[Verse 1]
Feeling so alone and deserted
With people standing all around you
Should I trust someone?
Should I stay off to myself?
Alone with no one to talk to
It's such a helpless feeling, so
[Chorus 1]
Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when you're lonely
[Verse 2]
So don't isolate yourself
Every time that I come around
A person all alone is an unhappy one
We need somebody near to love us
Someone who cares
Living life all by yourselves
Impossible to do
And I'll be there for you
[Chorus 2]
Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend
And I'll be yours if you're lonely
[Bridge]
If you're all alone and a friend, you need
Like a river flows, you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'Cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find
If you're lonely, I will be there
When you call for me, be there for you[Chorus]
So anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Everybody needs a friend
To be there when you lonely
[Breakdown]
Don't be shy call on me
When you need a friend, you can call on me
Never let you down, never let you down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
So anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Be there always through the night
If you're all alone and a friend, you need
Be there for you, be there for you, oh baby
If you're all alone and a friend, you need
Like a river flows, you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'Cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find
Una persona solitaria es una persona muy triste
Te quiero tanto
