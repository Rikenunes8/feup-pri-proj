[Verse 1]
Well, I spent my whole lifetime in a world where the sunshine
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round
I squandered emotions on the slightest of notions
And the first easy lovin' I found
[Chorus 1]
But soon all the good times, the gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord, if you hear me, touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away
[Verse 2]
There's times when I trembled when my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show but these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face
[Chorus 2]
Oh Lord, if you're listening, I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine, throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away
[Outro]
Oh Lord, if you hear me, touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away
