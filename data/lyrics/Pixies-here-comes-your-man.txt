[Verse 1: Black Francis]
Outside there's a boxcar waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait till face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the boxcar waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains
[Pre-Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
, 
Black Francis & Kim Deal
]
There is a wait so long (
So long, so long
)
You'll never wait so 
long
[Chorus: Black Francis and Kim Deal]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
[Verse 2: Black Francis]
Big shake on the boxcar moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown
[Pre-Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
, 
Black Francis & Kim Deal
]
There is a wait so long (
So long, so long
)
You'll never wait so 
long
[Chorus: Black Francis and Kim Deal]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
[Bridge: Black Francis]
Ay-yeah
Ay-yeah
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh[Pre-Chorus: Black Francis, 
Kim Deal
]
There is a wait so long (
So long, so long
)
You'll never wait so long
[Chorus: Black Francis and Kim Deal]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
