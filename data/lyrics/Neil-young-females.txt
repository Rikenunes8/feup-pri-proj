You're just a stupid girl
You really got a lot to learn
Start livin' again
Forget about rememberin'
You're such a stupid girl

You're such a beautiful fish
Floppin' on the summer sand
Lookin' for the wave you missed
When another one is close at hand
You're such a stupid girl
You're such a stupid girl
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
Ah
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la

I saw you in Mercedes Benz
Practicing self defense
You got it pretty good I guess
I couldn't see your eyes
You're really stupid, girl
You're such a stupid girl
You're such a stupid girl
