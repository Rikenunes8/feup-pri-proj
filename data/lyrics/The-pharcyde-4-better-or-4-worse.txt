[Intro]
Uhh, do you take, Rhymealinda
Do you love me Tre?
Do you really love me?
To be your lawfully, wedded, wife?
Uhhh, uhhhhh, I do, I do, no I don't, I do
[Verse 1: Slimkid3]
Ah roomie zoom zim, I'm off to be wed
To Rhymealinda I remember umm, when we first met
In '82, back in school, used to play up all the fools
Sometimes you'd be my number five, sometimes you'd be my twenty-two
But umm, screw the dumbshit, 'cause little Rhymea's true
I can't wait to say "I do", and oh yeah honey there's no due
I got my chariot rollin', now I'm mic controlling
Got some spunk in my funk, I can't wait to put some soul in
We're rollin all strikes, we're havin' little tykes
One is little Mike, the other's Ike, I'm sure that you would like
To hold 'em, or maybe stroll 'em on their little bikes
When they're born, I've sworn, to bring 'em up right
You know, dope is how I breed em, 
beats is what I'll feed em
They'll be healthy like a health nut, I'm sure you shake your butt
Kick the verse preacher
, and I won't disperse
Here's my life Rhymealinda for better or for worse
[Chorus]
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t, stop
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t stop
[Verse 2: Imani]
Well it's done, she tagged me, duck duck goose
I'm batter up, I can't sleep, the fly brother must produce
The power pack and I'm stacked like a forty-five mag
Straight up tennis shoes, in my pants there's a sag
Droppin' so much grammar gotta slam it down my mouth
Shup? I met a slut she, put me in the rut G
With the dip that was down with me from the whole front
Now front me never too cool how-ever
I gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Fix it up eat it down throw it in the gutter
(Gutter dreamed it) sour, (creamed it) gotta
Skinny-dipped into her ass as if it was a pool of water
Now the water's gettin hotter so I bought her a new ring
Maybe a love ballad is the song I sing
I gotta kiss her ass my tongue I hold before I curse
If you really want me BITCH, take me for better or for worse[Chorus]
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
(I mean nah, just)
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
[Woman: “I got it!”]
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t stop [“Hello?”]
[Verse 3: Fatlip]
Well this is the final chapters [“Hellooo?”]
Of me, we're going to rack up [“Who is this?"]
In tune, in tune, in tune, a button [""Why are you calling my house, who is this?"]
A button, a button! Oh c'mon, honey ["What?"]
Would you come along with me down the lane ["Mike, is that you?"]
And I will pick your brain ["Oh my God. Who is this?"]
I won't be good like you think I will ["I'll fucking call the cops, don't call my house"]
I'll take a hammer and start to drill ["Oh my God, what is this?"]
Your skull, and then I'll really start pickin'
Your brains out ["What?"] I will be lickin' ["I'm gonna call the cops, okay?”] Mmm mmm mmm mmmm! *slurp* ["Quit fucking around"]
You taste so intelligent, ahhhhhh ["Hello, who is this?"]
Yes yes yes, you trusted me, now ["Help! Who is this? What are you doing? Why are you calling me?"]
I busted thee, top of your skull
You thought the day was going to be DULL??
A little very exciting ["Who are you?! Why are you calling my house?"]
I took your fingers then I started
BITING, and then I scraped the meat ["Stop calling here!"]
Off, the bone, of your leg ["Don't call here anymore"]
Ahhhhh, you tried to make me beg
But I had to insist, I had to insist, I... ["Oh my God...!"]
Run up your pussy with my fist [AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!]
Okay, I think we've gone a little bit ["I'm gonna call the cops!"]
Overboard, don't stop it yet ["Fuck you don't call my house!!][Interlude: Fatlip]
Like this... ("like what like what like what")
Like this... ("like what like what like what")
Like this... ("like what like what like what")
Like this... ("like what like what like what")
