[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)
[Verse 1]
Early in the morning we'll be starting out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our Woody
With our boards inside
And heading out singing our song
[Chorus 2]
Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)
[Verse 2]
At Huntington and Malibu
They're shooting the pier
At Rincon they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming get ready to go
[Chorus 2]
Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)[Verse 3]
They're angling in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Doheny too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild
It's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru
[Chorus 2]
Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)
[Outro]
With me
Surfing Safari
[Repeat until fade]
