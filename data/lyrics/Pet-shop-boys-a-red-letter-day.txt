[Verse 1]
Go to work and take your calls
Hang the fruits of your labour on the walls
Such precision and care
What does it matter if there's no one here to share?
The flowers in the garden, the wine
The 
Waiting for Godot
 and so much 
modern time
?
[Chorus]
All I want is what you want
I'm always waiting for a red letter day
[Verse 2]
The years perfecting a stance
Of measured cool fade into insignificance
The moment one starts to understand
What on Earth does it profit a man?
[Chorus]
All I want is what you want
I'm always waiting for a red letter day
[Post-Chorus]
For something special, somehow new
Someone saying, "I love you"
Baby, I'm waiting for that red letter day
[Bridge]
You can sneer or disappear behind a veneer of self-control
But for all of those who don't fit in
Who follow their instincts and are told they sin
This is a prayer for a different way
[Chorus]
All I want is what you want
I'm always waiting for a red letter day
[Post-Chorus]
Like Christmas morning when you're a kid
Admit you love me and you always did
Baby, I'm hoping for that red letter day today
