[Verse 1]
Well I'm going away to leave
Won't be back no more
Going back down south, child
Don't you want to go?
Woman I'm troubled, I be all worried in mind
Well babe I just can't be satisfied
And I just can't keep from crying
[Verse 2]
Well I feel like snapping
Pistol in your face
I'm going to let some graveyard
Lord be your resting place
Woman I'm troubled, I be all worried in mind
Well babe I can't never be satisfied
And I just can't keep from crying
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
Well now all in my sleep
Hear my doorbell ring
Looking for my baby
I didn't see not a doggone thing
Woman I was troubled, I was all worried in mind
Well honey I could never be satisfied
And I just couldn't keep from crying
[Verse 4]
Well I know my little old baby
She going to jump and shout
That old train be late man, Lord
And I come walking out
I be troubled, I be all worried in mind
Well honey ain't no way in the world for me to be satisfied
And I just can't keep from crying
