[Verse 1]
Way down here, you need a reason to move
Feel a fool, running your stateside games
Lose your load, leave your mind behind, Baby James
[Chorus 1]
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so simple, I just got to go
The sun's so hot I forgot to go home
Guess I'll have to go now
[Verse 2]
Americano got the sleepy eye
But his body's still shaking like a live wire
Sleepy Se√±orita with the eyes on fire
[Chorus 2]
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
The moon's so bright like to light up the night
Make everything all right
[Verse 3]
Baby's hungry and the money's all gone
The folks back home don't wanna talk on the phone
She gets a long letter, sends back a postcard
Times are hard[Chorus 3]
Oh, down in Mexico
I never really been so I don't really know
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go
Oh, Mexico
I never really been but I'd sure like to go
Sing woah, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go now
[Outro]
Talking 'bout in Mexico (Mexico)
In a honky-tonk down in Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
