[Chorus: Run]
You know I'm proud to be Black, y'all
And that's a fact, y'all
And if you try to take what's mine, I'll take it back, y'all
It's like that
[Verse 1: Run]
Licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
Listen, party people, here's a serious song
It's right not wrong, I should say right on
I gotta tell you somethin' that you all should know
It's not a mystery, it's history, and here's how it go
Now Harriet Tubman was born a slave
She was a tiny Black woman, but she was brave
She was livin' to be givin', there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave in this day and age
, I'm proud to be
[Verse 2: D.M.C.]
Black
, goddamn, I'm tired, my man
Don't worry 'bout what color I am
Because I'll show you how ill this man can act
It could never be fiction, 'cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way, I will not turn back
I'm proud of my name, my name is Darryl Mack
I'm Black and I'm proud, and I'll say it out loud
I'll share my story with the whole crowd, uh
[Chorus: Run, 
D.M.C.
, 
Run & D.M.C.
]
You know I'm proud to be Black, y'all
And that's a fact, y'all
And if you 
try
 to take what's 
mine
, I'll take it 
back
, y'all
It's like that
[Verse 3: Run]
DJ Run and I'm running things
You can hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King, I will do my thing
I'll say it in a rap 'cause I do not sing
[Verse 4: D.M.C.]
D.M.C., the man that's causin' the grief
I got a message for the world, so listen up, it's brief
Like Malcolm X said, I won't turn the right cheek
Got the strength to go the length if you wanna start beef, start beef[Chorus: Run, 
D.M.C.
, 
Run & D.M.C.
]
You know I'm proud to be Black, y'all
And real brave, y'all
And motherfucker, I could never be a slave, y'all
So take that
[Verse 5: Run & 
D.M.C.
]
Gonna tell ya somethin', put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
The world's full of hate, discrimination and sin
People judgin' other people by the color of skin
I'll attack this matter in my own way
Man, I ain't no slave, I ain't bailin' no hay
Written a deposition, in any condition
Don't get in my way, 'cause I'm full of ambition
I'm proud to be Black 
and I ain't takin no crap
I'm fresh out the pack 
and I'm proud to be Black
, so take that
[Verse 6: Run-D.M.C.]
There was a man, an inventor, who invented so well
He invented a fortune for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver made the peanut great
Showed any man with a mind could create
You read about Malcolm X in the history text
Jesse Owens broke records,
 Ali broke necks
What's wrong with ya, man? How can you be so dumb?
Like Dr. King said, "We shall overcome"
