Ayy, man
I'm, I'm walkin' on South Beach the other day, right?
You know, the Memorial Day weekend shit thing
Yeah, so they got a nigga come up to me with a video camera, right?
And you know motherfuckers come up to me with cameras every day, so I don't be trippin'
All day, every day, you know what I mean?
So, but guess what this nigga asked me?
"Yo, can I battle you on camera?"
I was like, "Dawg, how much we gon' make for this?"
You, you really think, yo
Yo, for all you niggas thinkin' y'all can see me
And think it's really a game 'cause I'm from the South or I don't really be boastin' and braggin' 'bout that flowin' shit
Dawg, I got this shit, dawg
You niggas think you could fuck with me?
