[Verse 1]
Ayo, let me be blunt, this is real and not a stunt
I'm comin' to the forefront
Shovel for the rebel and clear the lane
'Cause this jam is like a tomahawk, chump
Teach ya, I'll never stop droppin' topics
Vocal power, yes I got it
On central but they're trying to clamp it down
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it down
Get down and at the same time come up, down
This is the crime that shut us up
I don't give a fuck because the words and the thoughts still hit
And like I said, it's not a skit
Jump another hit, yeah
Ya know I don't need a drum kit
Make 'em say, "Aw shit"
The rebellion is true and legit
[Chorus]
Down, get down
And clear the lane
Down, get down
And clear the lane
Down, get down
And clear the lane
Down, get down, yeah[Verse 2]
The rebel, you'll never disable
Defiance, with the cards up on the table
Pulling cards, keep the governments in check
Yo, I think we need a new deck
Never could trust a filibusta'
The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya
With words cold hittin' with the underground
And now you're checkin' out the new sound
Live hit, a live pop
Live rock and ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on
Who's a threat? Come on, the war is on
[Chorus]
Down, get down
And clear the lane
Down, get down
And clear the lane
Down, get down
And clear the lane
Down, get down
And clear the lane
[Verse 3]
Start droppin', our words are never safe
Fighting with [myself 'til I'm where I gotta be] [?]
A challenge, don't sweat it, now don't you forget it
Check me? What? Wait, you better slow down
Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat
I need cash so pinnacle is never ever weak
Places are fluid and diluted and complete
Check me once, calm down, take a seat
Strip the chains, the freedom's there, but then it's gone[Refrain]
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
[Verse 4]
Defiance, rippin' up the sound set
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in
Timmy C, bring that bass in
[Refrain]
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
