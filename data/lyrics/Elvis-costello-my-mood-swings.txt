[Verse 1]
She was smitten from the first
By a curious fellow
She said I love the way you talk
And with a flounce she announces
I love the way that you pronounce it: "Marshmallow"
So she liked to sing along
To her favourite song
From the year that she was born
She had mysterious affairs
And promptly work out what her age is
[Chorus]
So speak to me
Just like you should
And then you can say those wicked things
And if you want
We'll make it good
Before my mood swings
[Verse 2]
Well he looked like one of those
Who would take off his clothes
Like he would peel a tangerine
Don't know what truly blind is
Once you have found out what your sign is
[Chorus]
So speak to me
Just like you should
And then you can say those wicked things
And if you want
We'll make it good
Before my mood swings
So speak to me
Just like you should
And then you can say those wicked things
And if you want
We'll make it good
Before my mood swings
So speak to me
Just like you should
And then you can say those wicked things
And if you want
We'll make it good
Before my mood swings
