[Intro: Jermaine Dupri + 
TLC
]
I've been watching
Come on, let me kick a little game to you
Baby, baby, let me kick a little game to you
Come on, let me kick a little game to you
Baby, baby, let me kick a little game to you
I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
Come on, let me kick a little game to you
[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Lean against the wall, checkin' out the scenery
All I see is everybody tryna get with me
So I continue to play it 
Crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you
[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
We just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with somethin' more clever than just your name
See it's like this, I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on
[Hook: TLC, 
Chilli
]
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Club's about to close...but you've only said a few words to me
I've been waiting for a dose of your personality
See I'm in the mood and if all goes right
Baby, you will be, you will be going home with me tonight
[Left Eye, 
as Andre
]
Miss Left Eye
 (Yo)
All I wanna do is kiss your hand
Let you know I'm not just another fan, I am the man
And I don't give a damn about who you know
I got a 48-track studio
 (Really?)
Back at the crib
So drop by, you know where I live
I see you all the time but on another note
Would you like to dance?
Nah, I'm about to go and, um, hang my coat[Hook: TLC, 
Chilli
]
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
[Verse 3: Left Eye,

Lisa Lopes
 (Huh?), 
it's been a month
I called you twice
You called me once
Baby, come with me, and be mine
So we could make love on the 50-yard line
You for me
, me for you
There's nothin' in this world you know we couldn't do
Yeah, but, uh, who, who was that girl all on your back?
Nicole
...
I'm just a nigga that followed you to the coat rack
[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
We just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with somethin' more clever than just your name
It's like this, I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me, gotta show me that your game is on
[Hook: TLC, 
Chilli

I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game[Outro: Jermaine Dupri, 
Woman

Come on, let me kick a little game to you
Baby, baby, let me kick a little game to you
Come on, let me kick a little game to you
Baby, baby, let me kick a little game to you
What's good? Who you kissin on baby?
Who cares, you ain't tryin' to take nobody else home but me
So what difference does it make?
Know I'm sayin' you know
I don't have none a these hookers in my video
Well I mean ah hey, okay. I-I-I-I respect that but uh
So like, ya know I'm sayin'
Why don't you write yo number down if you won't leave with me?
And then uh, we could hookup if ya know, ya know what I'm sayin
