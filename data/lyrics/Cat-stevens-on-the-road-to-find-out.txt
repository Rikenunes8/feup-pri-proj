Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out
I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out
Well, I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there
Many stories told me of the way to get there
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know, and I’m on the road to find out
Well in the end I’ll know, but on the way I wonder
Through descending snow, and through the frost and
Thunder
I listen to the wind come howl, telling me I have to hurry
I listen to the robin’s song saying not to worry
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know, and I’m on the road to
Find out
Then I found myself alone
Hoping someone would miss me
Thinking about my home
And the last woman to kiss me, kiss me
But sometimes you have to moan
When nothing seems to suit yer
But nevertheless you know
You’re locked towards the future
So on and on you go
The seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know
And I’m on the road to find out
Then I found my head one day when I wasn’t even trying
And here I have to say, ’cause there is no use in lying, lying
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
