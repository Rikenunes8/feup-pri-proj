400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Of the same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
And, the people, they still can't see
Why do they fight against
The youth of today?
And without youths
You'd be gone, all gone astray
Come on, let's make a move
(Make a move, make a move)
Now that the time, the time has come
Fools don't see
(Fools don't see, fools don't see)
But I know, the weak is strong
So, come with me
To a land of liberty
Where we can live
Live our lives and be free
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Of the same, the same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
And my people, still cannot see
Come with me, you black and you brown
You got to be free
Stop sittin' down on your pride
Just can't hide
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Same, same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Why do Black people close their eyes?
Come to reality
(400 years, 400 years)
You've got ability
Just can't see
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
