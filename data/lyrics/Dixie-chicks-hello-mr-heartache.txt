[Chorus]
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passing through
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
[Verse 1]
When I don't feel like company
You make yourself at home
Even though you know
I'd rather be alone
Love walked out on me
And didn't even close the door
Next thing I know I'm staring
At your shadow on the floor
[Chorus]
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passing through
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
[Verse 2]
I wish that I could say it's nice
To see you back again
We're not exactly strangers
But we're not exactly friends
You know you're not invited but
You keep on coming 'round
The last thing that I need is you
To kick me when I'm down
[Chorus]
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passing through
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you[Outro]
I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you
