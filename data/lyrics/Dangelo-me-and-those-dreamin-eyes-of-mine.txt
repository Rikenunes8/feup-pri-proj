[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, woo-ooh
[Verse 1]
When I first saw you, baby, baby, I wanted to die
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine started to cry (Woah, woah)
Then I'd dream (Oh, yeah)
Wishin' my fantasy (Oh) would soon become a reality (Oh)
'Cause every time I see you baby, baby, all I do is sigh
'Cause you're the most precious thing, baby
That my dreamin' eyes has ever seen (Oh, baby)
So I continue to dream
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
(Is it just)
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw?
(Is it my)
Or is my imagination runnin' too far?
(Oh, yeah)
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see?
(Oh)
Somethin' like me being with you and you being with me
[Chorus]
Ooh-wee, baby, you've redefined my vision of love, it seems (You be the cherry)
You're gon' be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams (Oh)
So it seems, my, oh, my (My)
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine (Oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
Oh, my goodness, here she comes switching that ass
I wonder if the men in her past treated her bad
But if I had the chance (I'd treat her)
I'd treat her like a queen (Just like a queen)
Just like I do in all my dreams, yeah (Oh-oh-oh)
If you only knew how many times, yeah (That I think of you)
I'm quite sure that you would find, yeah (I'm sure that you would find)
I'm going out my mind, oh, my
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine (Oh, yeah)[Pre-Chorus]
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw?
(Or is it my)
Or is my imagination runnin' too far?
(Sugar, you know, sugar, you know)
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see?
(Oh, oh, yeah)
Somethin' like me being with you and you being with me
(Oh, baby)
[Chorus]
Ooh-wee, baby, you've redefined my vision of love, it seems (You be the cherry)
You're gon' be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams (So it seems)
So it seems, my, oh, my (Baby, my, my, my, my, my, my)
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine (Yeah)

Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw?

Or is my imagination runnin' too far?
(Runnin' too far away from me)
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see?
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Somethin' like me being with you and you being with me
(Woah, woo)[Chorus]
Ooh-wee, baby, you've redefined my vision of love, it seems (Baby, baby, baby)
You're gon' be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams (Oh, yeah)
