[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want to leave you
Sometimes I want to go
Right back where I came from
Back where I belong
But it never lasts for too long
Always goes away
Well, I still don't look for reasons
That's much too hard these days
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why worry about the rain?
Why worry about the thunder?
Honey, Century City's got everything covered
[Verse 2]
Well your mama gave you loving
Mama held you near
Baby, Mama can't do nothing
Honey, Mama just ain't here
And you can pretend all you want to
But that won't work no more
No, you can't run back to Daddy
Yeah, you tried that once before
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why worry about your father?
Why worry about your mother?
Honey Century City's got everything covered
[Chorus]
We're going to live in
(Century City)
Go ahead and give in
(Century City)
Like modern men, modern girls
We're going to live in the modern world
Whoa!
[Guitar Solo][Chorus]
We're going to live in
(Century City)
Go ahead and give in
(Century City)
Like modern men, modern girls
We're going to live in the modern world
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I get discouraged
Sometimes I feel so down
Sometimes I get so worried
But I don't know what about
But it works out in the long run
Always goes away
And I've come now to accept it
As a reoccurring phase
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't worry about the rain
Don't worry about the thunder
Honey, Century City's got everything covered
[Outro]
We're going to live in
(Century City)
We're going to live in
(Century City)
We're going to live in
(Century City)
We're going to live in
(Century City)
