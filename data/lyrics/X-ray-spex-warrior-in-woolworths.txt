Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
[Verse 1]
Warrior in Woolworth's
Humble he may seem
Behind his serville innocence
He plots and he schemes
[Chorus]
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
[Verse 2]
Warrior in Woolworth's
His roots are in today
Doesn't know no history
He threw the past away
[Chorus]
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
[Sax Solo]
[Chorus]
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior[Verse 3]
Warrior in Woolworth's
Dips on Friday nights
Youths meet at Stockwell tube
Weapons rule their lives
[Chorus]
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
[Sax Solo]
[Chorus]
He's the rebel on the underground
She's the rebel of the modern town
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
Warrior, warrior, warri-, warrior
