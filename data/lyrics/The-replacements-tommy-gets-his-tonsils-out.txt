[Intro]
Tommy gets his tonsils out
Hi Susie, do you know what?
I've been in the hospital
[Verse 1]
Now open wide, the doctor's here
Everything is fine, got nothing to fear
Strap 'em down, we're outta gas
Stop your bawling, you little brat
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get this over with, I tee off in a hour
Didn't wash up, yesterday I took a shower
Get this over with, I tee off in an hour
My Cadillac's running, let's
[Chorus]
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
[Verse 2]
Open wide, you little snot
That's the way we knock 'em out
Got nothing to fear, got nothing to be afraid of
Doctor's here, nothing to be afraid of
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get this over with, I tee off in an hour
Did I wash up?
Yesterday, I took myself a shower
My Cadillac's running
[Chorus]
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now[Outro]
How ya doin'?
How do you feel later, after the operation?
Can I come by?
I'm really feeling terrible
