[Verse 1]
Move, down the road I go
Move, down the road I go
There's mud in the water
Roach in the cellar
Bugs in the sugar
Mortgage on the home
Mortgage on the home
[Verse 2]
There's garbage on the sidewalk
Highways in the back yard
Police on the corner
Mortgage on the car
Mortgage on the car
Move, down the road I go
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3]
They're selling independence
Actors in the White House
Acid indigestion
Mortgage on my life
Mortgage on my life
Move, down the road I go
[Outro]
Ramble tamble
Ramble tamble
Ramble tamble
