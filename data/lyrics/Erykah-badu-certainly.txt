Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly not me
Who told you that it was alright to love me
Certainly not me
I was not looking for no love affair, baby
And now you wanna fix me
I was not looking for no love affair, papa
And now you want to mould me
Was not looking for no love affair, baby
Now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna control me
Hold me
I know you're tryna' get creative with my love
And that's alright, but
You tried to get a little tricky, turned my back
And then you slipped me a mickey
Certainly Certainly (You I know I wasn't ready)
Certainly Certainly (for that mickey baby!)
Certainly Certainly
Certainly Certainly
The world is mine
When I wake up
I don't need nobody telling me the time
Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly not me
Who told you that it was alright to love me
Certainly, certainly not me
I was not looking for no love affair, papa
And now you wanna fix me
I was not looking for no love affair
And now you want to mould me
Was not looking for no love affair
Now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna control me
Hold meI know you're tryna' get creative with my love
And that's alright, but
You tried to get a little tricky, turned my back
And then you slipped me a mickey
Certainly Certainly
Certainly Certainly
Certainly Certainly
Certainly Certainly
You know that the world is mine
When I wake up
I don't nobody telling me the time, no!
The world is mine, mine, mine, mine
I don't need no little rollin over looking after me!
