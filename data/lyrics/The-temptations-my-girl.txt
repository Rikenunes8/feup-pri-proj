[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
[Verse 2]
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah
[Verse 3]
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)[Outro]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin 'bout, talkin 'bout my girl
Ooh, my girl
That's all I can talk about is my girl
Why don't you believe she's all my girl
