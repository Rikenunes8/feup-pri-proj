I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I
Somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company--wait and see, wait and see
I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine
Now, that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you broke mine
Sit there applauding from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you broke mine, broke mine
