[Verse]
They were so much in love with life
Happy in every way
But love the movie began with
Somehow got lost in the play
Like a fire burning out of control
You got caught up in the actor's role
And you cried on my shoulder
When it came to an end
[Verse]
But that's all in the movies
It won't happen to you and I
That's all in the movies
So, baby, don't cry
It's all in the movies
It won't happen to us, I know
It's all in the movies
Just a bad picture show
[Verse]
That's all in the movies
It won't happen to you and I
That's all in the movies
So, baby, don't cry
It's all in the movies
It can't happen to us, I know
It's all in the movies
Just a bad picture show
