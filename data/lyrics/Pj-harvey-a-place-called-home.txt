[Verse 1]
One day I know
We'll find a place of hope
Just hold on to me
Just hold on to me
Walk tight, one line
You're wanted this time
There's no one to blame
Just hold on to me
[Chorus]
Come on, my love
And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
And the bells keep ringing
Come on, my love
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing
[Verse 2]
I walk, I wade
Through full lands and lonely
I stumble
I stumble
With you I wait
To be born again
With love comes the day
Just hold on to me
[Chorus]
Come on, my love
And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day there'll be a place for us
And the bells keep ringing
Come on, my love
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing
[Bridge]
Now is the time
To follow through, to read the signs
Now the message sent
Let's bring it to its final end[Chorus]
Come on, my love
And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day there'll be a place for us
And the bells keep ringing
Come on, my love
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing
Come on, my love
And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day there'll be a place for us
And the bells keep ringing
Come on, my love
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing[Outro]
Come on, my love
One day I know
One day there'll be a place for us
There'll be a place called home
One day there'll be a place for us
