[Intro]
Whoah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[Verse 1]
Well, we can't take her this week
And her friends don't want another speech
Hoping for a better day
To hear what she's got to say
[Chorus 1]
All about that personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
But now, frustration and heartache is what you got
(That's why they talk about personality, hey)
(Personality)
[Verse 2]
But now, you're tryin' to be something, now, you got to do something
Wanna be someone who counts
But you're thinkin' about the times you did, they took every ounce
Well, it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout
You got to contradict all those times you butterflyin' about
(You was butterflyin')
[Chorus 2]
'Bout that personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
It's always hot, you know it's frustration and heartache is what you got
(Ow! I've gotta talk about personality, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And you're a prima ballerina on a spring afternoon
Change on into the wolfman, howlin' at the moon, hooowww
[Chorus 2]
About that personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
It's always hot, you know it's frustration and heartache is what you got
(That's why they always talk about personality)
[Verse 3]
Now, with all the crossin' fingers that mother nature sends
Your mirrors getting jammed up with all your friends
That personality, everything is starting to blend (Not like the one)
Personality, when your mind starts to blend
Got so much personality, impression of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend
Personality, wonderin' how celebrities ever mend
(Lookin' fine on television)[Outro]
Personality crisis, you got it while it was hot
It's always hot, you know it's frustration and heartache is all you got
Ohh, don't you worry
Personality crisis, please don't cry
It's just a personality crisis, please, don't stop
Because you walk a personality
Talk a personality
