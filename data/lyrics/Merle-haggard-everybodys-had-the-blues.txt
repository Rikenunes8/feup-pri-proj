[Verse]
Everybody's had the blues sometimes
And everybody knows the tune
And everybody knows the way I'm feeling
Cause everybody's had the blues
[Chorus][x2]
A lonely, song someone is gone, a story old as time
Love, hate, or want and wait until misery fills your mind
But everybody knows the way I'm felling
Because everybody's had the blues
