[Verse 1]
Put it on and don't say a word
Put it on, the one that I prefer
Put it on and stand before my eyes
Put it on, please don't question why
Can you believe
[Chorus]
Something so simple
Something so trivial
Makes me a happy man
Can't you understand?
Say you believe
Just how easy it is to please me
Because when you learn
You'll know what makes the world turn
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Put it on, I can feel so much
Put it on, I don't need to touch
Put it on, here before my eyes
Put it on because you realise
And you believe
[Chorus]
Something so worthless
Serves a purpose
It makes me a happy man
Can't you understand?
Say you believe
Just how easy it is to please me
Because when you learn
You'll know what makes the world turn
