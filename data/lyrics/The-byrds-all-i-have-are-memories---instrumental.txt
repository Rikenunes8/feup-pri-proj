The first thing that I heard you say when you were standing there
Set in your way was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me cause there was nothing there
That you could see that could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door remembering the days before
And asking please be kind

It isn't how it was set up to be but I've set you free this time
I have never been so far out in front that I could ever ask for what I want
And have it any time
Knowing this you found a thought for me that told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that went before and memories that always seems to
Tear me from my mind

It isn't how it was set up to be but I've set you free this time

I could never find a chance to choose between a way to win or a
Thing to lose because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
There was only something you can look at lying in your hand
Now who's wondering what has changed and why it can not be arranged
To have each thing work fine

It isn't how it was set up to be but I've set you free this time
