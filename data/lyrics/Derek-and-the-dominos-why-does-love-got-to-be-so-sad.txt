[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Gotta find me a way to get me back to yesterday
How can I ever hope to forget you?
Won't you show me a place where I could hide my lonely face?
I know you're gonna break my heart if I let you
[Chorus]
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
[Verse 2]
Like a moth to the flame, like a song without a name
I've never been the same since I met you (woah, oh)
Like a bird on the wing, got a brand new song to sing
I can't keep from singing about you
[Chorus]
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 3]
I'm beginning to see what a fool you've made of me
I might have to break the law when I find you (yes, I will now)
Stop running away, I got a better game to play
You know I can't go on living without you, no
[Chorus]
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so, ooh[Outro]
Woah
Why does love got to be so
Why does love got to be so
