[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being told what to think
I'm tired of being told what to do
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
[Chorus]
Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
Alright
[Verse 2]
Take your fucking money and shove it up your arse
'Cause you think you understand, well it's a fucking farce
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
[Chorus]
Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
Alright
[Verse 3]
And if you turn and walk out that door
And take your fucking money, let me tell you what it's for
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
[Chorus]
Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
