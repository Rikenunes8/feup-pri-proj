[Verse 1]
I wish a buck was still silver
It was back when the country was strong
Back before Elvis
And before the Vietnam War came along
Before The Beatles and "Yesterday"
When a man could still work, and still would
[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?
[Chorus]
And are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for
The flag or the Liberty Bell
I wish a Ford and a Chevy
Would still last ten years, like they should
[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?
[Verse 2]
I wish coke was still cola
And a joint was a bad place to be
And it was back before Nixon
Lied to us all on TV
Before microwave ovens
When a girl could still cook, and still would
[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?
[Chorus]
Are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for
The flag or the Liberty Bell
I wish a Ford and a Chevy
Would still last ten years, like they should[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?
[Chorus]
Stop rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell
Stand up for the flag
And let's all ring the Liberty Bell
Let's make a Ford and a Chevy
That'll still last ten years, like they should
[Outro]
'Cause the best of the free life is still yet to come
And the good times ain't over for good
