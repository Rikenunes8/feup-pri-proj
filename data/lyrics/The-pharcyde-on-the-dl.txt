[Verse 1: SlimKid 3]
So here it is, fuck it, friends or no friends I had enough bullshit
To last me clear to the ends of my term
I hate worms, so I'ma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand to refrain from my fist
Yeah I wish that I change then I could shed all the mains
You trippin' on my ego but all my shit is sustained
Order order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch I could chill as a bum (ho hum)
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my fears on my nerves and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting heavy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe my friends you slip me
I might have the ego but you'll tell me who're tripping
I know and it shows, I can look at your nose
And just tell that you're effected by the e-g-o

[Verse 2: Buc Fifty]
I woke up in the mornin' to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'mma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before, and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the nasty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mike with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next, well you're just too dense

On the downlow[Verse 3: Imani]
He's chasin' me, scrapin' my knee on the cement is what I did
What dug, look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night -stalker slug, but know, this nigga had to go
Peep this, I was asleep, he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-m-a-n-i
First I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head you know Imani feels no shame
I've got my nine I said, with my millimeter go bang
I got him, he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang bang bang, yep I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But um anyway I'm just protectin' my shit
Cause if it wasn't me he's killin' then my moms mighta got it
It's on the downlow
Don't tell nobody I killed him all right?

'Cause you should know[Verse 4: SlimKid 3]
Flip fly caught you soarin sky high
But a fly slip wash you up fly drip my
Eyes cry, tears fear
A baby eagle seagull shit falls quicker than a local hero
Zero from zero leaves nothin', now ain't that somethin'?
And all this time you been wantin' somethin' for nothin'
The crew has pushed your button 'cause your frame is on recall
The homies kick the fact 'cause its wack to let you fall
(why doesn't what) you're rollin in the 'hood so niggas that don't wantcha
And you're fucked, crazy fucked, like the slut Heather Hunter
(with me) the one that punches shit, I know you'll get the pick
With the cars and the girls and the ego and the loot chief
I'll make this brief, I'd be lyin through my teeth
If I told you you was dope and your benefits was reaped
From my ego, those (libro) kids are creepin' with the steel
And you're cappin' 'bout this rappin' and they're cavin' in the grille
