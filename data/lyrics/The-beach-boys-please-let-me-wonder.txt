[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Now here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always knew it'd feel this way
And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Group
]
Baby, please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love
[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through
For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Group
]
Baby, please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love
[Instrumental Bridge: Lead organ and guitar]
[Chorus: Brian Wilson, 
Group
]
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love
[Outro: Carl Wilson]
I love you
