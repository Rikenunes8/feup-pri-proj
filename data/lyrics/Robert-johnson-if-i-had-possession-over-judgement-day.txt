If I had possession, over judgment day
If I had possession, over judgment day
Lord, the little woman I'm loving wouldn't, have no right to pray
And I went to the mountain, looking as far as my eyes could see
And I went to the mountain, looking as far as my eyes would see
Some other man got my woman, and these lonesome blues got me
And I rolled and I tumbled and I, cried the whole night long
And I rolled and I tumbled and I, cried the whole night long
Boy, I woke up this morning, my biscuit roller gone
Had to fold my arms and I, slowly walked away
(I didn't like the way she done)
Had to fold my arms and I, slowly walked away
I said in my mind, "Yo' trouble gon' come some day"
Now run here, baby, set down on my knee
Now run here, baby, set down on my knee
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me
