[Verse 1]
Got struck by the first volley
Of the war in the court
Never held my serve
Send 'em a wire, give 'em my best
This ammunition never rests
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up
[Chorus]
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me
[Chorus]
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me
[Verse 2]
I can see the lines open shutters
And the leaves flocked on a grid
That's what they made my hero say
Nothing gets me off so completely
Then when you put it down, ten feet down in the ground
Call it response, negative home
[Chorus]
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me
[Chorus]
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me[Guitar Solo]
