I am trapped in a flood, but it isn't raining
I have a tendency to get bored too quickly
Recently my dull life seems to have no meaning
I am stuck with someone, we're not communicating
I want to buy
(Have you been affected?)
I need consoling
(You could be addicted)
I need something new
Something trivial would do
I want to satisfy this empty feeling
Walking down the street looking in the windows
The TV, the lights flickering in other peoples windows
Imagine myself moving in the kitchens
Somehow I don't know, it just looks so tempting
I want to buy
(Have you been affected?)
I need consoling
(You could be addicted)
I need something new
Something trivial would do
I want to satisfy this empty feeling
I've got a new, improved remedy
Two of my lonely fantasies ?????
When I supply myself with something new...
Going home, into bed when I've treated myself
I've been quite hard, after a hard day's work
I have found a hundred ways to get rid of all my worries
He's not pillaging, stopping me, committing a crime
I have to buy
(Have you been affected?)
I need consoling
(You could be addicted)
I need something new
Something trivial would do
I want to satisfy this empty feelingI've got a new improved remedy
Two of my lonely fantasies
