[Verse 1]
Oh, Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't take no mess
Papa is the man who can understand
How a man has to do
Whatever he can
[Chorus]
Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess, no
Papa don't take no mess
[Verse 2]
Now Papa might grin
Drink a little taste of gin
Bet his last ten
On a little game of skins
Hit me
[Chorus]
Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess, hey, hey[Verse 3]
Papa digs the chick if she look real slick
Papa rap is very quick
He definitely isn't no trick
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess
Papa is the man
Who will take a stand
Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, don't, Papa don't
Look, dig this
[Verse 4]
Papa didn't cuss
He didn't raise a whole lotta fuss
But when we did wrong
Papa beat the hell out of us
[Chorus]
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't take no mess[Verse 5]
I saw Papa cry when he
Thought that I would die
Lookie here
I saw Papa cry
I saw Papa cry when he
Thought that I would die
He says something was in his eye
I knew it was a lie
Papa loves his son
Mama said Papa's smart
Papa got a whole lot of heart
And Papa would do his part
When the game get hard, hit me
