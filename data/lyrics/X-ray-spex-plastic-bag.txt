My mind is like a plastic bag....
[Chorus]
It's 1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads
It's 1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag
[Verse 1]
My mind is like a plastic bag
That corresponds to all those ads
It sucks up all the rubbish
That is fed in through by ear
I eat kleenex for breakfast
And I use soft hygienic Weetabix
To dry my tears
[Chorus]
1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads
1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag
[Verse 2]
My mind is like a switchboard
With crossed and tangled lines
Contented with confusion
That is plugged into my head
I don't know what's going on
It's the operators job, not mine
I said
[Chorus]
It's 1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen to many ads
It's 1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag
[Verse 3]
My dreams I daren't remember
Or tell you what I've seen
I dreamt that I was Hitler
The ruler of the sea
The ruler of the universe
The ruler of the supermarkets
And even fatalistic me[Chorus]
It's 1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads
It's 1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag!
