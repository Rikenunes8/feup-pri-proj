Tell me, who in this house know about the Quake?
(We do!) I mean really, really
If you know how to rock, say, "Yeah" (Yeah!)
If you know how to party, say, "Oh yeah" (Oh yeah!)
But if you ain't hip to the rare Housequake
Shut up, already, damn!
[Chorus 1]
Housequake, everybody jump up and down
Housequake, there's a brand new groove going 'round
(Housequake!) In your funky town
(Housequake!) And the kick drum is the fault
You gotta rock this mother, say (Housequake!)
We gotta rock this mother, say (Housequake!)
[Verse 1]
We gonna to show you what to do
You put your foot down on the two
You jump up on the one
Now you're having fun, huh
You're doin' the Housequake, hey
Question, does anybody know about the Quake? (Yeah!)
Bullshit! You can't get off
Until you make the house shake
Now everybody clap your hands, come on!
Let's jam, y'all, let's jam
Don't wait for your neighbor
Green eggs and ham
[Chorus 2]
Doin' the Housequake
There's a brand new groove going 'round
In your city, in your town, Housequake
And the kick drum is the fault
Housequake (Housequake!)
Housequake, you gotta rock this mother
(Gotta rock this mother)
Housequake, Housequake
You gotta rock this mother down, come on!
Uh, Housequake
Uh, Housequake[Verse 2]
Now that you got it, let's do the Twist
A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist, little sister, and go to Heaven
Come on, y'all, we got to jam
Before the police come
A groove this funky is on the run, hey, uh!
Shake your body 'til your neighbors stare atcha!
(Quake, quake, quake, quake, quake, quake)
[Chorus 3]
Housequake, everybody, everybody jump up and down
Housequake, there's a brand new groove going 'round

Housequake, and the saxophone is the fault, check it out
If you can't Rocksteady, shut up, already!
Damn! You got to get off!

On the one, y'all say, "Housequake!"
Top of your body, let me hear you shout
[Chorus 4]
Say (Housequake!) My lord!

We gonna to shake, we gonna quake
'Cause we got the baddest groove that a-we could make
We on the two, y'all, the drummer's gonna tap
We gonna see if we can rock this mother to the max
And that's a fact
Housequake, come on, say it!
(Housequake!) Woo! Come on!

We got the baddest jam in the land
[Outro 2]
Everybody shut up, listen to the band
