Call me, call me, call me
[Verse 1]
What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other, yeah
Just remember the time we had
And how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work
Call me
[Verse 2]
Losing your love, acting foolishly
Go on and take your time
'Cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here
Tell you, it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real
Come to me
[Chorus]
Call me, call me, call me
Come back home
[Verse 3]
The best thing I can do is give you your love
(is give you your love, baby)
Let you go on your way
Feeling as free as a dove
And if you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong
Just call on me baby
Come back home
[Chorus]
Call me, call me
Come back home
Call me, call me
Come back home
[Bridge]
When you're worried
Things ain't going right, yeah
It's all in a day's work
Call me
When you're lonely
You can call me
When you're feeling sad, baby
Oh oh oh, yeah
It's all in a day's work
Come back home[Chorus]
Call me, call me
Come back home
Call me
