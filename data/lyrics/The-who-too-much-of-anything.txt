[Verse 1]
I think these hands have felt a lot
I don't know, what have I touched?
I think these eyes have seen a lot
I don't know, maybe they've seen too much
[Verse 2]
I think this brain has thought a lot
Searching, trying to find a crutch
I think this heart has bled once too often
This time, it's bled a bit too much
[Chorus]
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much, and everything gets too much for me
[Verse 3]
I can't remember before '49
But I know '48 was there
My ears let in what I should speak out
Hmmm, there's something in the air
[Verse 4]
I've overloaded on my way
Bye-bye, you better keep in touch
I think your ears hear a whole lot of music
And like me, you've heard a bit too much
[Chorus]
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much, and everything gets too much for me
[Verse 1]
I think these hands have felt a lot
I don't know, what have I touched?
I think these eyes have seen a lot
I don't know, maybe they've seen too much[Verse 5]
I think this brain has thought a lot
Searching, trying to find a crutch
I think this heart has bled once too often
This time, it's bled a bit too much
[Chorus]
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much, and everything gets too much for me
