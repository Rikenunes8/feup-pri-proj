[Verse 1]
Sweet summer days when I was feeling so fine
Just you and me, girl, it was a beautiful time
Ah yeah, said I felt so happy
My, my, my
[Chorus 1]
I was through with doubt and pain
All the love I felt hadn't been in vain
Got damaged, I got damaged
I got damaged, I lost myself in you
[Verse 2]
I'd wake up beside you, you'd hold me in your arms
Nothing and nobody's gonna do me any harm
Ah yeah, said I felt so happy
My, my, my
[Chorus 2]
And the way I felt inside
Made me feel so glad to be alive
Got damaged, I got damaged
I got damaged, I lost myself in you
[Bridge]
I never felt so happy
I never felt so happy
I never felt so happy
I'll never feel that way again
No, no, no, no, no, no
My, my, my
[Verse 3]
People can be precious, but they ain't for keeping
I got too possessive, but souls ain't for stealing
You were my addiction, I got strung out and crazy
Hit me like a fever when you left me, baby[Outro]
Stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Was stone, stone, stone in love with you, was stone
