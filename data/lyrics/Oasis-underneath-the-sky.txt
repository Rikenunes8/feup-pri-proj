[Verse 1]
Underneath the sky of red
Is a storyteller sleeping alone
He has no face and he has no name
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown
[Chorus]
All he needs is his life in a suitcase
It belongs to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
[Verse 2]
So wish me away to an unknown place
Am I living in a land with no name
I'll be making a start with my brand new heart
Stop me making sense once again
[Chorus]
All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend's
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
[Piano solo]
[Outro]
All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend's
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Again, again
Underneath the sky again
