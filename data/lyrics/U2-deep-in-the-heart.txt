Angel, everything is gonna be alright
Angel, everything is gonna work out tonight
Thirty years old
Sweet as a rose
Every petal of her wafer thin
Love will make you blind
Creep up from behind
Get you jumping out of your skin
Angel, it's sink or swim
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Door is closed behind me now
The window is sealed to shut out the light
Green as the leaves
And the cure of the nettle sting
Do your work, it'll work out right
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
The scent of cedar
I can still see her
You can't return to the place you never left
Angel, we'll make it work out tonight
Angel, I wanna be home tonight
Door is closed behind me now
Window's sealed, to shut out the light
Green as the leaves, the cure of the nettle sting
Do your work and you'll work out rightOh ho, oh ho
Oh ho, oh ho
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
