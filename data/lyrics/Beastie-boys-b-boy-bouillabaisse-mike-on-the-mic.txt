[Intro]
Here's another one for y'all to peep
It's called M-I-K-E on the M-I-C
[Mike D]
See... I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait, and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinnin' 'round like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way, then they're going to finish me
You might know this, but you've never been this, see?
If I ate spinach I'd be called Spinach D
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like I'm Raymond Burr
I'm so high that they call me Your Highness
So if you don't know me, then pardon my shyness
I live in the Village, wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
{"It's a trip... it's got a FUNKY beat
And I can bug out to it!"}
