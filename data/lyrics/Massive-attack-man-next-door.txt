[Verse 1]
There's a man that lived next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down
[Verse 2]
He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night
[Chorus]
I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
And find a quiet place
[Verse 3]
Hear the pots and pans, they fall
Bang against the wall
Bang against the wall
No rest at all
[Verse 2]
He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night
[Chorus]
I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
And find a quiet place
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip…Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip…
[Verse 1]
There's a man that lived next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down
[Verse 2]
He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night
[Outro]
Gotta get away
Ohh, ahhh
Oh, ah, ah
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip…
