There’s no such thing as love
It’s all a bunch of lies
They’ll tell you what you want
To get between your thighs
The fear of dying alone
Will eventually come true for you
You push it all away
How do you live with these mistakes you’ve made
You worship and defeat
You know it’s all lost on me
Once you were a king
Now you’ve finally set me free
You dig your own grave
You dig your own grave
Now you’re off to find yourself
When you finally come back I'm gone
Selfish and alone
How do you live with these mistakes you made
A wish you could have made
You could have changed up the whole game
These chances that you take
You know you dig your own grave
