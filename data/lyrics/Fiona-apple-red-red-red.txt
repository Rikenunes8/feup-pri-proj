[Verse 1]
I don't understand about complementary colors
And what they say
Side by side they both get bright
Together, they both get gray
[Chorus 1]
But he's been pretty much yellow
And I've been kind of blue
But all I can see is
Red, red, red, red, red
Now, what am I gonna do?
[Verse 2]
I don't understand about diamonds
And why men buy them
What's so impressive about a diamond
Except the mining?
[Chorus 2]
But it's dangerous work
Trying to get to you, too
And I think if I didn't have to kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it
Maybe I wouldn't think so much of you
[Bridge]
I've been watching all the time
And I still can't find the tack
But I wanna know is, is it okay?
Is it just fine?
Or is it my fault?
Is it my lack?
[Verse 3]
I don't understand about
The weather outside
Or the harmony in a tune
Or why somebody lied[Chorus 3]
But there's solace a bit in submitting
To the fitfully, cryptically true
What's happened, has happened
What's coming is already on its way
With a role for me to play
[Outro]
And I don't understand
I never understand
But I'll try to understand
There's nothing else I can do
