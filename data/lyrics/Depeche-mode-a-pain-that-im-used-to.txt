[Verse 1: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymore
I just know that I'm harder to 
console
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of 
control
[Interlude]
[Verse 2: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
Can you say what you're trying to play anyway?
I just pay while you're breaking all the 
rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is 
fueled
[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
All this running around
, well, it's 
getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't 
need to believe
 all the 
dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
[Interlude]
[Verse 3: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
There's a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience repentance 
unknown
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds that are 
sown[Interlude]
[Verse 4: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real
No mistaking the faking, I 
care
With a prayer in the air, I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not 
despair
[Chorus 2: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
All this running 
around
, well, it's 
getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to 
believe
 all the 
dreams you conceive
You just need to 
achieve something that rings true
All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
