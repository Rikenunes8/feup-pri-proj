[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day (don't, don't, don't)
Who did I meet? (don't, don't, don't)
I met a friend of mine and he did say (don't, don't, don't)
"Man, I can smell your feet a mile away"
[Chorus]
Smile away, smile away, smile away
(Learning how to do that, learning how to do that)
Yeah, smile away

Smile away, smile away, smile away
