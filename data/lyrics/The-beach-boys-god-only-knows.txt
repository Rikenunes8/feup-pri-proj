[Verse 1: Carl Wilson]
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
[Refrain: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you
[Verse 2: Carl Wilson]
If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
[Refrain: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you
[Interlude: Carl Wilson, Brian Wilson, and Bruce Johnston]
Ooh, ooh
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
[Refrain: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you
[Verse 3: Carl Wilson]
If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
[Chorus: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

Brian Wilson
