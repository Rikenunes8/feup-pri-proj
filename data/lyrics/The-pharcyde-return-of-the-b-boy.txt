[Verse 1: Slimkid3]
Ah

Of a beat y'all, I stand tall gets raw like beef y'all
I moo moo like a cow honey-child, or, ooh, ah one two
'Cause I check it, baby just lend me your ear
For a second, 'cause I'm 
wreckin eardrums cold Black-N-Deckin
Hold on the horse cause the force is like dark
If you can't slide then stay out the park
And if my preachers don't know ya then hop off the ark
Are you hip? Do you need another tip, cause that's
Just like a talk light, in the asscrack tip
Jump onnn it!
 Shake your shit, if you want it
Show no shame, hey Malik god damn get your arrow and hang
It ain't no thang to 
jam on it, jam onnn it

You don't stop
)

Came to rock the b-boys and the young ladies
Gonna rhyme on the microphone all night long
So the party won't stop until the break of dawn
It's like that y'all, it's like this y'all

If you're sparkin blunts with clean underwear
Somebody say,

OHHH YEAHHH!
 And ya don't stop
Yo, cause back in eighty-nine I was doin the wop
Back and forth, forth and back
I'm from the streets now I'm a straight mack
Skin is black (what?) Hair is brown (what?)
Eyes are red, you know that I can get down
When I get up on the mic, I kick the rhymes to life
Because I'm fresh, and I'm def tonightYeah, yeah, uh-huh!

We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn!!
[Verse 4: Fatlip]

That I'm a super def rapper comin straight from L.A
5'10' brown skin twenty three years old
And all the ladies love me 'cause I'm pigeon-toed

Cold rock the mic with the hip-hop groove
