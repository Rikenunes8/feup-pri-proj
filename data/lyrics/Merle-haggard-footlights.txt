[Chorus]
I live the kind of life that most men only dream of
I make my living writing songs and singing them
But I'm forty-one years old
And I ain't got no place to go when it's over
But I'll hide my age and make the stage
And try to kick the footlights out again
[Verse]
I throw my old guitar across the stage
And then my bassman takes the ball
And the crowd goes nearly wild
To see my guitar nearly fall
After twenty years of picking, we're still alive
And kicking down the wall
Tonight I'll kick the footlights out
And walk away without a curtain call
Tonight I'll kick the footlights out again
And try to hide the mood I'm really in
And put on my old Instamatic grin
Tonight I'll kick the footlights out again
[Chorus]
I live the kind of life that most men only dream of
I make my living writing songs and singing them
But I'm forty-one years old
And I ain't got no place to go when it's over
So I'll hide my age and make the stage
And try to kick the footlights out again
