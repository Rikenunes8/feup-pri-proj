[Verse 1]
My coffee's cold, my paper's old
My heart is sold to melancholia
My clothes are torn, my shoes are worn
My heart is born to melancholia
[Verse 2]
A strange surprise, what I despised
In other guys is here in me
They lose their girl, they lose their world
And then they cry for all to see
[Chorus]
I've never felt so bad
The virus drives me mad
[Verse 3]
The sheets are grey, left since the day
She went away, I lost all power
The dust is thick, the dog is sick
The kids have picked most of the flowers
[Bridge]
The sun is shining
But not for me
The sun is shining
But not for me
[Chorus]
I've never felt so bad
The virus drives me mad
[Verse 4]
The sheets are grey, left since the day
She went away, I lost all power
The dog is sick, the dust is thick
The kids have picked most of the flowers
