[Verse 1]
Ghost, ghost, I know you live within me feel as you fly
In thunderclouds above the city into one that I
Love with all that was left within me til we tore in two
Now wings and rings and there's so many waiting here for you
And she was born in a bottle-rocket in 1929
With wings that ringed around a socket right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever, she won't ever die
[Chorus]
And she goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
Where no-one can escape
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Deee-dee-dee-deee
[Verse 2]
And one day in New York City, baby, a girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building 14 stories high
And when her spirit left
 
her body, how it split the sun
I know that she will live forever, all goes on and on and on
[Chorus]
And she goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
Where no-one can escape
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Deee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
