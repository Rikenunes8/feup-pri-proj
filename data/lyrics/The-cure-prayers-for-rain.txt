[Verse 1]
You shatter me, your grip on me
A hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me, infectious sense
Of hopelessness and prayers for rain
[Verse 2]
I suffocate, I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain
[Chorus]
You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain
[Verse 3]
I deteriorate, I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain
[Chorus]
You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain[Outro]
Prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
