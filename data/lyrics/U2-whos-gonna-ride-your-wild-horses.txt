[Verse 1]
You're dangerous 'cos you're honest
You're dangerous 'cos you don't know what you want
Well, you left 
my heart empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt
Hey hey, sha la la, hey hey
[Verse 2]
You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass left there on the beach
Well you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach
Hey hey, sha la la
Hey hey, sha la la
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee
[Verse 3]
Well you stole it 'cos I needed the cash
And you killed it 'cos I wanted revenge
Well you lied to me 'cos I asked you to
Baby, can we still be friends
Hey hey, sha la la
Hey hey, sha la la
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee
[Bridge]
The deeper I spin
The hunter will sin for your ivory skin
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me
Hallelujah, heaven's white rose
The doors you open, I just can't closeDon't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
Your gypsy heart
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
And don't look back
Come on now love
Don't you look back
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses
Who's gonna take the place of me
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who could tame the heart of thee
