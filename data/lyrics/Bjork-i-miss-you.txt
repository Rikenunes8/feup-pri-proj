[Verse 1]
I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
So special
But it hasn't happened yet
You are gorgeous
But I haven't met you yet
I remember
But it hasn't happened yet
[Chorus]
And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I will meet you
[Verse 2]
I was peaking
But it hasn't happened yet
I haven't been given
My best souvenir
I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
I know your habits
But wouldn't recognise you yet
[Chorus]
And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I miss you
[Bridge]
I'm so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will I get my cuddle?
Who are you?
I know by now that you'll arrive
By the time I stop waiting
[Refrain]
I miss you
