Driving in South
The motor's on fire
Let's put it out
Before the flames go higher
Monday matinee
"
Big Bully
" or "
White Squall
"
So hard to choose
Wish we could see them all
Some college in the spring
The sound is all wrong
We set the mains
To our favorite 
Hootie song
Driving (not again)
An eight car crash
We'll turn to look
Unless we're going too fast
