The towers of London, these crumbling blocks
Reality estates that the hero's got
And every hour's marked by the chime of a clock
What you gonna do when the darkness surrounds?
You can piss in the lifts which have broken down
You can watch from the debris the last bedroom light
We're invisible here just past midnight
And the wives hate their husbands, the husbands don't care
Their children daub slogans to prove they lived there
A giant pipe organ up in the air
You can't live in a home which should not have been built
By the bourgeois clerks who bear no guilt
When the wind hits this building this building it tilts
One day it will surely fall to the ground
Fear is just another commodity here
They sell us peeping holes to peek when we hear
A bang on the door resoundingly clear
Who would really want to move in here?
The children play faraway, the corridors are bare
This room is a cage, it's like captivity
How can anyone exist in such misery?
It has been said not only here
"Allianza dollars are spent
To raise the towerin' buildings
For the weary bones of the workers
To go back in the morning"
It has been said not only here
"Allianza dollars are spent
To raise the towering buildings
For the weary bones of the workers
To be strong in the morning"
It has been said not only here
To raise the towering buildings
