[Intro]
Hey baby, that's alright people
I know that's alright
Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other
[Verse 1]
I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes
[Verse 2]
Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air
[Verse 3]
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you, right on
[Bridge]
Oh, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on
[Verse 4]
For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth (Talk about it)
[Verse 5]
For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else[Instrumental break]
[Verse 6]
Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, ah pure love
[Verse 7]
Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Ah, baby
