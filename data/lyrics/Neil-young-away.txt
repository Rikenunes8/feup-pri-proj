Fourteen junkies too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street, disappointment lurks

Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
All day presidents look out windows
All night sentries watch the moon glow
All are waiting till the time is right

Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away


Back in Canada I spent my days
Riding subways through a haze
I was handcuffed I was born and raised

Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
You know how time fades away
You know how time fades away
Thirteen junkies too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street, disappointment lurks

Son, don't be home too late, no no no
Try to get back by eight, eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

Time fades away
You know how time, time fades away
You know how time fades away
You know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
Son, son, son
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades away
