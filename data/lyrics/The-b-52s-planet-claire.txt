She came from Planet Claire
I knew she came from there
She drove a Plymouth Satellite
Oh, faster than the speed of light
Planet Claire has pink air
All the trees are red
No one ever dies there
No one has a head
Some say she's from Mars
Or one of the seven stars
That shine after 3:30 in the morning
Well, she isn't!
She came from Planet Claire
She came from Planet Claire
She came from Planet Claire
