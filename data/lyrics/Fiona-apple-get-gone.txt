[Verse 1]
How many times do I have to say
To get away, get gone?
Flip your shit past another lass's
Humble dwelling
You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot
But I'm not turned on
So put away that meat you're selling
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again
[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again
[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
Itâ€™s time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me
[Verse 2]
How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride
That I'm much obliged to up and go
I'll idealize, then realize
That it's no sacrifice because the price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve
Fuckin' go[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I've done what I've could for you
And I do know what's good for me
And I'm not benefiting
Instead I'm sitting
Singing again, singing again, singing again
Sing, sing again
[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me
