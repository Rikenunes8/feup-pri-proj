It's too late, she's gone
It's too late, my baby's gone
Wish I had told her she was my only one
It's too late, she's gone
It's a woman that cries
So I guess I've gotta dry my eyes
Yes, I will miss her more than anyone
It's too late, she's gone
She's gone (she's gone), yes she's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), my baby's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), yes she's gone (she's gone)
Where can my baby be?
And I wonder does she know
When she left me, it hurt me so
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait
Tell me it's not too late
She's gone (she's gone), yes she's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), my baby's gone (yeah she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), ooh yeah she's gone (she's gone)
Where can my baby be?
And I wonder does she know
When she left me, it hurt me so
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait
Tell me it's not too late
