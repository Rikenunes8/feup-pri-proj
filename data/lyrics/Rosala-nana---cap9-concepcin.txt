Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby

At heavenâ€™s door
They sell shoes
To the little angels
That are barefoot

No one has told you
That no dream
Knows hours or times
Or has an owner
And the rain falls sadly
To look at you
Behind every raindrop
An angel looks at you

Ea, ea
Ea, ea
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby
(Lullaby, lullaby)
Lullaby
