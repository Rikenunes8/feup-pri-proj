[Verse 1]
When am I gonna make a living?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and thieving
While the sharks are wheeling and dealing
Gotta wake up and tell yourself
There's no end to what you can do (What you do is up to you)
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
This is the time (Ah)
To start believing in yourself (Ooh, ooh)
Put the blame on no one else
[Verse 2]
When am I gonna make a living, living?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and stealing
Too many lies, no one is achieving
Haven't I told you before?
We're hungry for a life we can't afford
There's no end (No end) to what you can do (Ooh, ooh)
If you give yourself a chance to prove
[Chorus]
We are hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
We're hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
[Verse 3]
Oh, there's no end to what you can do
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
Oh, start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else[Chorus]
Not gonna give in
Hungry but we won't give in
[Verse 4]
When am I gonna make a living?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in, yes it is
I'm sick and tired of scratching a living
I am hungry but I'm not gonna give in, no
[Outro]
Hungry but we won't give in (Not gonna give in)
Hungry but we won't give in (Ooh, ooh)
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we're gonna win
Hungry but we won't give in (Not gonna give in)
Hungry but we won't give in (Ooh, ooh)
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we're gonna win
