[Verse 1]
I've been waiting
Anticipating
Sun comes up
The skies won't sink my soul
I've dreamt of this
But it never comes
But it never comes
The rising
The nature's dry
Faux
[Verse 2]
I've been dreaming
Traced out but dreaming
The sun comes up
The blisters burn my soul
I'm dreamin'
Of something now
Of something now
Of the rising
The nature's dry
And all the groovy ones
