[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
[Chorus]
Little things I should have said and done
You were always on my mind
[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
[Chorus]
If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied
