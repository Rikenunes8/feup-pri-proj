[Intro]
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can’t read
Another message I can’t read
[Verse 1]
I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down
[Chorus]
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
[Verse 2]
I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way
[Chorus]
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
This beautiful world
[Outro]
Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back
