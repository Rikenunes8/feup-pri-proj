I had a dream
I cut a frog in half
And a turtle too
To plant the top
Of the frogtoise on
The poor frogs base
Sometimes i dream of nothing
Next morning's even worse
Sometimes i wake up sweaty
Feels like i'd just given birth
Sometimes i don't wake up at all
I had a dream i cut a frog in half
And a turtle too
To plant the top
Of the frogtoise on
The poor frogs base
I'd love to meet you out there
To pet your heart and soul
Discover all your beauty
And let the good vibes flow
But i've been called by a certain duty
Cause in my dream
I cut a frog in half
And a turtle too
To plant the top
Of the tortoise on
The poor frog's base
Now what do you think
How it looked at me
The one to blame
I felt ashamed
