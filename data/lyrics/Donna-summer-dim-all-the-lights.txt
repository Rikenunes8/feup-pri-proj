[Intro]
Dim all the lights sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away
[Verse-1]
Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up
[Chorus]
Dim all the lights sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away
Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up
Dim all the lights, sweet honey
'Cause tonight it's you and me
No need to worry darlin'
Cause it's for eternity[Hook]
Love don't come easy
This you know I understand
Want to be your woman
If you'll be my man
Let yourself go freely and I'll
Show you things that you've dreamed of
Don't think that you're dreaming
We've found the perfect love
And I'm like a cup come fill me up
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Do what you want
You can use me all up
Take me bottom to top
Don't leave even one drop
[Interlude]
No, no, no do it tonight
You know the moment's so right
Turn my brown body white
Come on dim all the lights
[Outro Chorus]
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna steal you heart away, hey baby
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
Dim it, dim it, and dance the night away
Dim all the lights sweet honey
Gonna steal your heart away, keep on dancin'
Dim all the lights the lights sweet darlin', nothing
Nothing, can steal my heart away
