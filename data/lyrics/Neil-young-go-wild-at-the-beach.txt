Watch out Stephen, here I come

The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are falling
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day to day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face 'em day to day
Though my problems are meaningless
That don't make them go away
I need a crowd of people
I can't face them day to day


Well, I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
And ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm living out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still way out of reach
Went to the radio interview

Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Gonna head for the sticks with my bus and friends
Gonna follow the road, though I don't know where it ends
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
'Cause the world is turning
And I don't wanna see it turn away

Thank you
