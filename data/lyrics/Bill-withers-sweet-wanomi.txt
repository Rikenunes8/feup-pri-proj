[Verse 1]
In a room with soft satin pillows
Cracklin' fireplace keeps us warm
Whisperin' wind through weepin' willows
And sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
In a soft light her eyes are gleamin'
Pretty little hand covers up her mouth when she yawns
Wake me up, I must be dreamin' that
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sleepy kisses, warm me softly
Get much warmer later on
I reach for the light, and turn it off
Uh-huh, sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
[Instrumental break]
[Verse 2]
Sleepy kisses, warm me softly
Get much warmer later on
I reach for the light, and turn it off
Uh-huh, sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
[Outro]
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
