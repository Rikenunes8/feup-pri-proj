[Verse 1]
Look at the morning sun, shining so brightly
Love is in the air, I don't care
Look at the smiling faces
Makes me know that no one can take your place
(Your place), your place, (Your place), your place
[Chorus]
Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
(Your love, your love, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
All the skies are gray, now messing up my day
I'd never leave you in this way, oh, no, no, never, never
Throwing up my hands, not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay?
Hey hey
[Chorus]
Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
(Your love, your love)
[Outro]
I'm tired of being alone, bye
Still in love with you, now
Let's stay together, together
