[Verse 1]
The day the world gets 'round
To understanding where it is
Using all it's found
To help each other, hand in hand
[Verse 2]
The day the world gets 'round
To understanding where it's gone
Losing so much ground
Killing each other, hand in hand
Such foolishness in man
I want no part of their plan, no
[Bridge]
You're the destructive kind
Now I'm working from day to day
As I don't want to be like you
A love with a pure heart
And the ones who have made a start
But Lord, there are just a few
Who bow before you in silence they pray
Oh how they pray for
[Verse 3]
The day the world gets 'round
Using all they've found
To help each other, hand in hand[Outro]
The day the world gets 'round
