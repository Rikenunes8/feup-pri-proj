[Verse 1]
Made the fatal mistake
Like I did once before
Tendency just to take
Till the purpose turned sour
[Chorus 1]
Strain, take the strain
These days we love
Strain, take the strain
These days we love
[Verse 2]
Yeah, the only mistake
Was that you ran away
Avenues lined with trees
Strangled words for the day
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the only mistake
Like I made once before
Yeah, the only mistake
Could have made it before
[Chorus 1]
Strain, take the strain
These days we love
Strain, take the strain
These days we love[Verse 3]
And the only mistake
Led to rumors unfound
Led to pressures unknown
Different feelings and sounds
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the only mistake
Like I made once before
Yeah, the only mistake
Could have made it before
