Soak me to my skin
Will you drown me in your sweet submission
Ends and I begin
Choke me, smoke the air
In this citrus-sucking sunshine, I don't care
You're not all there
Every backbone and heart you break
We'll still come back for more
Submission ends it all
Here he come, got no question, got no love
I'm throwing stones at you, man
I want you black and blue and
I'm gonna make you bleed
Gonna bring you down to your knees
Bye bye badman, ooh bye bye
Choke me, smoke the air
In this citrus-sucking sunshine I don't
Care you're not all there
You've been bought and paid, you're a whore, a slave
Your dock's not a holy shrine
Come taste the end, you're mine
Here he come, got no question got no love
I'm throwing stones at you, man
I want you black and blue and
I'm gonna make you bleed
Gonna bring you down to your knees
Bye bye badman ooh bye bye
I've got bad intentions, I intend to knock you down
These stones I throw, Oh these French kisses
Are the only way I've found...
I've got bad intentions, I intend to knock you down
These stones I throw, Oh these French kisses
Are the only way I've found...
