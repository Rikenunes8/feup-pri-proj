[Chorus]
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
[Verse 1]
When you look in the mirror
Do you see yourself
Do you see yourself
On the T.V. screen
Do you see yourself in the magazine
When you see yourself
Does it make you scream
[Chorus]
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
[Chorus]
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
[Verse 2]
When you look in the mirror
Do you smash it quick
Do you take the glass
And slash your wrists
Did you do it for fame
Did you do it in a fit
Did you do it before
You read about it
[Chorus]
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
