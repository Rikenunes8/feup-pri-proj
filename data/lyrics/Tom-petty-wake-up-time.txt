[Verse 1]
You follow your feelings, you follow your dreams
You follow the leader into the trees
And what's in there waiting, neither one of us knows
You gotta keep one eye open, the further you go
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You never dreamed you'd go down on one knee, but now
Who could've seen you'd be so hard to please somehow?
You feel like a poor boy a long way from home
You're just a poor boy a long way from home
[Chorus]
And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise and shine
[Verse 2]
You spend your life dreaming, running 'round in a trance
You hang out forever and still miss the dance
And if you get lucky, you might find someone
To help you get over the pain that will come
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah, you were so cool back in high school, what happened?
You were so sure not to have your spirits down
But you're just a poor boy, alone in this world
You're just a poor boy, alone in this world
[Chorus]
And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise and shine
[Verse 3]
Well, they think it's lucky, a boy finds a girl
To help him to shoulder the pain in this world
And if you follow your feelings, you follow your dreams
You might find the forest there in the trees[Pre-Chorus 3]
Yeah, you'll be all right, it's just gonna take time, and now
Who could have seen you'd be so hard to please somehow?
You're just a poor boy, a long way from home
You're just a poor boy, a long way from home
[Chorus]
And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise and shine
[Chorus]
'Cause it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise and shine
