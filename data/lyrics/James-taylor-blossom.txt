[Verse 1]
Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way
Lately I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen
Melt my cares away
[Chorus]
Send the sunshine down my way
Whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me
Girl, it's all the same
[Verse 2]
Blossom, there's an empty road behind
Sit you down beside me
Blossom, there's a sweet dream on my mind
There's a song inside me
Take these chains away
[Chorus]
Now send the sunshine down my way
Whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me
Girl, it's all the same[Verse 1]
Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way
Lately I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen
Melt my cares away
[Outro]
