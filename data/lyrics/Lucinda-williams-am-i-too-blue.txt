[Chorus]
Am I too blue for you?
Am I too blue?
When I cry like the sky
Like the sky sometimes
Am I too blue?
[Verse 1]
Is the night too black?
Is the wind too rough?
Is it at your back?
Have you had enough?
[Verse 2]
Do you miss my touch?
Do you wanna stay?
Do you have so much
Still left to say?
[Chorus]
Am I too blue for you?
Am I too blue?
When I cry like the sky
Like the sky sometimes
Am I too blue?[Verse 3]
When you're in the dark
Do you call my name?
Is there still a spark?
Does it feel the same?
[Verse 4]
The sun beats down
It burns your skin
When you run into
My arms again
[Chorus]
Am I too blue for you?
Am I too blue?
When I cry like the sky
Like the sky sometimes
Am I too blue?
Am I too blue for you?
Am I too blue?
When I cry like the sky
Like the sky sometimes
Am I too blue?
