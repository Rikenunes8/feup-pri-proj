Wild and free
Is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for the steeple
Power to the people
Setting down the old crew
Bringing in the brand new
Wild and free
With peace finally
Wild and free
Is the way I want my life
Nature's way for me
Without pain and strife
Fighting what is wrong
Across the world as well as home
But respect for everybody's right
Could be really out of sight
Our great obligations
Would not be mad situations
If the young would be listened to
For what they really know is true
Respect for the steeple
Power to the people
The old people who worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm so wild and free
Wild and free
Is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for the steeple
Power to the people
Setting down the old crew
