[Verse]
While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn
[Pre-Chorus]
The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love
In a ball of yarn
[Chorus]
He'll never return it
So, when you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
So, when you come back
We'll have to make new love
[Verse]
While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn
[Pre-Chorus]
The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love, our love
In a ball of yarn
[Chorus]
He'll never return it
So, when you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
So, when you come back
We'll have to make new love[Chorus]
He'll never return it
So, when you come back
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
So, when you come back
We'll have to make new love
