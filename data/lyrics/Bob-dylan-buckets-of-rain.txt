[Verse 1]
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin’ out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love
Honey, baby, I can stand
[Verse 2]
I been meek
And hard like an oak
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me
Honey, baby, I’ll be here
[Verse 3]
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery
[Verse 4]
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain’t no monkey, but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I’m taking you with me
Honey, baby, when I go
[Verse 5]
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do, and you do it well
I do it for you
Honey, baby, can’t you tell?
