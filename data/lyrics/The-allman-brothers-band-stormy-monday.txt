They call it Stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
They call it Stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
Lord, and Wednesday's worse
And Thursday's also sad
The eagle flies on Friday
Saturday I go out to play
The eagle flies on Friday
Saturday I go out to play
Sunday I go to church
Gonna kneel down and pray
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Though I'm tryin' and tryin' to find my baby
Won't somebody please send her home to me
