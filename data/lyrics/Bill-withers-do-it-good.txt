[Intro]
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
[Verse 1]
If you want to kiss a funky beagle
Hitch a ride upon an eagle
Read a catalog from Spiegel
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Hey, do it, do it to it
But do it good
[Bridge]
If you read the album cover by now
You know that my name is what my name is
When I came in here to try and
Do this, something I've never done before
Mr. Jones, Booker T., said to me
Don't worry about it
Just do what you do
And do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
[Verse 2]
Ah, fish was made for hookin'
And grits was made for cookin'
And eyes were made for lookin'
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Go on and do it, do it, do it
Hey, do it, do it to it
But do it good
[Outro]
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
Do it good, do it good
