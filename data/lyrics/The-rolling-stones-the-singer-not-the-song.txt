[Verse 1]
Everywhere you want, I always go
I always give in because, baby, you know
You just say so because you give me
[Chorus]
That feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
[Verse 2]
It's not the way you give in willingly
Others do it without thrilling me
Giving me that same old
[Chorus]
Feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
The same old places and the same old songs
We've been going there for much too long
There's something wrong and it gives me that
[Chorus]
Feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
[Outro]
It's the singer not the song
It's the singer not the song
