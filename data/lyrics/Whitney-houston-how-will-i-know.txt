[Verse 1]
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
[Verse 2]
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistakin'
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me
[Pre-Chorus]
How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?[Bridge]
If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?
[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
[Outro]
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know? Ooh
How will I know? (I fall in love)
How will I know?
How will I know?
I'm asking you
