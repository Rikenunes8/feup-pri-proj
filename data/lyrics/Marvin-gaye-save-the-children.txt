[Verse 1]
I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares, to save a world in despair?
Who really cares? (Ohhh)
There'll come a time (There'll come a time)
When the world won't be singing (When the world won't be singing)
Flowers won't grow (Flowers won't grow, no)
Bells won't be ringin' (The bells won't be ringin')
Who really cares? (Who really cares?)
Who's willing to try? (Who is willin' to try?)
To save the world (To save the world)
That's destined to die (That is destined to die)
When I look at the world (When I look at the world)
It fills me with sorrow (It fills me with sorrow)
Little children today (Children today)
Are really gonna suffer tomorrow (Really suffer tomorrow)
(Oh!) What a shame (What a shame)
Such a bad way to live (Such a bad way to live)
Oh, who is to blame? (Who is to blame?)
We can't stop living (When we can't stop living)
(Ohhh!) Live, (Live)
(Live for life) Live for life
(But let live everybody)
Live life for the children (Live life for the children!)
(Oh, for the Children!)
You see, let's... (Oh!) let's save the children (Oh)
Let's...let's save all the children
(Save the babies! Save the babies!)
(And if you want to love, you got to save the babies!)
(Oh you've got the feeling, you've got the feeling)
(You will save the babies! All of the children!)[Verse 2]
But who really cares?
Who's willing to try? Yeah
To save our world, yeah
To save our sweet world
To save a world that is destined to die
