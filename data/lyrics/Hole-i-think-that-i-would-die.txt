[Verse 1]
He's stupid
I'm smarting
He's stupid
I'm smarting
[Chorus]
I want my baby
Where is the baby?
I want my baby
Who took my baby?
[Interlude]
Rose white, rose red
Rose up in my head
Rose white, rose red
[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I want some
Yeah, yeah
There is none
[Chorus]
I want my baby
Where is the baby?
I want my baby
There is a baby
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
[Interlude]
Rose white, rose red
Rose up in my head
Rose white, rose red
Oh! No![Bridge]
She lost all her innocence
Gave it to an abscess
She lost all her innocence
She said, "I am not a feminist"
It's not yours
Fuck you!
[Outro]
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
