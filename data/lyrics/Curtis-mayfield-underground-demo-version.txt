[Verse 1]
Familiar music, familiar sound
There's mutual thoughts for the underground
Long-range sight for an eternal night
Future prophecy for the mass you see
There'll be equal stay and equal play
The underground where none can betray
[Chorus]
The underground
The underground
Underground
[Verse 2]
We'll all turn black, so who's to know
As a matter of fact, color, creed and breed must go
There will be no light so there can be no sight
And you'll judge your fellow man, understand, by what is right
[Outro]
Familiar music, familiar sound
There's mutual thoughts for the underground
The underground
The underground
The underground
Underground
