[Verse]
Now it's time
To say goodnight to you
Now it's time
To bid you sweet adieu
[Bridge]
And maybe, drink a cheers to yesterday
And maybe, you'll drink those tears away
[Chorus]
So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight
Tonight
