Frightened faces to the wall
Oh, can't you hear your mama call?
The brave and strong survive
When you walk
Know where you're walking
When you talk
Brave and strong survive!
Out and down
Ain't got a friend
You don't know who turned you in
The brave and strong survive
The brave and strong survive
Before me was a cowboy star
Indians!
And there you are
The brave and strong survive
The brave and strong survive, child
