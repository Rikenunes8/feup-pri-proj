[Verse 1]
I had a little corn
I put it in a sack
I get to the mill
And had to bring it right back
[Chorus]
What's the matter with the mill
Done broke down
What's the matter with this mill
Done broke down
I can't get no grinding
Tell me what's the matter with the mill
[Verse 2]
Some people said that a preacher won't steal
I caught one down in my corn field
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
One had a bush and one had a peck
The other had the cornfield round his neck
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Done broke down[x2]
[Verse 4]
You don't know the way I feel
I got some more weevil in my corn field
[Chorus]
