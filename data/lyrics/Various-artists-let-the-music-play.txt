[Verse 1]
When you're feeling sad and lonely
And you're tired too
Don't believe a word they tell you
'Cause it's never true
I don't know what brought you there
But I know what to do
[Chorus]
You got to let the music play
We can dance all day
On into the night, day is done
Waiting for the sun to rise
[Verse 2]
If you're troubled, too much worries
Life has got you down
All you see is pain and sorrow
When you look around
I don't know how you can take it
Get up off the ground
[Chorus]
You can let the music play
We can dance all day
On into the night, day is done
Waiting for the sun to rise
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
Let the music play
We can dance all day
On into the night, day is done
Waiting for the sun to rise
[Verse 3]
When your luck is running out
You feel you don't belong
Everything you try to do
Just seems to come out wrong
I don't wanna push you but you know you can't go on
Oh, oh[Outro]
Let the music play
We can dance all day
On into the night
Day, day is done
Wait for the sun to rise
Wait for the sun to rise
Let the music play, let it play, let it play
Let it play, let it play, let it play, let it play, let it play, let it play
Oh, oh, let the music play, oh, oh
