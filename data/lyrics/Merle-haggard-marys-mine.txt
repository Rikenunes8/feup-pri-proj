[Chorus]
Mary's mine and she'll always be
Till the end of time, she gave her heart to me
No truer love could I ever find
Than Mary's love and Mary's mine
[Verse]
I once lived the life without meaning
Just a face with no place in this world
At last, I found a reason for living
And I owe it all to the love of a girl
[Verse]
Her love gave me reason for living
To make her happy is first on my mind
Because of her, my life has real meaning
I love her so and I know Mary's mine
[Chorus]
Mary's mine and she'll always be
Till the end of time, she gave her heart to me
No truer love could I ever find
Than Mary's love and Mary's mine
