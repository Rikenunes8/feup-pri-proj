I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins

Lack of iron and/or sleeping
[Verse 2]
I own my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit is her milk
[Chorus]

Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

[Post-Chorus]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
