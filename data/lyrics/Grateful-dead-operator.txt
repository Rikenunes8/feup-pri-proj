Operator, can you help me
Help me if you please
Give me the right area code
And the number that I need
My rider left upon the midnight flyer
Singing like a summer breeze
I think she's somewhere down South
Down about Baton Rouge
But I just can't remember no number
A number I can use
Directory don't have it, central done forgot it
I've gotta find a number to use
Trying to check out her number
Trying to run down her line
Operator said that's privileged information
And it ain't no business of mine
It's flooding down in Texas, the poles are out in Utah
Got to find a private line
She could be hanging round the steel mill
Working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland
Talking to the night
I don't know where she's going, I don't care where she's been
Long as she's been doing it right
Long as she's been doing it right
