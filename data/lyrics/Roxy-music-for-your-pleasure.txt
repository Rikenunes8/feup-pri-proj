For your pleasure in our present state
Part false, part true, like anything
We present ourselves
The words we use tumble
All over your shoulder
Gravel hard and loose
There all night lying
With your dark horse hiding
Abhorring such extremes
You're rubbing shoulders
With the stars at night, shining so bright
Getting older
But you'll wake up soon and fight
In the morning
Things you worried about last night
Will seem lighter
I hope things will turn out right
Old man
Through every step, a change
You watch me walk away
