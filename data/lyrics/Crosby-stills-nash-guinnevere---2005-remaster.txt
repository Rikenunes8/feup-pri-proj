Guinnevere had green eyes
Like yours, m'lady, like yours
She'd walk down through the garden
In the morning after it rained
Peacocks wandered aimlessly
Underneath an orange tree
Why can't she see me?

Guinnevere drew pentagrams
Like yours, m'lady, like yours
Late at night when she thought
That no one was watching at all
On the wall
She shall be free
As she turns her gaze
Down the slope to the harbor where I lay
Anchored for a day

Guinnevere had golden hair
Like yours, m'lady, like yours
Streaming out when we'd ride
Through the warm wind down by the bay
Yesterday
Seagulls circle endlessly
I sing in silent harmony
We shall be free
