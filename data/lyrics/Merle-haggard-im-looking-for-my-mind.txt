I lost my mind the day I lost your love
I lost everything except the will to cry
If you find me crawling back from time to time
It's not you I want, I'm lookin' for my mind
'Cause I lost my mind the day I lost your love
I'm not crazy but sometimes I wish I was
If you turn around and find me crawling close behind
It's not you I want, I'm lookin' for my mind
'Cause I lost my mind the day I lost your love
I'm not crazy but sometimes I wish I was
If you turn around and find me crawling close behind
It's not you I want, I'm lookin' for my mind
It's not you I want, I'm lookin' for my mind
