Driving in my big black car
Nothing can go wrong
I'm going and I don't know how far
So, so long
Maybe I'll sleep in a Holiday Inn
[Chorus]
Nothing can hurt me
Nothing can touch me
Why should I care?
Driving's a gas
It ain't gonna last
Sunny day, highway
If it rains it's all the same
I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing
I've got a big black car
[Chorus]
The lights above, oh yes
I see the stars above
