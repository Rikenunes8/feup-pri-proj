[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew
[Verse 1]
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our lips
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our hips
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do?
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew
[Verse 2]
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our eyes
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our thighs
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do?
[Bridge]
And I would have to pinch her
Just to see if she was real
Just to watch the smile fade away
See the pain she'd feel
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew[Verse 3]
Wanted to feel her joy
Feel it deep within
Wanted to feel her joy
Penetrate my skin
[Chorus]
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do?
[Outro]
Why do you smile the smile you do?
Why do you smile the smile you do?
Why do you smile the smile you do?
Why do you smile the smile you do?
Why do you smile the smile you do?
