[Verse 1]
Hello Morning
Good, good morning to the one I love
Crystal Ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above
[Chorus]
Little girl, you're sad
Though all you have is visible to you
Within your heart, there stays a part
That like the sky is blue
[Verse 2]
Shifting breezes, grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance
[Chorus]
Little girl, it seems
In all my dreams
Your happiness is due
But still they last
There in your past
Events that make you blue
[Bridge]
Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try
[Verse 3]
In an instant, there'll be sunshine
Sprinkled every place
Drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face
[Chorus]
Little girl, be fair
Show yourself you care
Let others care for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
'Til your heart's no longer blue[Harmonica solo]
[Chorus]
Little girl, be smart
Don't break your own heart
There is love waiting for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
'Til your heart's no longer blue
