[Verse 1]
This is my same old coat
These are my same old shoes
It was the same old me
With the same old blues
Oh, then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
When I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl, ah, man
[Chorus]
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you, whoa, oh, oh
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you
[Verse 2]
I got the same old friends
And they've got the same old sins
I tell them the same old jokes
And I get the same old grins
But now the joke is on you
It happened somehow with you
Every day of my life
I'm as fresh as morning dew
[Chorus]
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you, oh-oh, oh-oh
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you
[Verse 3]
I go to the same old places (Same old)
I see the same old faces
I look at the same old sky (Same old)
See it all in a brand new light
I got a brand new boy (Brand new)
And I got me a brand new smile
Since I found you, baby (I'm slippin')
I got me a brand new style[Chorus]
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you, oh, I feel good
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you, oh, I feel good
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Hey, just because of you, yes I do
Just because of you, boy (Just because of you, boy)
Just because of you, oh, I feel good
[Post-Chorus]
Just because of you, boy, yeah
Just because of you
Just because of you, boy
Just because, because, because of you
[Outro]
Just because of you, boy, ooh, boy
Just because of you, boy, ooh, boy
Just because of you, boy, ooh, boy
Just because of you
