[Verse 1]
Couple in the next room bound to win a prize
They've been going at it all night long
Well, I'm trying to get some sleep
But these motel walls are cheap
Lincoln Duncan is my name, and here's my song
Here's my song
[Verse 2]
My father was a fisherman
My mama was the fisherman's friend
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder
So when I reached my prime, I left my home in the Maritimes
Headed down the turnpike for New England
Sweet New England
[Verse 3]
Holes in my confidence
Holes in the knees of my jeans
I was left without a penny in my pocket
Ooh-oowee, I was about destituted as a kid could be
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it
I'd like to hock it
[Verse 4]
A young girl in a parking lot was preaching to a crowd
Singing sacred songs and reading from the Bible
Well, I told her I was lost
And she told me all about the 
Pentecost
And I seen that girl as the road to my survival
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
[Verse 5]
Just later on the very same night
When I crept to her tent with a flashlight
And my long years of innocence ended
Well, she took me to the woods
Saying here comes something and it feels so good
And just like a dog, I was befriended
I was befriended[Verse 6]
Oh, oh, what a night
Oh what a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was playing my guitar 
lying underneath the stars
Just thanking the Lord for my fingers
For my fingers
[Outro]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
