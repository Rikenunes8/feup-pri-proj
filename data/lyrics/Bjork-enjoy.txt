[Verse 1]
I wish I want to stay here
I wish this be enough
I wish I only love you
I wish simplicity
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Look at the speed out there
It magnetizes me to it
And I have no fear
I'm only into this to
[Chorus]
Enjoy
Enjoy
Enjoy
Enjoy
[Verse 2]
I wish I'd only look
And didn't have to touch
I wish I'd only smell this
And didn't have to taste
[Pre-Chorus 2]
How can I ignore?
This is sex without touching
I'm going to explore
I'm only into this to
[Chorus]
Enjoy
Enjoy
Enjoy
