[Verse 1]
Drive yourself right up the wall
No one hears and no one calls
It's a boring state
It's a useless wait, I know
Brag about things you don't understand
A girl and a woman, a boy and a man
Everything's sexually vague
Now you're wondering to yourself if you might be gay
[Chorus]
Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
One day, baby, maybe help you through
[Verse 2]
Drive your ma to the bank
Tell your pa you got a date
But you're lying
Now you're lying on your back
Trying to figure out, they wonder what next you'll pull
You don't understand anything sexual
I don't understand
Tell my friends I'm doing fine
[Chorus]
And your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny, you ain't laughing, are you?
Sixteen blue
Sixteen
Sixteen
[Chorus]
Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny, you ain't laughing, are you?
Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue
You're mine, if you want to
