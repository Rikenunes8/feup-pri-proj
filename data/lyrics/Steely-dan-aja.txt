[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Up on the hill,
 
people never stare
They just don't care
[Chorus]
Chinese music
 
under banyan trees
Here at the dude ranch above the sea
Aja, 
when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
[Verse 2]
Up on the hill, they've got time to burn
There's no return
[Chorus]
Double helix in the sky tonight
Throw out the hardware, let's do it right
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Up on the hill, they think I'm okay
Or so they say
[Chorus]
Chinese music always sets me free
Angular banjos sound good to me
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
[Instrumental Outro]
