[Verse 1]
The summer had inhaled and held its breath too long
The winter looked the same as if it never had gone
And through an open window where no curtain hung
I saw you
I saw you
Comin' back to me
[Verse 2]
One begins to read between the pages of a look
The shape of sleepy music and suddenly you're hooked
Through the rain upon the trees that kisses on the run
I saw you
I saw you
Comin' back to me
[Bridge]
You came to stay and live my way
Scatter my love like leaves in the wind
You always say you won't go away
But I know what it always has been
It always has been
[Verse 3]
A transparent dream beneath an occasional sigh
Most of the time I just let it go by
Now I wish it hadn't begun
I saw you
Yes I saw you
Comin' back to me
[Verse 4]
Strolling the hills overlooking the shore
I realize I've been here before
The shadow in the mist could have been anyone
I saw you
I saw you
Comin' back to me
[Verse 5]
Small things like reasons are put in a jar
Whatever happened to wishes, wished on a star?
Was it just something that I made up for fun?
I saw you
I saw you
Comin' back to me
