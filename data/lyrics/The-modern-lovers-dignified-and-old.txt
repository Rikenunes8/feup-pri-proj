My telephone never rings
She'd never call me
I hate myself today
But I can see through this bitterness and sadness
And so I won't die
Someday I think I'll be dignified and old
Well my friends say that I deceive myself
And that I contradict myself
And I can't say if they're right
But I'm not ashamed
Oh I can take a challenge
And so I won't die
Someday I'll be dignified and old
I know it
And I say hey kids
(Hey kids)
I said hey kids
(Hey kids)
I say someday we'll be dignified and old
That's right
I said some day we'll be dignified
(Hey kids, Hey kids)
Someday we'll be dignified
(Hey kids, Hey kids)
Someday we could be dignified and old together
Well now
Look at the mountain
My girl and I used to stand on the mountain
And the sun shines, she's dead, and I cry
But I can see through this death and the sadness
And so I won't die now
Someday I wanna be dignified and old
Well now, see the desert
I sit all alone in the desert
And no girl understands me
But I can see through this bleakness and grey and sadness
And well I won't die now
Someday I'll be dignified and old
I say, you, don't die now
Someday we'll be dignified and old together
