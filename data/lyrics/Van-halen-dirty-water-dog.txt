[Verse 1]
No candidate would I support
His platform could I endorse
Another accomplice slinging dirt
Campaign promises falling short
[Verse 2]
I don't belong to any race
Pledge allegiance to a place
No borderline in the sand I'd trace
I'm just a sucker for a pretty face
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Uncomfortable in the realm of the political
Position's always been a little left of cynical
I'm fundamentally for the individual
Preoccupied purely with the physical
[Chorus 1]
When heavy is the weight of the world
And the river runs a little too deep
Like a hound dog chasing a bird
Sometimes a certain Tom's gotta peep
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna find religion
Or another man's opinion
I can't choose what's not my decision
When there's only one under the sun
[Verse 4]
There's no need to be denied
Chew before swallowing pride
I want to live so let me die
Oh by the way, what's your sign?[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can't comprehend the meaning of the metaphysical
I'd rather leave that to your so-called intellectual
But what I do know I know feels only natural
I'm just a red-blooded heterosexual
[Chorus 2]
When heavy is the weight of the world
And the river runs a little too deep
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
When heavy is the weight of the world
And the river runs a little too deep
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls
And I think I like, like a hound dog, chasin' a bird
[Outro]
And I think I like
A dirty water dog
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see
