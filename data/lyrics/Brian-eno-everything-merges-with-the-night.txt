[Verse 1]
Rosalie, I've been waiting all evening
Possibly years I don't know
Counting the passing hours
Everything merges with the night
[Verse 2]
I stand on the beach
Giving out descriptions
Different for everyone I see
Since I just can't remember
Longer than last September
[Verse 3]
Santiago under the volcano
Floats like a cushion on the sea
Yet I can never sleep here
Everything ponders in the night
[Verse 4]
Rosalie, we've been talking all summer
Picking the straw from our clothes
See how the breeze has softened
Everything pauses in the night
