[Verse]
Willie and Lillie used to live on a hill
Wasn't for rock and roll, Lillie be there still
Rock her own little rock-a-billys
Made me lose a-my sweet, little, Lillie
Forty days, forty nights
Still no Lillie in sight
Up on the mountain like a jack
Holling an howling until Lillie, come back
Up on the mountain I was facing the moon
Every little star tell me be Lillie, soon
Up on the mountain at the general store
Willie's mama bought him a hi-fi, his very own
On up the road, Willie strolled
Just about the time Lillie knocked on the door
She said, "Hello, Willy I love you so"
He said, "Hello, Lillie why did you go?"
She said, "A-hello, Willie I am not going to leave no more"
He said, "Hello, Lillie I love you, so"
"Hello, Willie, I love you, so"
He said, "A-hello Lillie"
