[Verse 1]
I got a mean red spider
And she been webbing all over town
I got a mean red spider
And she been webbing all over town
I'm going to get me a mean black spider
So I can tear her cobweb down
[Verse 2]
I got a break coming
No need for me to moan
I got a break is sure coming
No need for me to moan
That's just a mean red spider
She's breaking up my happy home
All right stop this stuff man
Go ahead man
If I don't go crazy
I will surely lose my mind
Well you know if I don't go crazy
I will surely lose my mind
That's just a mean red spider
And she just bother me all the time
