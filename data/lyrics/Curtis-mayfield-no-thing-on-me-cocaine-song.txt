[Intro]
I've met many people over the years
And in my opinion I have found that
People are the same everywhere
They have the same fears
Shed similar tears
Die in so many years
The oppressed seem to have suffered the most
In every continent - coast to coast
Now our lives are in the hands of The Pusherman
We break it all down
In hopes that you might understand how to protect yourself
Don't make no profit for The Man
[Chorus]
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
[Verse 1]
There's somethin' kinda funny
How The Man take your money
He's shrewd as he can be
In such a way you'll never see
It's a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
The weaker turn to dope
And put all aside their hope
[Chorus]
And I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me[Verse 2]
Twinkling twinkling grains
They do all sorts of things
While your inner mind is pleased
Your conscience is only teased...
[Verse 3]
More and more you feed
Until you grow another need
Playing fantasy
You have no reality
[Chorus]
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
[Verse 4]
Sit down and take a listen
This may be something that you're missin'
I know your mind, you want it funky
But you don't have to be no junkie[Chorus]
Just be glad you've got your own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The Man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
[Outro]
Sure is funky
Sure is funky
I ain't no junkie
I ain't no junkie
Sure is funky
Sure is funky
I ain't no junkie
I ain't no junkie
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see...
