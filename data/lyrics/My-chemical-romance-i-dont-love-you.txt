[Verse 1]
Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way
[Pre-Chorus]
And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can
[Chorus]
When you go, and would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you oughta stay
[Pre-Chorus]
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa
[Chorus]
When you go, and would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?
[Post-Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
When you go, would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you like I loved you yesterday"?[Outro]
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
