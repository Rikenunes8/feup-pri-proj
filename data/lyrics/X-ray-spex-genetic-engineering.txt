Genetic engineering
Could create the perfect race
Could create an unknown life-force
That could us exterminate
Introducing worker clone
As our subordinated slave
His expertise proficiency
Will surely dig our grave
It's so very tempting
Will biologists resist?
When he becomes the creator?
Will he let us exist?
Bionic man is jumping
Through the television set
He's about to materialise
And guess who's coming next
Genetic engineering
Could create the perfect race
Could create an unknown life-force

It's so very tempting
Will biologists resist?
When he becomes the creator?
Will he let us exist?
It's so very tempting
