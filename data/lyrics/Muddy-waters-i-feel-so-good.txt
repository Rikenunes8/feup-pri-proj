[Verse 1]
I got a letter
It came to me by mail
My baby's coming home
I hope that she don't fail
[Chorus]
You know I feel so good
Well, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like balling the jack
[Verse 2]
I feel so good
I hope I always will
I feel like a Jack out with a Jenny
Well behind the hill
[Chorus]
You know I feel so good
Yeah, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like balling the jack
[Verse 3]
I'm goin' down to the station
Catch me a train
See my baby
You know I got delayed
[Chorus]
You know I feel so good
Well yes, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like balling the jack
[Verse 4]
I love my tea
Crazy about my garden gin
When I get high
I feel like blowin' around in the wind[Chorus]
You know I feel so good
Well yes, I feel so good
You know I feel so good
I feel like balling the jack
