When it happened
Something snapped inside
Made me want to hide
All alone on my own
All alone on my own
I stood up on the stand
With my eyes shut tight
Didn't want to see anybody
Feeling happy
Having a good time, now hey
Doing alright doing alright
Doing alright doing alright
Looked hard into the dancing crowd
Felt like screaming out loud
I saw you standing in there
I saw your long
Saw your long hair
Opened up my eyes, baby
You made me
Realize all I want to do
All I want to do now, girl
Is look at you looking at you baby
Look at you, looking at you baby
Yeah, yeah, hey
Looked hard into the dancing crowd
I felt like screaming out loud
All I wanna do all I wanna do
All I want to do
Is look at you looking at you, baby
Look at you, looking at you baby
Looking at you looking
At you looking at you, baby
You baby you baby you baby, yeah
