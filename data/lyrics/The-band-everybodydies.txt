Woke up twenty-five years late to the party
I don't wanna live in my head any more
So sick and tired of sayin' I'm sorry
When I don't even know what I keep sayin' it for

'Cause I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't
Damned if I win, damned if I choke
Blame it on me, blame it on God
Don't wanna be somethin' I'm not

You can't make me stop
You can't make me stay
I don't know how many more I've got
But I'll be waitin' for forever if I'm waitin' for a better day
You can't make me go
You can't make me change
I don't know what the future holds
But it happens how it happens, everybody dies anyway

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Used to feel so cold, I was stuck in the static
If we're all born dyin', what's the point of it all?
But if the song never stopped, it wouldn't have any magic
So even though it's gotta end, I'll keep singin' along

'Cause I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't
Damned if I win, damned if I choke
Blame it on me, blame it on God
Don't wanna be somethin' I'm not

You can't make me stop
You can't make me stay
I don't know how many more I've got
But I'll be waitin' for forever if I'm waitin' for a better day
You can't make me go
You can't make me change
I don't know what the future holds
But it happens how it happens, everybody dies anyway

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Everybody dies anyway
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Damned if I do, damned if I don't (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Damned if I win, damned if I choke

You can't make me stop
You can't make me stay
I don't know how many more I've got
But I'll be waitin' for forever if I'm waitin' for a better day
You can't make me go
You can't make me change
I don't know what the future holds
But it happens how it happens, everybody dies anyway

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Everybody dies anyway
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I don't know what the future holds
But it happens how it happens, everybody dies anyway
