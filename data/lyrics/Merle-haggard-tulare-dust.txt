[Verse]
Tulare dust in a farmboy's nose
Wondering where the freight train goes
Standing in a field by the railroad track
Cursing this strap on my cotton sack
[Verse]
I can see Mom and Dad with shoulders low
Both of 'em picking on a double row
They do it for a living because they must
That's life like it is in the Tulare dust
[Verse]
The California sun was something new
That winter we arrived in '42
And I can still remember how my Daddy cussed
The tumbleweeds here in the Tulare dust
[Verse]
The valley fever was a coming fate
To the farm workers here in the Golden State
And I miss Oklahoma, but I'll stay if I must
And help make a living in the Tulare dust
[Verse]
The Tulare dust in a farmboy's nose
Wondering where the freight train goes
Standing in a cotton field with a railroad track
Cursing the strap on my cotton sack
I see Mom and Dad with shoulders low
