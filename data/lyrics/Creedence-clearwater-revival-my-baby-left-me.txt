[Verse 1]
Yes, my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done, something that she heard?
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, never said a word
[Verse 2]
But I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me and never said goodbye
Help, little boy
[Verse 3]
Well now, one of these mornings, Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and, baby, Daddy will I know
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me and never said a word
[Verse 4]
Lord, I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan
All I know is that is one I love is gone
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me and never said goodbye
[Outro]
My baby even left me, never said goodbye
