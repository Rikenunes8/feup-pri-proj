[Intro]
Baby, baby, baby
[Verse 1]
So you think you got an evil mind?
Well, I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time
Well, it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore, oh no
[Chorus]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
At your door
[Verse 2]
So you think I got a funny face
Well, I ain't no worry
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Say I'm a dog and God it's no disgrace
And I ain't no hurry
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore, oh no
[Chorus]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
At your door
[Verse 3]
So you think we have a lazy time
Well you should know better
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
And you say I got a dirty mind
Well, I'm a mean go-getter
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
Anymore, oh no
[Chorus]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
At your door
[Chorus]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
[Outro]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
