Cherish is a word I say to describe
All the feelings I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I wish that I had told you
You don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I wish that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish as much as I cherish you
Cherish is a word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
And I'm not going to be the one to share your dreams
And I'm not going to be the one to share your schemes
And I'm not going to be the one to share
What seems to be the life that you would cherish as much as I cherish you
Oh I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That the right amount of letters and just the right sound
That could make you hear and make you see
That you are driving me out of my mind
Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize
That I want you, just like a thousand other guys
Who say they like you
Like all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hand
And gaze into your eyesCherish is a word I say to describe
All the feelings I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I wish that I had told you
You don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I wish that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you
And I do cherish you, cherish is the word
