[Verse 1]
I'm going to say something to you
I don't care how you feel
You just don't realize
You got yourself a good deal
[Chorus]
She's nineteen years old
And got ways just like a baby child
Nothing I can do to please her
To make this young woman feel satisfied
[Verse 2]
I'm going to say this to you
I don't care if you get mad
You about the prettiest little girl
That I ever had
[Chorus]
She's nineteen years old
And got ways just like a baby child
Nothing I can do to please her
To make this young woman feel satisfied
(What kind of woman is that?)
[Verse 3]
Can't ask her where she's going
She tells me where she's been
She starts a conversation
That don't have no end
[Chorus]
She's nineteen years old
And got ways just like a baby child
Nothing I can do to please her
[Outro]
Whoah, yeah![x3]
To make this young woman feel satisfied
