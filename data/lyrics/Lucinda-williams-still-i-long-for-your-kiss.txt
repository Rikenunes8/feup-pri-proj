[Verse 1]
I know I shouldn't but I want you so bad
I know it couldn't be but I want what we had
I know our love is gone and I can't bring it back
Still I long for your kiss
Still I long for your kiss
[Verse 2]
I know it's over cause you told me so
I tried to leave but I can't let you go
I can't believe you don't want me no more
Still I long for your kiss
Still I long for your kiss
[Chorus]
The days go by, but they don't seem the same
I cry and cry and I call out your name
[Verse 3]
I go downtown I see your face
Nobody around can take your place
But you put me down
And you turned me away
Still I long for your kiss
Still I long for your kiss
[Chorus]
The days go by, but they don't seem the same
I cry and cry and I call out your name
[Verse 4]
I go downtown I see your face
Nobody around can take your place
But you put me down
And you turned me away
Still I long for your kiss
Still I long for your kiss
Still I long for your kiss
