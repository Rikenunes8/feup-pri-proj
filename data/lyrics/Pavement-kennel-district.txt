[Verse 1]
Hold on tight she wears the seek
It's got more stars than the sky
It's still forbidden to excuse
That little look in your eye
I was busted in my gut that time
That time I said "I know it's true"
[Chorus]
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I?
[Verse 2]
I can't believe she's married to rope
I would have turned down the light
But she always marked my fear
Doesn't make it alright
I wanted to stay there
But you know I needed you more than that
[Chorus]
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I?
[Outro]
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I ask?
Why didn't I?
