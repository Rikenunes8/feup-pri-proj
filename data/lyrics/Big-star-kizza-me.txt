[Verse 1]
Dreams and wishes, like shooting stars
Coming up rushes
I want to white out
I want to white out
[Chorus]
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you, yeah
Kizza me
Lesa, why not
[Verse 2]
Curse wild, windy linen
Warm life, so-and-so
I want to white out
I want to come on out
[Chorus]
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you, yeah
Kizza me
Lesa, why not
[Verse 1]
Dreams and wishes, like shooting stars
Coming up rushes
I want to white out
I want to white out
[Chorus]
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you deep inside
I want to feel you, yeah
Kizza me
Lesa, why notThat's enough, baby
