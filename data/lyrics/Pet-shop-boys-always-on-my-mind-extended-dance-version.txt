Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Little things I shouldve said and done, I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, Im so happy that youre mine
If I made you feel second best, Im so sorry, I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
Satisfied
Little things I shouldve said and done, I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, Im so happy that youre mine
(maybe I didn't love you...)
