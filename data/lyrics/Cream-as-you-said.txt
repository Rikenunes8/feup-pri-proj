Let's go down to where it's clean
To see what time it might have been
The tides have carried off the beach
As you said
The sun is out of reach
Let's go back to where it's clean
To see what year it might have been
The roads have carried off the smiles
As you said
To judge them at the trials
So let's go back to now that's bad
To see what time we might have had
The rails have carried off the trains
As you said
I'll never come again, again, again, again
