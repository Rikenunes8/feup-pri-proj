[Verse 1: Björn & Benny, 
Agnetha & Frida
]
Do you remember the first time and all of your sweet, sweet talk?
Ain't heard it a lot since then love
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry
He leaves every morning and he hardly says goodbye
[Pre-Chorus: Björn & Benny]
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling, I know
[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
[Verse 2: Björn & Benny, 
Agnetha & Frida
]
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen
I've given you lots of presents
Now listen to that, just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel, but he's talking through his hat
[Pre-Chorus: Björn & Benny]
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling, I know
[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Patience
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Love isn't just a sensation
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
