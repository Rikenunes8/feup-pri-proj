[Intro]
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
[Verse 1 - Ali-Ollie Woodson]
Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her again and again
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
[Bridge]
Who can explain it, who can tell you why
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
[Chorus]
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
[Verse 2 - Theo Peoples]
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone
[Bridge]
Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go
Never let her go[Chorus - Ali/Theo]
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go (Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger)
Never let, never, never let her go (You can hear her laughing, calling from across the room)
Never let, never, never let her go (Who could explain it? Who can tell you why?)
Never let, never, never let her go (Fools give you reasons, wise men never try)
Never let, never, never let her go (I never know)
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go (You better run to her side, let her know that you're alive)
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
