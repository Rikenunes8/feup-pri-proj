[Verse 1]
I'm feeling down and some kind of lonely
Cause' my baby done left me here
Heart's blazing like a five alarm fire
And I don't even give a care
I feel like the world is turning on me
My dreams turning to ashes right in front of my face
And I'm getting kind of worried
And I feel so out of place
[Hook]
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
[Background] . . I feel like cryin', yeh, yeh
Maybe baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
[Verse 2]
In the morning when I've got heartache
I can't call up the doctor for help
'Cause the only person that could ever do me any good
Is stepping out with my best friend
I feel like I'm slipping deeper
Slipping deeper into myself
And I can't take it
This stuff is scaring me to death
[Hook]

Checking out the guys that are passing by

Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
