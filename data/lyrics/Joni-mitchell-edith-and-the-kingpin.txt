[Verse 1]
The big man arrives, disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive from victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening
[Chorus 1]
His eyes hold Edith, his left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire that he grips it so tight?
[Verse 2]
Edith in the ring, the passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring his renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
[Chorus 2]
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces gently to the spoon
[Verse 3]
Edith in his bed, a plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song, some mysterious song
Bars in her head 
beating frantic and snowblind
Romantic and snowblind
She says his crime belongs
[Chorus 3]
Edith and the Kingpin, each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye, they dare not look away
You know they dare not look away
