[Verse]
Well I got a feeling (I had a dream)
Things ain't goin' right (I had a dream)
Come over, baby (I had a dream)
Let me tell you about my dream last night (I had a dream)
You know I dreamed someone else (I had a dream)
Was here with you (I had a dream)
Doing all the things (I had a dream)
That I used to do (I had a dream)
Please don't let this dream come true (I had a dream)
Tell me I'm not losin' you (I had a dream)
Baby, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)
Well, well you know I came home (I had a dream)
And found you gone (I had a dream)
I never felt so (I had a dream)
So all alone (I had a dream)
Oh with your voice (I had a dream)
Ringin' in my ear (I had a dream)
I just could not hold (I had a dream)
Hold back my tears (I had a dream)
Please don't let it come true (I had a dream)
Tell me I'm not losin' you (I had a dream)
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)
Well, well, well it seems (I had a dream)
That you love me no more (I had a dream)
I never felt (I had a dream)
Felt this way before (I had a dream)
You were so cold (I had a dream)
I wonder why (I had a dream)
You didn't care (I had a dream)
How much I cried (I had a dream)
Baby, please don't let it come true (I had a dream)
Won't you say that I'm not losin' you? (I had a dream)
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)
Well, well, you know I begged you (I had a dream)
Well, come back fast (I had a dream)
You know without you, baby (I had a dream)
I know I couldn't last (I had a dream)
Oh, but you would not listen (I had a dream)
Listen to my plea (I had a dream)
You turned around (I had a dream)
And walked away from me (I had a dream)
Now you know you can't let it come true now (I had a dream)
Tell me I'm not losin' you, baby (I had a dream)
Won't you say it was a dream? (I had a dream, I had a dream)
