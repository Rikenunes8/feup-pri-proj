[Verse 1]
She looked me over
And I guess she thought I was all right
All right in a sort of a limited way
For an off-night
She said, "Don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party?"
I said, "Who am I
To blow against the wind?"
[Chorus]
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
[Verse 2]
She said, "There's something about you
That really reminds me of money"
She is the kind of a girl
That could say things that weren't that funny
I said, "What does that mean
I really remind you of money?"
She said, "Who am I
To blow against the wind?"
[Chorus]
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
[Verse 3]
She moved so easily
All I could think of was sunlight
I said, "Aren't you the woman
Who was recently given a Fulbright?"
She said, "Don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party?"
I said, "Who am I
To blow against the wind?"[Chorus]
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
[Outro]
I know what I know
I know what I know
I know what I know
I know what I know
