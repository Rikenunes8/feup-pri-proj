[Intro]
Hot thing!
[Verse 1]
Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, do you want to play with me?
[Verse 2]
Hot thing, baby you dance so good
Hot thing, baby I knew you would
Hot thing, tell me what you see
Hot thing, When you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?
[Verse 3]
Hot thing, maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're going to the Crystal Ball
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late
If you're coming home at all
Hot thing, tell them you found a brand new baby doll
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing, where we could be alone
Hot thing, I could read you poetry
And then we could make a story of our own[Interlude]
Hot thing
Hot, hot, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
[Verse 4]
Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, don't you want to play with me?
Hot thing!
Hot thing!
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing
