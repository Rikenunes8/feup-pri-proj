Passion that shouts
And red with anger
I lost myself
Through alleys of mysteries
I went up and down
Like a demented train
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Searching for something
That makes makes hearts move
I found myself
But my best possession
Walked into the shade
And threatened to drift away
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Full of myself
I left you behind
As if I could
Possessed by Quixote's dream
Went to fight dragons
In the land of concrete
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hateDon't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Rolling in pain
Discovered what hurts
And tasted hell
Infatuated by madness
I danced in flames
And drunk in the depth of love
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
