[Verse 1]
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Well, I’m standing on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the king
Well I’m driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?
[Verse 2]
Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
What good are you, anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Wedding bells are ringing, the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir's beginning to sing
What looked good in the day, at night is another thing
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s-a holding my hand
She looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
She said, “You can’t repeat the past.” I said, “You can’t? What do you mean
You can’t? Of course you can.”
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry, that’s nothing you would need to know
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
[Verse 3]
I got eight carburetors, boys, I’m using ’em all
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I’m using ’em all
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t going down
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it’s information you want, you can get it from the police
Politician's got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
He's 
sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me[Verse 4]
Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginning to shake
Standing by God’s river, my soul's beginning to shake
I’m counting on you, love, to give me a break
Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Gon' break the roof in, set fire to the place as a parting gift
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days, summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on
