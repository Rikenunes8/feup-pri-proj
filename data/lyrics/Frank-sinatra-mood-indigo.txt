[Chorus]
You ain't been blue, no, no, no
You ain't been blue 'til you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues"
[Bridge]
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evening when the lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die
[Chorus]
You ain't been blue, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You ain't been blue 'til you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I just sit around and sigh, "Go 'long blues"
