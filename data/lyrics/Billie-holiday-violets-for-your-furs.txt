You brought me violets for my furs
And it was spring for a while, remember?
You brought me violets for my furs
And there was April in that December
The snow drifted on the flowers
And melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day
You brought me violets for my furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
You pinned the violets to my furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then, one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day that you brought me violets for my furs
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then, one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day that you brought me violets for my furs
