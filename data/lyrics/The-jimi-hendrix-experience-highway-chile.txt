[Verse 1]
Yeah, his guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his Cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin
He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see
But everybody knows the boss
A rolling stone who gathers no moss
But you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad
I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind
But everybody knows the same old story
In love and war you can't lose the glory
Now you'd probably call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 3]
Walk on brother, yeah
One more brother
His old guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his Cadillac
Flamin' hair just a-blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sinNow you may call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile
[Outro]
Walk on brother
Don't let no one stop you
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile
Rolling stone
Go on down the highway
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile
