No, I was just telling that I, I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her, she thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, "It's, it's over, I can't believe you"
I said, "Come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house"
That's, it means, like, it's jealousy, pure jealousy
For nothing, you know?
Virtual thing
