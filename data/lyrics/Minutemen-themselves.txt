All these men who work the land
Should evaluate themselves and make a stand
Can't they see beyond the rhetoric?
The lies and promises that don't mean shit
And all the men who learned to hate them
And all the men who learned to hate them
They keep themselves hidden away
They keep themselves upon the hill
Afraid that they'll have to pay
For all the crimes upon their head
And all the men who learned to hate them
And all the men who learned to hate them
