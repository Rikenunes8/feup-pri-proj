I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've feel so bad, my baby gone
I ain't got nobody, staying home with me
I ain't got nobody, staying home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no loving, since my baby's been gone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no loving, since my baby been gone
Everybody
Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone
