[Chorus 1]
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
[Chorus 2]
Sitting here in Queens
Eating re-fried beans
We're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down Thorazines
We ain't got no friends
Our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men
[Verse]
Daddy's telling lies
Baby's eating flies
Mommy's on pills
Baby's got the chills
I'm friends with the president
I'm friends with the pope
We're all making a fortune
Selling Daddy's dope
[Chorus 2]
Sitting here in Queens
Eating re-fried beans
We're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down Thorazines
We ain't got no friends
Our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men
[Chorus 1]
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
