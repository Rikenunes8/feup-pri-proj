[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I'm chillin at the spot
And my posse's 4 deep
Had my man on my mind
Turned my head, what did I see?
The fellas lookin' fly
There was one that caught my eye
So I bit my lip, switched my hips as I walked by
Saying "Sexy boy, you so fly
I just might give you a try
I'ma write yo number in the palm of my hand"
Oops, I forgot I got a man
[Chorus]
I know you see me watchin' you (You're so sexy)
And I see you watchin' me (Yeah)
'Cause boy, your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watchin' you
And I see you watchin' me
'Cause boy, your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watchin' you
And I see you watchin' me (Sexy)
'Cause boy, your body's callin' (Yeah)
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watchin' you
And I see you watchin' me (Watch-watching me)
'Cause boy, your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'm thinkin' to myself
'Should I even take the chance?'
'Should I do what's on my mind
Or should I stay down with my man?'
This boy, he got me fiendin'
I'm wantin' him so bad
Should I chill one night with him, and risk everything I had?
Saying "Sexy boy, you so fly
I wish I could give you a try
But my man's at home waiting for me by the phone"
Sorry, can't get my groove on
[Chorus]
I know you see me watchin' you (You're so)
And I see you watchin' me (Sexy)
'Cause boy, your body's callin' (Yeah)
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watchin' you
And I see you watchin' me
'Cause boy, your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me (The temptation)
I know you see me watchin' you
And I see you watchin' me
'Cause boy, your body's callin' (It's killin' me)
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watchin' you
And I see you watchin' me
'Cause boy, your body's callin'
