[Verse 1]
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through all these highs and lows
I heard there was no sickness and no toil or danger
Just mercy and plenty where peaceful waters flow
Where peaceful waters flow
[Verse 2]
Come all you fair and tender school girls
Be careful now when you court young men
They are like the stars on a summer morning
They sparkle up the night and they're gone again
Daybreak, gone again
[Verse 3]
If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor
What a killing crime this love can be
I would have locked up my heart in a golden sheath of armor
And kept its crazy beating under strictest secrecy
High security
[Verse 4]
I wish I had the wings of Noah's pretty little white dove
So I could fly this raging river to reach the one I love
But I have no wings and the water is so wide
We'll have to row a little harder, it's just in dreams we fly
In my dreams we fly
