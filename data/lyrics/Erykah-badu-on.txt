[Intro]
A one-one, two one two
[Verse 1]
On & on & on & on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
Say, wait a minute, Queen, what's your name?
See, I be that gypsy flippin' life game from the right brain
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a supernova star
She be the light when they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
A cross up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why
[Hook]
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
[Verse 2]
Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well, well, I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men
Two fish, one swimmin' up stream
One swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns, smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The Rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow, zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling, melanated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this Earth
What...[Hook]
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
Bridge!
[Bridge]
I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal
Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material (material)
"'Cause you did not do your math"
"My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone"
"Mad props to the God JaBorn"[Verse 3]
Things just ain't the same for singers
Gotta sing on the beats they bring us
But that's all I have, ain't got no mo'
But still the people really wanna to know
[Hook]
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
