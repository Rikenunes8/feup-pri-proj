[Verse]
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
Oh, I can see you standing there now
And you're the prettiest thing in the crowd
And guess who'll be laughing loud but me
You made me see the love that you're giving me
Baby, won't you hold my hand?
Now, that kind of makes a fool understand
Just let me know that I'm your man
And show I'm not ashamed
I walk the floor when you leave me
Baby, I don't know about you
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to make my dreams come true
With you, baby
With you, baby, yeah
[Outro]
I wanna say, I've been crying about your love
The nighttime find me wetting my pillow
But I, really I don't, I don't mind, no
But if you you just let me say it again
I've been crying
I wish old trouble would leave me alone
But I've been crying
Oh, come on and stop the rain right now, yeah
Stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain, yeah
Baby, baby, yeah
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
Hey, yeah, baby
