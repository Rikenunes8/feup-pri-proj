We people who are 
darker than blue
Are we gonna stand around this town
And let 
what others
 say come true?
We're just good for nothing, they all figure
A boyish, grown-up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
We people who are darker than blue
This ain't no time for segregatin'
I'm talking 'bout brown and yellow, too
High yellow gal, can't you tell
You're just the surface of our dark, deep well?
If your mind could really see
You'd know your color the same as me
Pardon me, brother, 
as you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Get yourself together, learn to know your sign
Shall we commit our own genocide
Before you check out your mind?
I know we've all got problems
That's why I'm here to say
Keep peace with me and I with you
Let me love in my own way
Now I know we have great respect
For the sister
And mother, it's even better yet
But there's the joker in the street
Loving one brother and killing the other
When the time comes and we are really free
There'll be no brothers left, you see
We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true
We're just good for nothing, they all figure
A boyish, grown-up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
Pardon me, brother, while you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Pardon me, brother, I know we've come a long, long way
But let us not be so satisfied
For tomorrow can be an
An even brighter day
