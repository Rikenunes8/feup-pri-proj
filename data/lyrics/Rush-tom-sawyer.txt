[Intro]
A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride
[Verse 1]
Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river
[Chorus]
What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift
[Bridge]
The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
And the space he invades, he gets by on you[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is
[Chorus]
And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit
[Refrain]
The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide
[Outro]
Exit the warrior
Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the energy you trade
He gets right on to
The friction of the day
