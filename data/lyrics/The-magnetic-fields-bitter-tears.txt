[Chorus]
Bitter tears keep me goin'
Through the years, freely flowin'
What have you done?
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears
[Verse 1]
The endless streets I walk along
You made them seem pretty
But now I dream in country songs
And wake in New York City
And the only beauty here
Is the moon seen through the tear
[Chorus]
Bitter tears keep me goin'
Through the years, freely flowin'
What have you done?
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears
[Verse 2]
I cry because it looks so good
I cry, why not, it's free
And there's nothing more interesting
Than crying constantly
And as I tell everyone
Crying all the time is fun
[Chorus]
Bitter tears keep me goin'
Through the years, freely flowin'
What have you done?
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears
