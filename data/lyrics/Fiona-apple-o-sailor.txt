[Verse 1]
I'm undecided about you again
Mightn't be right that you're not here
It's double-sided cause I ruined it all
But also saved myself
By never believing you, Dear
[Verse 2]
Everything good I deem too good to be true
Everything else is just a bore
Everything I have to look forward to
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before
[Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
[Verse 3]
I have too been playing with fifty-two cards
Just cause I play so far from my vest
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard
What could I do but spend my best[Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
[Bridge]
And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me
And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed
One who set to get me wise and got me there and then, got me
[Verse 4]
And what a thing to know what could be instead
Oh what a blessed curse to see
It took the agenda from its place in my bed
Made a merry paramour of me
[Modified Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes 
by the boards[Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
[Modified Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes 
by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes 
by the boards
