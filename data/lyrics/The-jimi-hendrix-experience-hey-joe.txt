[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?
[Verse 2]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool
[Verse 3]
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground
[Verse 4]
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught her messing around, messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun, I shot her!
[Guitar Solo/Bridge]
Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby
[Verse 5]
Hey Joe, where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it
[Verse 6]
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me[Verse 7]
Ain't no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now, I got to go now
