You told me you love me
Said you wanna be with me
You told me you love me
Said that you wanna be with me
You looked right into my eyes
Said I'm not like the other guys
You looked right into my eyes
Said I'm not like the other guys
I know what I think I saw
And what I thought I seen
And what was coming and what was going
And everything in between
And what I thought I heard you say
And what you really said
And what I thought you thought I thought
Was actually in your head
And what you meant to tell me
And what I meant to say
And what I said you said I said
What went the other way
I know what you did to me
And I know what we did
And who did what to who
And who the hell are you trying to kid?
You told me you love me
You said you wanna be with me
You told me you love me
You said you wanna be with me
You looked right into my eyes
Said I'm not like the other guys
You looked right into my eyes
Said I'm not like the other guys
I know more than you think I know
More than you think about
And know and think you know and think
You got it all figured out
I know I'm missing something
Something's missing here and there
And all over and over around
And up and everywhere
And you're just all up in it
Look out, your zipper is gonna break
And I popped your little party favor
And you just take the cake
I can't believe I believed you
When I found out where you're at
And findin' out why you're too much
I'm trying to wrap my head around thatYou told me you love me
You said you wanna be with me
You told me you love me
You said you wanna be with me
You told me you love me
You said you wanna be with me
You told me you love me
You said you wanna be with me
