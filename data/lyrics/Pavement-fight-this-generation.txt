[Verse 1]
Look up to people so tall to you
I can't, so I won't stand
Up chuck break luck
Look for the splinters you might see where they come out
[Chorus 1]
Go down, 
sweet Yardley
I won't let you fall down, sweet Yardley
I won't let you fall down here now
[Verse 2]
God damn the guts and the gore
Nobody's crying cause there's no one to score for
[Chorus 2]
Come up, sweet Randy
I won't let you fall, what you gotta lose?
What you gotta prove?
Who you gonna screw?
Down here now
Here now
I am here now
I am here now
[Break]
[Outro]
Your life is selected to come
Waiting for the amelioration
Generation, fight this generation
Fight this generation
Fight this gener
Fight this generation, fight this generation, fight this generation
Fight this
Fight this generation, fight this generation, fight this generation
Gener
Fight this generation, fight this generation, fight this generation
Fight this gener
Fight this generation, fight this generation, fight this generation
