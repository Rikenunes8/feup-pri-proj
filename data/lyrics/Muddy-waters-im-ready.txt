I am ready, as ready as anybody can be
I am ready, ready as anybody can be
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me
I got a axe-handled pistol on my graveyard frame
That shoot tombstone bullets, wearing balls and chain
I'm drinking TNT, I'm smoking dynamite
I hope some screwball start a fight
'Cause I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me
All you pretty little chicks with your curly hair
I know you feel like I ain't nowhere
Well, stop what you're doing, baby, come over here
I'll prove to you baby that I ain't no square
Because I'm ready, as ready as anybody can be
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me
[Harmonica solo]
I been drinking gin like never before
I feel so good I want you to know
One more drink, I wish you would
I takes a whole lotta loving to make me feel good
'Cause I'm ready, as ready as anybody can be
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me
