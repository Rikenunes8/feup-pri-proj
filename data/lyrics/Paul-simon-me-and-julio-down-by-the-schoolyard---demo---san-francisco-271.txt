The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
And he started the investigation

It's against the law, it was against the law
What the Mama saw, it was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said "Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"
Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio down by the schoolyard


Whoa, in a couple of days, they come and take me away
But the press let the story leak
Now when the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek

And I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio down by the schoolyard
