[Intro]
[Verse 1]
You can run miles and breathe easy
Feel the cool fresh air at least the hold you don't (canâ€™t) see
[Chorus 1]
Do you want kids?
Wanna see your kids, kids?
If you do you better come out of the mist, kids!
[Bridge]
That love affair with a cigarette
Will end on the rocks baby you can bet
Better smoke as many as you can get
Before your lungs are locked and you end in debt to yourself
[Instrumental]
[Chorus 2]
Do you want kids?
Wanna see your kids, kids?
If you do you better come out of the mist, kids!
Come on now!
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
Will power can be poor health
You can't help nobody else until you help yourself
