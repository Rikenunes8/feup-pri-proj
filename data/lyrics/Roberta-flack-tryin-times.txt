[Verse 1]
Tryin' times is what the world is talkin' about
You got confusion all over the land, yeah
Mother against daughter, father against son
The whole thing is gettin' out of hand
[Chorus]
But folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love for your brother
But these are tryin' times
[Verse 2]
You got the riots in the ghetto, and it's all around
A whole lot of things that's wrong is going down
I don't understand it, my point of view
I remember somebody said "Do unto others
As you would have them do unto you"
[Chorus]
And then folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love
But these are tryin' times
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
People always talking about man's inhumanity to man
But what is you tryin' to do to make this a better land?
Just pick up your paper, turn on your TV
You see a lot of demonstrations for equality
[Chorus]
But folks, folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love
But these are tryin' times, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Tryin' times is what the world is talkin' about
You got confusion all over, all over, over the land
Mother against daughter, father against son
The whole thing is gettin' out of hand
Folks, folks, wouldn't have to suffer...
