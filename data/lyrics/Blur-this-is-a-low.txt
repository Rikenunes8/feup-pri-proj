[Verse 1]
And into the sea
Goes pretty England and me
Around the Bay of Biscay
And back for tea
Hit traffic on the Dogger Bank
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank
Sail on by with the tide
And go to sleep
And the radio says
[Chorus]
This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you're alone
It will be there with you
Finding ways to stay solo
[Verse 2]
Up the Tyne, Forth and Cromarty
There's a low in the high forties
Saturday's locked away on the pier
Not fast enough, dear
And on the Malin head
Blackpool looks blue and red
And the Queen, she's gone 'round the bend
Jumped off Land's End
And the radio says
[Chorus]
This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you're alone
It will be there with you
Finding ways to stay solo
[Instrumental Bridge][Chorus]
This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you're alone
It will be there with you
This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you're alone
It will be there with you
Finding ways to stay solo
