[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind
People stop, starin' at me
I don't even see their faces
Only the shadow of their eyes
[Verse 1]
Going where the sun keeps a-shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
[Refrain]
Why? Why, why, why? Why?
Why?
Why? Why?
Why?
[Verse 2]
I said, everybody keeps talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin', now
Only the echoes of my mind
People stop, starin' at me
I don't even see their faces
Only the shadow of their eyes
[Bridge]
Skippin', skippin', skippin', skip, skip
Over the ocean like a stone
[Outro]
Hey, I said, why, why? Why?
Why, why?
