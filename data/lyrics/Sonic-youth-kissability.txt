[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes, don't you trust me?
You're so good, you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna?
You could be a star, you could go far
You've got twistability
You fly hard, don't you wanna?
You've got kissability
You could be a star, it ain't hard
[Chorus]
You're driving me crazy
You smell so sick
You're driving me crazy
Give us a kiss
[Verse 2]
Look into my eyes, don't you trust me?
You're so soft, you make me hard
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna?
You could be a star, you could go far
You've got kissability
You sigh hard, don't you wanna?
You've got twistability
You could be a star, it ain't hard
[Chorus]
You're driving me crazy
You smell so sick
I feel so tired
You make me sick
You're driving me crazy
I feel so sick
You're driving me crazy
Give us a kiss
[Verse 3]
Look into my eyes, don't you diss me
You're so good, you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna?
You could be a star, you could go far
You've got twistability
You fly hard, don't you wanna?
You've got kissability
You could be a star, it ain't hard[Chorus]
You're driving me crazy
Smell so sick
You're driving me crazy
Give us a kiss
