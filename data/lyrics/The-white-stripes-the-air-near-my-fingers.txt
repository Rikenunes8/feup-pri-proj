[Verse 1]
Life is so boring
It's really got me snoring
I'm wearing out the flooring in a cheap motel
But I don't have to work and
I might be sinning
But I'm never gonna have to hear the rings of school bells
Do-do do-do-do-do do-do do-do-do-do-do
Do-do do-do-do-do do-do do-do-do-do-do
[Verse 2]
Don't you remember?
You told me in December
That a boy is not a man until he makes a stand
Well, I'm not a genius
But maybe you'll remember this
I never said I ever wanted to be a man
Do-do do-do-do-do do-do do-do-do-do-do
Do-do do-do-do-do do-do do-do-do-do-do
[Chorus]
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
Hey[Verse 3]
My mom is so caring
She's really got me staring
At all the crazy little things she does for sure
And I can't seem to think of
Another kind of love
That a boy could ever get from anyone but her
Do-do do-do-do-do do-do do-do-do-do-do
Do-do do-do-do-do do-do do-do-do-do-do
[Chorus]
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
I get nervous when she comes around
When she comes around, when she comes around
All right
