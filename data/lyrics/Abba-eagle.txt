[Verse 1]
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
[Verse 2]
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
[Pre-Chorus]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
[Verse 3]
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
[Verse 4]
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?
[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
