It's 4 a.m. in New York City, 3 a.m. in Dallas
The night is still early here in Frisco
Market Street is still going, the same old shows are showing
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
They say it's raining in Chicago, but it's cold and clear in Denver
Been windy all night long here in Frisco
Trolley cars are clinging, the big Bay Town is swinging
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
The way I feel tonight, I won't be staying long
But when I leave, I'll leave my heart just like in the famous song
Trolley cars are clinging, the big Bay City is swinging
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
