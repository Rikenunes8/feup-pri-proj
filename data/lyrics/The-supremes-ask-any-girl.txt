[Verse 1]
Being hurt by the one you love
It's a feeling that's hard to hide
But you don't seem to understand why
When I'm alone I sit and cry
[Verse 2]
Ask any girl
Who's often left alone
All by herself
Neglectfully pushed aside
Set aside like a doll on a shelf
Just ask any girl
Ooh, and you'll understand why
I sit and cry
[Verse 3]
Ask any girl
Who knows the fear of losing
Someone dear
And she'll say the same thing
It hurts you deep
Makes it hard to sleep
Don't take my word
Ask any girl
Then you'll understand why
I sit and cry
[Verse 4]
Ask any girl
Who receives no loving affection
And she'll feel as I feel
It's heartaches by the number
Many nights without slumber
Ask any girl
Ooh, and then you'll know why
I sit and cry
I sit and cry
