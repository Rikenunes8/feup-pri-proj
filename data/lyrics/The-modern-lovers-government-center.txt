You know, we have a lot of hard work to do today
What might that be, Jonathan?
Well we've got a lot a lot of hard work today
We got to rock at the 
Government Center
To make the secretaries feel better
When they put the stamps on the letter
They got a lot a lot a lot of great desks and chairs now
At the Government Center
Where they put the stamps on the letter
And then they write it down in the ledger
So we got to rock rock rock non stop tonight
At the 
Government Center
Where they put the stamps on the letter
And then they write it down in the ledger
We won't stop until we see secretaries smile
And see some office boys jump up for joy
We'll tell old Mr. Ahern "Calm down a while
Sir, that's the only way the Center is ever going to get better"
So we got to rock rock rock non stop tonight
At the Government Center
Where they put the stamps on the letter
And then they write it down in the ledger
Oh, tonight we'll make them feel all right
Oh, tonight
What you say man?
Make them feel better
Oh yes, tonight
We'll go there tonight
We'll take everything we've got
We'll take the amps
We'll take the guitars
We'll do anything just to make these secretaries feel better
At the Government Center
