[Intro: Method Man]
Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming
[Chorus: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, honey dip, summertime fine, Jheri dripping
Seen you on Pitkins
 
with a bunch of chickens how you're cliquing
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a freshwater scrod, or may I not be God?
Attitude is very rude, boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love, hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right, true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me, hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
Goddamn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered, put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo, pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
But, uh, back to you, Maybelline queen, let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except cream
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu[Chorus: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Shaolin's finest, what up, boo? Peace, your highness
Yo, I'm lounging big dick style, y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making, too fly, jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good, fly-colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black?
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square, dear
You better have cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui, yeah
[Chorus: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like thunder
Politic to your deficit step, give me your number
Your sexy persuasive tatas and thighs
Catch my eyes like pies, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time
Ice cream, you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh, baby, I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind-state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me?
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby, shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you wanna get dug like the pockets
I jizz 'em like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets
[Pre-Chorus: Method Man]
Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas, what?
It's the afterparty and bitches wanna fuck
[Chorus: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
And want they titties sucked, ice cream, yeah
Your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream[Outro: Method Man]
One love to my chocolate deluxes
Keep your nails done and your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter pecan Ricans for calling me papi
That's for real
One love to caramel sundaes with the cherries on top, yeah
And big up to my French vanillas
Parlez-vous fran√ßais? Mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons and all that good stuff
That good stuff
