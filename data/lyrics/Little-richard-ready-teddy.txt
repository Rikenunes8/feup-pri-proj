[Intro]
Ready, set, go man go
I got a girl that I love so
[Chorus]
I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll
[Verse 1]
Goin' to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock and roll, baby, she's the apple of my eye
[Chorus]
I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll
[Verse 2]
All the flat top cats and all the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint's really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style
[Chorus]
I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready, whoo
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll, ow

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock and roll, baby, pour on the steam

Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll
