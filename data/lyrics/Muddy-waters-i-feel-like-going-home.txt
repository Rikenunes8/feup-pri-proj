[Verse 1]
Well, it gettin' late on into the evenin' and I feel like
Like blowin' my horn
When I woke up this mornin' all I had
I had was gone, gettin'
Late on in the evenin', I feel like, like blowin' my horn
Well I woke up this mornin', and all I had was gone (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Well, brooks run into the ocean, ocean run in, into the sea
If I don't find my woman, somebody gonna sure bury me
Brooks run into the ocean, and the ocean run into the sea
Well now, if I don't find my baby, woo-hoo, well man somebody gonna bury me
[Spoken]
Johnny, you know what I mean, dontcha? (Yeah)
[Instrumental]
[Spoken]
That remind me of 1967, Johnny
When I had a hard time with a lot of girls
Finally got myself straight, I got someone I love right now
[Instrumental]
(Yeah! Yeah!)
[Verse 3]
Well, minutes seemed like hours (No), and hours seemed like days (Yeah)
Seemed like my woman, boy, would stop her old evil ways
Minutes seemed like hours, and hours seemed like days
Well, seems like my baby, hehe, well man
Would stop her low-down ways
