My love was in a storm
The bitter wind was blowin' around me
I'd sit and cry
But by and by
It just faded away
Rainbow
Painted skies
Brought a smile into my eyes
The scent of flowers filled the air
I turned around
And you were there
Hey, you made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me
Ooh
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
Ooh, ooh
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' againOne kiss
Is worth a thousand sighing words
When you're lonely
I saw you smile
It was warm
Now I see beyond the storm
Clouds are fading fast
There goes the sad and bitter past
You touched my life
When no one cared
You did the things
That no one dared
You've opened doors
You've made me see
That love is the key
To make the sun shine
For me
Ooh
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' givin' againSince you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin', givin' again
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
