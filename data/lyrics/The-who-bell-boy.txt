[Jimmy 1]
The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Hazy days
Crazy days
[Jimmy 2]
Aren't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
[Ace Face 1]
I've got a good job and I'm newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel all gilt and flash
Remember the gaff where the doors were 
smashed
?
[Ace Face Chorus]
Bell Boy!
I got to get running now
Bell Boy!
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy!
Carry this baggage out
Bell Boy!
Always running at someone's bleeding heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel
[Ace Face 2]
Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
Then I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks
[Jimmy 1]
The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Crazy days, crazy days
Crazy days, crazy days[Jimmy 2]
Aren't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
[Ace Face 3]
People often change
But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot
From a life like mine
The secret to me
It ain't flown like a flag
I carry it behind this bleeding little badge
What says
[Ace Face Chorus]
Bell Boy!
I got to get running now
Bell Boy!
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy!
Carry the bloody baggage out
Bell Boy!
Always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel
