It's true, darling, I'll walk you home
I'll be your date forever
I love you girl, yes, I love you
Until they split the atom
So many times, there's nothing left
There's nothing left at all
I know I'm right, 'cause when I'm gone
There's nothing left at all
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right, hold
Salute
