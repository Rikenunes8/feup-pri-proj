[Verse 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria
[Refrain]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
[Verse 2]
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria
[Refrain]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
[Chorus]
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]

(No, I don't have a gun)
[Chorus]
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun[Refrain]
