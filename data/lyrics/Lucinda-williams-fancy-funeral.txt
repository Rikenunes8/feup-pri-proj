Some think a fancy funeral
Would be worth every cent
For every dime and nickel
There's money better spent
Better spent on groceries
And covering the bills
Instead of little luxuries
And unnecessary frills
Lovely yellow daffodils
And lacy filigree
Pretty little angels
For everyone to see
Lilly of the valley
Long black limousines
It's three or four months' salary
Just to pay for all those things
So don't buy a fancy funeral
It's not worth it in the end
Goodbyes can still be beautiful
With all the money that you'll spend
'Cause no amount of riches
Can bring back what you've lost
To satisfy your wishes
You'll never justify the cost
