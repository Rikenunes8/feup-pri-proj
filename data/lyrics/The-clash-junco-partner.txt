[Verse 1]
Down the road came a Junco Partner
Boy, he was loaded as can be
He was knocked out, knocked out loaded
He was a'wobblin' all over the street
Singin' "6 months ain't no sentence
And one year ain't no time
I was born in Angola
Servin' 14 to 99"
Well I wish I had me $1 million dollars
One million to call my own (All my own)
I would raise me and say, "Grow for me baby"
Raise me a tobacco farm
[Chorus]
Take a walk
Take a walk, Junco Partner
Hey! Don't bother me
Like that!
[Verse 2]
Well, when I had me a great deal of money
Yeah  had mighty good friends all over town
Now I ain't got no more money
All of my good friends just put me down
So now I gotta pawn my ratchett and pistol
Yeah, I gonna pawn my watch and chain
I would have pawned my sweet Gabriella
But the smart girl she wouldn't sign her name
[Verse 3]
Down the road came a Junco Partner
Boy, he was loaded as can be
He was knocked out, knocked out loaded
He was a'wobblin' all over the street
I can't walk!
I can't walk!
[Verse 4]
Down the road a'came a Junco Partner
"Hey, mister" he called out to me
And it was three things he shouted
Singin', singin'
Oh!
Junco Partner
Well I'm down, yes I'm getting thirsty
Pour me out a good beer, when I'm dry
Just, just give me whisky, when I'm thirsty
Give me headstone when I die
Down the road
