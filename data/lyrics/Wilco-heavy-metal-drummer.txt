[Verse 1]
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love
[Verse 2]
Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love
[Chorus]
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
[Verse 3]
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears
[Verse 1]
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love
[Chorus]
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
