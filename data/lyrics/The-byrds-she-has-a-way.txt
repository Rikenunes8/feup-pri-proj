I was really good to her
But how she broke my heart
She looked so young and she seemed so sweet
But I was wrong from the start
She has a way about her
That makes her run around
Now I wonder if she'll ever
Want to settle down
Oh oh, oh oh
I waited so impatiently
It didn't do my mind any good
I never thought she would set me free
I did all the things that I should
Then all at once I looked for her
'Cause she could not be found
Now I wonder if she'll ever
Want to settle down
Oh oh, oh oh
I didn't think that I
Would wait for her very long
But I didn't realize
My love for her was so strongShe might be going from heart to heart
She might be puttin' them down
The way she took me all apart
And made me the laugh of the town
She has a way about her
That makes her run around
Now I wonder if she'll ever
Want to settle down
Oh oh
