Sister Anne don't give a damn about evolution
She's a liberated woman, she's got her solution
Like a dinosaur, she's going off the wall
She's gonna make it her own crusade
She's got a heart of gold, gonna save a bitch's soul
From goin' down Satan's hot way
She can I know she can
I know she can
She's my Sister Anne
Such truth, such beauty, such purity
She wears a halo around her head
She's got the Ten Commandments tattooed on her arm
If she died she'd rise up from the dead
She's every man saviour and Mama too
If you do it she said she'll save hell from you
She can I know she can
I know she can
She's my Sister Anne
(Refrain)
Sister won't you tell me where I went so wrong
I used to say my prayers baby all night long
I'd listen to the Gospel ringing in my ears
Come on Sister Anne save me from my fears if you can
I know you can
I know you can
You're my Sister Anne
After Sunday school Mass she goes to see her man
She always does the best that she can
She never tries to tease, she always aims to please
She's gonna squeeze you tight and make you feel alright
Cause she can
I know she can
I know she can
She's my Sister Anne
She's my Sister Anne
She's my Sister Anne . .
