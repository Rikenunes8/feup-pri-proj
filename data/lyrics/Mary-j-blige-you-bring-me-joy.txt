[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
[Chorus]
I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life, boy (In my life, boy)
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy
[Verse 1]
You know if the time is right
I don't wanna fuss and fight
I just wanna let you know
I'm feeling good tonight
I want you to take my hand and promise you'll be cool
Because I know you like the way that I move
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh boy, you bring me joy
Some try to play me
But they can't fade me
Oh boy, you've go it goin' on
And you make me happy (Happy)
So very happy
[Chorus]
I don't know what I would do
Do without you (I don't know, I don't know)
In my life, boy (What I'm gonna do)
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy
[Verse 2]
You know when I think of you
I'm thinkin' of myself
I just wanna be with you, my friend
And no one else
It's not hard to say what I feel
Because you know that my love is for real[Pre-Chorus]
Oh boy, I'll be your toy
Come on and play with me
And never leave me
Oh boy, you've got it goin' on
And you satisfy me (Yes, you do)
You satisfy me
[Bridge]
So much joy
In my world (Ooh, la la la)
Be my man (Be my man)
And I'll be your girl
[Chorus]
I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life, boy (What I'm gonna do, yeah)
I don't know if I could live (I don't know if I could live)
Live without you
You bring me joy
[Verse 3]
Wait just a minute
Something else is on my mind
I don't wanna have to tell you this but one more time
You're the only man I want
And I am never gonna front
On ya, baby, so relax your mind
And realize[Chorus]
I don't know what I would do
Do without you (Realize that I'ma do you right)
In my life, boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy (Oh no, yeah)
I don't know what I would do (I don't know)
Do without you
In my life, boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
