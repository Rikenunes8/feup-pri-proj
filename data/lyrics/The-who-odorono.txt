[Verse 1]
She sang the best she'd ever sang
She couldn't ever sing any better
But Mister Davidson never rang
She knew he would forget her
[Chorus 1]
She'd seen him there
And put herself to ransom
He had stared
He really was quite handsome
[Verse 2]
She had really looked her best
She couldn't ever look any better
But she knew she'd failed the test
She knew he would forget her
[Chorus 2 ]
Triumphant! was the way she felt
As she acknowledged the applause
Triumphant! was the way she'd felt
When she saw him at the dressing room door
[Verse 3]
She was happier than she'd ever been
As he praised her for her grace
But his expression changed, she had seen
As he leant to kiss her face[Bridge]
It ended there
He claimed a late appointment
She quickly turned
To hide her disappointment
[Verse 4]
She ripped her glittering gown
Couldn't face another show, no
Her deodorant had let her down
She should have used Odorono
