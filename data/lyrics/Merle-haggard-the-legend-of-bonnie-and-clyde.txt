[Verse]
Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde
The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each getaway
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught
They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dying, they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde
Two years of running was ended that day
For robbing and killing, they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde
