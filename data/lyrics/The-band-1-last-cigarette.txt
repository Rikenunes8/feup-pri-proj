I can't, I can't, I can't stand the man
I'm seeing in the mirror
I try, I try to get my mind right
But it never gets much clearer

Maybe I should see somebody
'Cause I can't keep this up
Everything inside my body
Is telling me to stop
All my friends, they left me for dead
And I don't have a clue where I am
I lost my keys now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette
All my friends, they hate me again
I get too drunk when I get depressed
I lost my shit now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette

I can't, I can't, I can't pay the rent
'Cause I wasted all my money
I try, I try to laugh off my life
But lately, it's not funny (Funny)

Maybe I should see somebody
'Cause I can't keep this up
Everything inside my body
Is telling me to stop

All my friends, they left me for dead
And I don't have a clue where I am
I lost my keys now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette
All my friends, they hate me again
I get too drunk when I get depressed
I lost my shit now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette

All my friends, they left me for dead
And I don't have a clue where I am
I lost my keys now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette
All my friends, they hate me again
I get too drunk when I get depressed
I lost my shit now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette

All my friends, they hate me again
Lost my shit now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette

Maybe I should see somebody
'Cause I can't keep this up
Everything inside my body
Is telling me to stop
