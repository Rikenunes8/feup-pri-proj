Started the tour out in Denver, Colorado
I made the first one but I did not make the second show
Yeah, uh

It's safe to say I been this way since I was eighteen
The same night I fall in love, I feel it fading
Who can you love, who can you trust now that you're mainstream?
Don't want no love, don't got no trust, I feel me changin' (Yeah)
Sometimes I think about my high school sweetheart (Oh-oh-oh)
But times change, people change and grow apart
I fell so hard and fast for Dee, I wanna start a family (Family)
She show resentment, she got pregnant, and she felt abandoned (Oh-oh-oh)
That shit with what's-her-namе was faster than I had planned it (Oh-oh-oh)
She movеd away from San Diego, livin' in Miami (Miami)
We caught a flight to Puerto Rico, she was sweet as candy (Candy)
She just ain't know she had my heart before the plane landed (Yeah)
And by the time I got home (Oh-oh-oh), I just wanted to be alone
I met Brianna through Kearra, they were the best of friends (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
She turned her head, and we moved up just like the Jeffersons (Yeah)
I need your all each and every day (Oh), if I can't then I'll fade
And I don't mean to rush, but I easily fall in love (Yeah)
Uh, in my head I know that that ain't right
But I believe in first sight, yeah
We can fall in love right here tonight
Run away and be together for life
No more cold Decembers, lonely cold Decembers
No Decembers, lonely cold Decembers (Yeah)
No more Decembers, lonely cold Decembers (Yeah)
Cold Decembers (Yeah), lonely cold Decembers, yeah

Mmm (Grrah), yeah
Uh, uh-uh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh-uh, yeah
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I guess you could say that my love life was not up to par
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her that I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
