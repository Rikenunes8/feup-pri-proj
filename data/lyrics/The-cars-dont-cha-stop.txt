[Verse 1]
Right here I'd like to melt inside of you
Right here your kiss is totally new
Right here your hands are soft and creamy
Right here your mouth is wet and dreamy
And it's just what I like, so dim down the light
[Chorus]
(Don't cha stop, don't cha stop, don't cha stop, don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 2]
Your rhapsody is blowing my cool-ool
Your fantasies there written for the fools
Your long black hair, it tickles my skin, skin
It feels so luscious come on do it again, oh yeah
It knows just what I like, dim down the light
[Chorus]
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good, good, good, good, good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
Don't cha stop, oh, don't cha stop
[Outro]
A don't cha stop if it makes you feel g-g-good
Ooh, don't cha stop, don't cha stop
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
Don't you stop, don't cha stop
If it makes you feel g-g-good, g-g-good, g-g-good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
Yeah, yeah, don't cha stop
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop, don't cha stop don't cha stop)
