[Verse 1: Bilinda Butcher]
Midnight wish
Blow me a kiss
Holding onto you
Make like this
Trying to pretend it's true
Ooh
[Verse 2: Bilinda Butcher]
Show me all your favorite things
Show you all mine too
Wake and wish
I'll give them all to you
Ooh
[Verse 3: Bilinda Butcher]
Hold on to your promises
Hold on to mine too
Caught like this
I'll turn it in with you
Ooh
[Verse 4: Bilinda Butcher]
Fall apart my beating heart
Nothing left to do
Once in love
I'll be the death of you
Ooh
