[Verse 1]
I beat my machine
It's a part of me, it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me, I am becoming
[Chorus 1]
The me that you know, he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs, he is broken and sore
The me that you know, he doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore
[Verse 2]
All pain disappears
It's the nature of of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear
No escape from this, my new consciousness
[Chorus 2]
The me that you know, he used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he is left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you, I'm so far away
[Post-Chorus]
I can try to get away but Iâ€™ve strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all of my bad parts
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear
[Bridge]
Hiding backwards inside of me
I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter
I might just slip away
[Outro]
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
