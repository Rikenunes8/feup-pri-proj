[Verse 1]
Must be a rush for me
To see a lazy
A brain he meant to be
Cop out? He's crazy
But who's believing who?
Who's doin' the fishin'?
Do what you wanna do
Or keep on wishin'
[Chorus]
Timber
Ah, all fall down
Timber
Who's around?
Watch out 'cause the summer's getting cold
When today gets too old
[Verse 2]
Must be a rush for you
To see a lazy
In his backyard he grew
Cop out? He's crazy
When life means much to you
Why live for dyin'?
If you are doing right
Why are you cryin'?[Chorus]
Timber
Ah, all fall down
Timber
Ah, who's around?
Watch out 'cause the summer gets cold
When today gets too old
