[Verse 1]
Once my lover, now my friend
What a cruel thing to pretend
What a cunning way to condescend
Once my lover, and now my friend
[Verse 2]
Oh, you creep up like the clouds
And you set my soul at ease
Then you let your love abound
And you bring me to my knees
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's evil, babe
The way you let your grace enrapture me
When well you know I'd be insane
To ever let that dirty game recapture me
[Chorus]
You made me a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
I've been swinging around me
'Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Oh, your gaze is dangerous
And you fill your space so sweet
If I let you get too close
You'll set your spell on me
[Verse 4]
So, darlin', I just want to say
Just in case I don't come through
I was on to every play
I just wanted you[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so evil, my love
The way you've no reverence to my concern
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love
To save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn
[Chorus]
So, I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around at nothing
I don't know when you're gonna make your move
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around me
'Cause I don't know when you'll make your move
