[Intro]
Oh wonderful baby!
Oh wonderful one!
[Verse 1]
Wonderful baby, wonderful one
I can't describe all the wonders you've done
You came to my life
It was barren and bare
You put some love and care in there
[Verse 2]
So warm and sweet
You came and swept me off my feet
That day came my way
I heard you say you belong to me
Heard you say your love was strong for me
It was a dream come true
Hearing this from you!
So wonderful!
[Chorus]
(Oh wonderful baby!) Wonderful, wonderful baby!
(Oh wonderful one!) Oh, you are my wonderful one!
[Verse 3]
Until you came along
I was sure a lonely one
With no hope of finding real true love
I didn't think it could ever be done
Then all at once that occurred
And now you have shown there's hope for the lonely!
[Verse 4]
So tenderly
You came and brought me ecstasy
That day you came my way
I heard you say that you would be true
I heard you say the words I love you
The most wonderful words
I've ever heard, so wonderful![Chorus]
(Oh wonderful baby!) Wonderful baby!
(Oh wonderful one!) Oh my wonderful one!
Oh wonderful baby!
