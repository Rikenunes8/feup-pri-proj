[Verse 1]
At night it hits me cold
There's so much more to life than I'll ever know
I look around and I realise
It's time to make a move though you don't sympathise
[Pre-Chorus]
Stars collect overhead
They look down over China and I might as well be dead
Cars pass on through the night
How do you get to heaven if you never try?
[Chorus]
New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another part in a different scene
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Make a firm decision, it's time to go
That's for you to find out and for me to know
No more hard times or petty crimes
Forget that life I have left behind
[Pre-Chorus]
The night goes by
Leaving you behind me as I fly
Then rise the daylight sky
How do you get to heaven if you never try?
[Chorus]
New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another part in a different scene[Bridge]
A new life, it's so hard to find
A new love, it's so hard to find
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus]
The night goes by
Leaving you behind me as I fly
Then rise the daylight sky
How do you get to heaven if you never try?
[Chorus]
New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another part in a different scene
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another part in a different scene
