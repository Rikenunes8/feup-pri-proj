[Intro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
[Verse 2]
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you
[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true
[Verse 3]
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
[Verse 4]
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you
[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true[Outro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
