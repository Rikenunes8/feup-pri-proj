[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Jon King]
Woke up this morning, desperation A.M
What I've been saying won't say them again
My head's not empty, it's full with my brain
The thoughts I'm thinking, like piss down a drain
[Verse 1: Andy Gill]
Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about, 'cause most groups
Make most of their songs about falling in love, or how happy they are
To be in love - you occasionally wonder why these groups
Do sing about it all the time, piss down a drain
[Chorus: Jon King]
And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
[Chorus 1: Andy Gill]
It's because these groups think there's something very special about it
Either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has
You know to burst into song, you have to be inspired
And nothing inspires quite like love
[Verse 2: Jon King]
Ought to control what I do to my mind
Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing aren't good for my health
[Verse 2: Andy Gill]
These groups and singers think that
They appeal to everyone by singing about love because apparently
Everyone has or can love, I said to myself
Or so they would have you believe anyway - But these groups
[Chorus: Jon King]
And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch[Chorus 2: Andy Gill]
Like a beetle on its back
To go along with what, the belief that love is deep in everyone's personality
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love, we just don't think that
What goes on between two people should be shrouded with mystery
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
