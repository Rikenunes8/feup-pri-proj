I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
(No, oh no) but I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved and
We've shared love and made love (well, well, well)
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
There's just not enough of it (oh, yeah, yeah)
There's just not enough
Oh oh, babe, my babe
My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
Just like the more you give, the more I want
And, baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe
Tell me, what can I say?
What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?
Girl, all I know is every time you're here
I feel the change, huh
Something moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doing
Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe
Girl, if only I could make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe
How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much
Girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do?
Because you blow my mind
I get the same old feeling every time you're here
I feel the change
Something moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doing
Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe
Baby, it didn't take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you
Oh oh, babe
Yeah, my darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh my darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh, darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
