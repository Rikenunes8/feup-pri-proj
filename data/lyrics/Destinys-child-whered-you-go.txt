[Intro: LaTavia / (Beyoncé) / *Destiny's Child*]
Oh baby, where'd you go?
I need you back wit' me
Oh baby, where'd you go?
I need you back wit' me, uh
(Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa
Where'd you go?)
*Where'd you go?* (Oh)
*Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa*
(Where'd you go?) *Oh-whoa* (Oh no)
*Whoa - so, baby, please come back to me* (Whoa, oh-oh)
*Oh-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa*
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It has been five days
You haven't called me
Do you still want me, still need me?
Am I on your mind?
Are you thinkin' of me?
Are you missin' me like I miss you?
Crying constantly?
Runnin' out the reasons
Why I haven't heard from you, I'm worried
Got me doin' crazy things
I can't even sleep
Gotta get you back to me
[Chorus: Destiny's Child / (Beyoncé)]
Where'd you go?
I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine (mi-mine-mi-mine)
So, baby, please
Come back to me (oh-ooh)
I know I can't live my life without you (I cannot live my life without you, baby)
Where'd you go? (oh-oh)
I don't know (I don't know)
I know that I need you in this heart of mine (oh-ooh, yeah, mi-mine-mine)
So, baby, please (please)
Come back to me (please, please)
I know I can't live my life without you (please, yeah-yeah yeah-yeah)[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Thinkin' of everything
That you told me
Said you'd never leave me, deceive me
Got my mind thrown off
Did you just use me?
Boy, you confuse me, gon' lose me
I can't deal with all the pain
And hell you put me through
'Cause I'm still missing you
I wanna be wit' you
Without you here, I'm breaking down inside
Oh baby, tell me why
Why did you hurt me, hurt me?
[Chorus: Destiny's Child / (Beyoncé)]
Where'd you go?
I don't know (oh-whoa-oh-ooh, oh)
I know that I need you in this heart of mine (need you in my, oh yeah-yeah baby)
So, baby, please (oh-oh ooh-ooh-ooh)
Come back to me (whoa-oh ooh-ooh)
I know I can't live my life without you (oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh yeah)
Where'd you go? (Yeah, where'd you go)
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
I know that I need you in this heart of mine (I don't know where to go)
So, baby, please (I need you, I need you)
Come back to me (I need you-ooh)
I know I can't live my life without you (I can't live my life without you)[Breakdown: Destiny's Child / (Beyonce)]
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa (oh)
Oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa)
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa (oh-whoa)
Whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa (Destiny's Child, help me out)
(It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me, yeah-yeah)
[Chorus: Destiny's Child / (Beyoncé)]
Where'd you go? (where'd you go?)

So, baby, please (where'd you go?)
