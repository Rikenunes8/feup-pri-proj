[Verse 1]
Send me some loving
Ooh send it I pray
How can I love you
When you're so far away?
[Verse 2]
Oh honey, send me your picture
Oh send it my dear
So I can hold it
And pretend you are here
[Verse 3]
Can you send me your kisses?
I still feel your touch
And oh I need you so badly
I want you so much
[Verse 4]
My days are so lonely
Whoa my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm alone
And I'm waiting for you
[Outro]
I want you to (send me some loving)
Oh send me some of that loving baby
(Send it I pray) Ooh, send it I pray
(How can I love you) How in the world can I love you?
(When you're so far away?) When you're so, so, so far away
(Send me your picture) Send me your picture baby
(Send it my dear) Oh send it my dear
(So I can hold it) Oh so that near to hold it
(And pretend that you're near) I wanna pretend that you're near
(Send me some loving) Send me loving, baby
(Send it I pray) Oh send it I pray
