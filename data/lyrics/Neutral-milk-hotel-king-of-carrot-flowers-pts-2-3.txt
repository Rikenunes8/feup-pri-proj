Part Two

I love you, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do
I love you, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do
And on the lazy days, the dogs dissolve and drain away
The world it goes and always waits
The day we are awaiting
Part Three

Up and over we go
Through the wave and undertow
I will float until I learn how to swim
Inside my mother in a garbage bin
Until I find myself again
Again, oh-oh-oh-oh

Up and over we go
Mouths open wide and spitting snow
I will spit until I learn how to speak
Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak
With them ever proclaiming me
Me, oh
Up and over we go
The weight it sits on down and I don't know
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine
Machine, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(Okay)
