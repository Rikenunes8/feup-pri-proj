[Verse 1]
I wanna go somewhere where nobody knows
I wanna know somewhere where nobody goes
Following gold lines on the ground, northbound, southbound
There's something 'bout the way I feel when the wheels go 'round and 'round and 'round
[Chorus 1]
Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way
Get off one and get on the other
Highway vagabonds
[Verse 2]
Daddy was a drifter, mama died young
I still don't know where I come from
On the map and off the grid with all my friends
Roaming town to town like Willie did when he was a kid, on the road again
[Chorus 2]
Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way, singing for your supper
Get off one and get on the other
Highway vagabonds
[Bridge]
But if we ain't broke down then we ain't doing something right
But if we ain't broke down then we ain't slowing down, goodnight
[Pre-Chorus]
Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
[Chorus 2]
Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way, singing for your supper
Get off one and get on the other
Highway vagabonds[Outro]
Highway vagabonds
Highway vagabonds
Living like hippies (Highway vagabonds)
Moving right along to the next big city
Living like hippies (Highway vagabonds)
Moving right along to the next big city (Highway vagabonds)
Living like highway vagabonds (Highway vagabonds)
