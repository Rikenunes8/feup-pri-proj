[Verse 1]
I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air
The walls of my room fade away in the blue
And I'm deep in a dream of you
[Verse 2]
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end
For we love a new just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you
[Bridge]
Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lover's refrain
You're so appealing that I'm soon revealing
My love for you over again
[Verse 3]
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep, every memory I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you
