[Verse 1]
You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free
You can shake me up
Or I can bring you down
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
[Verse 2]
You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you’ll never be free, no, no
You can shake me up
Or I can bring you down
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
Whoa!
[Verse 3]
You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you’ll never be free, no, no
You can shake me up
Or I can bring you down
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh[Chorus]
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
[Outro]
Whoa!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa!
