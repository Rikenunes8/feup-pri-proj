[Intro]
Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got you under their thumb
Hit it!
[Verse 1]
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb
[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond
[Verse 2]
Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And though you don't ask for pity
There's nothing that you can do, no no
[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond[Instrumental break 1:34-2:02]
[Verse 3]
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb
[Chorus]
Whoo, black diamond, yeah
Whoo, black diamond
[Instrumental outro 2:28-5:12]
