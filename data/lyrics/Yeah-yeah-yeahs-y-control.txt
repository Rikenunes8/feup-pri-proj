[Verse 1]
Oh, so all my lovin' goes
Under the fog, fog, fog
And I will leave them all
Well, I'm just a poor little baby
'Cause, well, I believe them all
[Verse 2]
Oh, so while you're growing old
Under the gun, gun, gun
And I believe them all
Well, I'm just one poor baby
'Cause, well, I believe them all
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could buy back
The woman you stole
[Chorus]
Y-control, Y-control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, out of control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, high control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, out of control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners out
[Verse 3]
Oh, so all my lovin' goes
Under the fog, fog, fog
And I believe them all
Well, I'm just a poor little baby
'Cause, well, I believe them all
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could buy back
The woman you stole
[Chorus]
Y-control, Y-control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, out of control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, high control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, out of control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners out
