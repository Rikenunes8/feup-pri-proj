List monitors arrive with petition
Iron-fisted philosophy...
Is your life worth a painting?
Is this 'girl vs. boy' with different symbols?
Being born is power
Scout leader nazi tagged as 'big sin'
Your risk chains me hostage
Me, I'm fighting with my head, I'm not ambiguous
I must look like a dork
Me, naked with textbook poems
Spout fountain against the Nazis
With weird kinds of sex symbols
In speeches that are big dance thumps
If we heard mortar shells
We'd cuss more in our songs
And cut down on guitar solos
(guitar solo)
So dig this big crux
Organizing the boy scouts for murder is wrong
Ten years beyond the big sweat point
Man, it was still there ever without you
Coming back around, look!
Coming together, for just a second
A peek, a guess
At the wholeness it's way too big
At the wholeness it's way too big
