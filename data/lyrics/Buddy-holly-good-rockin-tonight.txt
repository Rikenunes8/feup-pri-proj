[Verse 1]
Well I heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
Yeah I heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
I want to hold my baby as tight as I can
Well tonight she'll know I'm a mighty-mighty man
I heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
[Verse 2]
I want to meet you in a hurry behind the barn
Don't you be afraid you know I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring along my rocking shoes
'Cause tonight I want to rock away all your blues
I heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
[Chorus]
Well hey we're going to rock, we're going to rock
Hey hey let's rock
Come on and rock
We going to rock all our blues away
[Verse 3]
Have you heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
Have you heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
I want to hold my a-baby as tight as I can
Well tonight she'll know I'm a mighty-mighty man
I heard the news, there's a-good rocking tonight
[Instrumental Break]
Hey
[Chorus]
Well hey we're going to rock, we're going to rock
Hey hey let's rock
Come on and rock
We going to rock all our blues away
