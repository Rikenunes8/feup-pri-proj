[Verse 1]
Blue Monday, how I hate Blue Monday
Got to work like a slave all day
Here come Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday
I'm so tired that I've no time to play
[Verse 2]
Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks
My gal calls, and I tell her that I'm out
Because Thursday is a hard working day
And Friday I get my pay
[Verse 3]
Saturday morning, oh Saturday morning
All my tiredness has gone all away
Find my money meet my honey
And go out on the town to play
[Verse 4]
Sunday morning my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time that I've had
But I've got to get my rest
Because Monday is a mess
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Saturday morning, oh Saturday morning
All my tiredness has gone all away
Find my money meet my honey
And go out on the town to play
[Verse 4]
Sunday morning my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time that I've had
But I've got to get my rest
Because Monday is a mess
