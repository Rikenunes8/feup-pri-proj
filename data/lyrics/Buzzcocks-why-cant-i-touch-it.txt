[Verse 1]
Well, it seems so real, I can see it
And it seems so real, I can feel it
And it seems so real, I can taste it
And it seems so real, I can hear it
[Hook]
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
[Verse 2]
Then, it looks so real, I can see it
And it feels so real, I can feel it
And it tastes so real, I can taste it
And it sounds so real, I can hear it
[Hook]
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Then, it looks so real, I can feel it
And it feels so real, I can taste it
And it tastes so real, I can hear it
And it sounds so real, I can see it
[Hook]
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Now, it is so real, I can see it
And it is so real, I can feel it
And it is so real, I can hear it
And it is so real, I can be it
[Hook]
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?[Instrumental Outro]
