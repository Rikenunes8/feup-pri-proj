[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
You surely must know magic girl
Because you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright
[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see, girl
Just knowin' your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin' in on me, girl
[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
Baby, you're part of every thought I think each day
Your name is in every phrase my lips say
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldn't live without you
[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks and 
David Ruffin
]
Baby (
Baby
), baby (
Baby
), baby
You're my everything, you're my everything, yes you are
(You're my everything, girl)
[Verse 4: Eddie Kendricks]
You're the girl I sing about
In every love song I sing
(You're my everything)
You're my winter baby
My summer, my fall and spring
(You're my everything)[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks and 
David Ruffin
]
You're my everything, you're my everything, yes you are
(
When my way was dark, and troubles were near, don't you know baby, that you're my everything
)
(Don't you know you're my everything)
You're my everything, you're my everything
(Don't you know you're my everything)
You're my everything, you're my everything
