[Verse 1]
You, 
in your Lark
You're a mark
You're a screamer
You know how to hustle
Daddy is a rare millionaire
I don't care
Yeah, you got the muscle
I got the news
[Chorus]
Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow
[Verse 2]
Take it in your hand
All the sirens and the band
Get to bendin' my ear
How was I to know
About the warm
Soulful secret
You been keepin' for years
I got the news
[Chorus]
Slow down I'll tell you when
I may never walk again
[Verse 3]
Broadway Duchess
Darling if you only knew
Half as much as
Everybody thinks you do
What I hear may be true
I would still be proud
To know you
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Spanish kissin'
See it glisten
You came ragin'
Love rampagin'[Chorus]
I got the news
Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow
