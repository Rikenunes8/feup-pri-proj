Forty Nine reasons all in a line
All of them good ones, all of them lies
Driftin' with my lady, we're oldest of friends
Need a little work and there's fences to mend

Steady girl, be my world (Steady girl)
Till the drifter come, now she's gone (Be my world)
I let that man play his hand (Drifter come)
I let them go, how was I to know this? (Now you're gone)
I'm down on my knees
Nobody left to please
Now it's over, they left in the spring
Her and the drifter, looking for beautiful things

Steady girl, be my world (Steady girl)
Till the drifter come, now she's gone  (Be my world)
I let that man play his hand (Drifter come)
I let them go, how was I to know? (Now you're gone)
I'm down on my knees
Nobody left to please

On my knees
Feeling wrong
Mama's gone
Oh, oh

Bye bye baby (Bye bye baby)
Write if you think of it, maybe
Know I love you (Know I love you)
Go if it means that much to you

Hey, but you can run, baby
If the feeling's wrong before too long it's crazy
And you're trapped, babe
And you know that's not where it's at, baby
You're just seein' things through a cat's eye, baby
That's not my old lady
Come on and tell me, baby
You better tell me, baby
Who do you, who do you love?
Time will tell us
Who is trying to sell us
Bye, bye, baby (Bye, bye, bye, bye, baby)
Write if you think of it, maybe

Hey, but you can run, baby
If the feeling's wrong, before too long it's crazy
And you're trapped babe
And you know that's not where it's at baby
You're just seein' things through a cat's eye, baby
That's not my old lady
Come on and tell me, baby
You better tell me, baby
Who do you, who do you love?
