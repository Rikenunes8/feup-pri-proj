[Verse 1]
Lonesome Suzie
Never got the breaks
She's always losing
And so she sits and cries and shakes
It's hard just to watch her
And if I touch her
Oh, poor Suzie
I'm wondering what to do
[Verse 2]
She just sits there
Hoping for a friend
I don't fit here
But I may have a friend to lend
Maybe I mistook her
But I can't overlook her
Must be someone
Who can pull her through
[Bridge]
Anyone who's felt that bad
Could tell me what to say
Even if she'd just get mad
She might be better off that way
And where is all the understanding?
Her problems can't be that demanding
Why is it she looks my way
Every time she starts to cry?
[Verse 3]
Lonesome Suzie
I can't watch you cry no longer
If you can use me
Until you feel a little stronger
I guess just watching you
Has made me lonesome too
Why don't we get together?
What else can we do?
