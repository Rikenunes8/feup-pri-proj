[Verse 1]
You taught me how to love with all my heart
With all my soul I trusted you
And now you say we have to live apart
A thing I don't know how to do
[Chorus]
You say someday I'll find somebody new
And I'll have not one regret
Stay awhile if what you say is true
Stay and teach me to forget
[Verse 2]
You taught me how to worship you alone
And now you say that you must go
And people call me on the telephone
Just to say I told you so
[Chorus]
You say someday I'll find somebody new
And I'll have not one regret
Stay awhile if what you say is true
Stay and teach me to forget
Stay and teach me to forget
