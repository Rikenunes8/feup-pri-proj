[Chorus]
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?
[Verse]
Tell me scarlet sun
What will time allow?
We have brought our children here
Who can save them now?
Oh, Weeping woman try to smile
Like the coming dawn
Most of us are sad it's true
Still we must go on
Love was here today
Oh the sun was bright
I will sing you far away
Love is here tonight
[Chorus]
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?
