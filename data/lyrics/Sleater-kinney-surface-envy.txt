[Verse 1]
Throw me a rope, give me a leg
I haven't seen daylight in what must be days
I took the long way down, lost track of myself
Confidence fell down the steepest of slopes
But if you get me a line, lend me an oar
I'll row you an ocean,  I could do more
I feel so much stronger now that you're here
We've got so much to do, let me make that clear
[Chorus]
We win, we lose
Only together do we break the rules
We win, we lose
Only together do we make the rules
[Verse 2]
I'm breaking the surface, tasting the air
Reaching for things that I could never before
The anchor is heavy, I can't hold the weight
The guilt holds me down, won't let me be myself
Suck it all in, suck it all up
Let go of thoughts that are holding me back
I push twice as hard towards it you see
And the past falls away to the bottom of the deep
[Chorus]
We win, we lose
Only together do we break the rules
We win, we lose
Only together do we make the rules
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
We win, we lose
Only together do we break the rules
We win, we lose
Only together do we make the rules
[Outro]
When we leave say goodbye to your old way of life
I can breathe way up high, now itâ€™s our turn to fly
