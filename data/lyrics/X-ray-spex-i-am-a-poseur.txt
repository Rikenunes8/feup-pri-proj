[Chorus]
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
[Verse 1]
Exhibition is the name
Voyeurism is the game
Stereoscopic is the show
Viewing time makes it grow
(Grow, grow, grow, gro-ow)
[Chorus]
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
[Verse 2]
My fa√ßade is just a fake
Shock horror no escape
Sensationalism for the feed
Caricatures are what you breed (Breed, breed, breed, bree-eed)
[Chorus]
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare[Chorus]
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
[Verse 1]
Anti-art was the start
Establishments like a laugh
Yes we're very entertaining
Overtones can be betraying
('traying, 'traying, 'traying, 'tray-ing)
[Chorus]
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
[Chorus]
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
