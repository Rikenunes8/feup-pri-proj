[Intro]
Ooh, la, la, la, la
[Verse 1]
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
I'm cryin'
[Chorus]
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
[Verse 2]
Mistakes, I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too
I'm cryin'
[Chorus]
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
[Bridge]
I'm just about at the end of my rope
But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope[Verse 3]
'Cause I'll be here
One day I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
I'm cryin'
[Chorus]
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
[Outro]
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh, Ooh
Baby, baby
Oohoo
