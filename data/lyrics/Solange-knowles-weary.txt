I'm weary of the ways of the world
Be weary of the ways of the world
I'm weary of the ways of the world

I'm gonna look for my body, yeah
I'll be back like real soon
I'm gonna look for my body, yeah
I'll be back like real soon
I'm gonna look for my body, yeah
I'll be back like real soon
But you know that a king is only a man
With flesh and bones, he bleeds just like you do
He said, "Where does that leave you?"
And, "Do you belong?"
I do, I do

Be leery 'bout your place in the world
You're feeling like you're chasing the world
You're leaving not a trace in the world
But you're facing the world

I'm gonna look for my glory, yeah
I'll be back like real soon
I'm gonna look for my glory, yeah
I'll be back like real soon
I'm gonna look for my glory, yeah
I'll be back like real soon

But you know that a king is only a man
With flesh and bones, he bleeds just like you do
He said, "Where does that leave you?"
And, "Do you belong?"
I do, I do
Woah
Oh, woah
