Ooh

I used to wake up in the morning
I'd always to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad, he said
"Son, now, here's some little somethings"
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact, I don't feel bad at all
I don't feel bad at all (It really was)
Pictures of Lily, they made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily, they let me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily, they solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily, they make me feel alright

Pictures of Lily (Pictures of Lily)
Pictures of Lily (Lily, oh Lily)
Pictures of Lily (Lily, oh Lily)
Pictures of Lily (Pictures of Lily)
Pictures of Lily, pictures of Lily
Pictures of Lily, pictures of Lily

And thеn one day, things weren't quitе so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said, "Don't be silly
She's been dead since 1929"
How I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright (There were always)

Pictures of Lily to help me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily to help me feel alright
'Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams
Hey, I was wondering, mister, have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily to help me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily to help me feel alright
'Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams
Hey, I was wondering, mister, have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily
