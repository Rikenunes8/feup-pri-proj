[Verse 1]
Try and breathe some life into a letter
Losing hope, we'll never be together
My courage is at its peak
You know what I mean
[Chorus]
How do you say you're okay to an answering machine?
How do you say good night to an answering machine?
[Verse 2]
Big town's got its losers
Small town's got its vices
A handful of friends:
One needs a match, one needs some ice
Call-waiting phone
 in another time zone
[Chorus]
How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do say good night to an answering machine?
[Bridge]
(
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, hang up and then dial the number...
)
I get enough of that
[Verse 3]
Try and free a slave of ignorance
Try and teach a whore about romance
[Chorus]
How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do you say good night to an answering machine?
How do you say I'm lonely to an answering machine?
[Outro]
The message is very plain
Oh, I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...)
