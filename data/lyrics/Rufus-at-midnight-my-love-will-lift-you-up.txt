[Verse 1: Chaka Khan]
You said you won't
I bet my neck, I bet you will
I'm gonna check my love
You I'm gonna thrill
You can't imagine what you've missed
Can't go on
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love
[Chorus: Rufus]
Since there was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of going on
I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up
[Bridge: Chaka Khan]
You came into my life and now I realize
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus: Rufus]
Since there was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of going on
I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up
[Bridge: Chaka Khan]
You came into my life and now I realize
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight
[Outro: Rufus]
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight, midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight, midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight, midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight, midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight, midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight, midnight
