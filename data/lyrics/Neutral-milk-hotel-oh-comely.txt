[Verse 1]
Oh comely
I will be with you when you lose your breath
Chasing the only
Meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty, bright and bubbly
Terrible scene that was doing her thing on your chest
But, oh comely
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory, you're drunk on your awe to me
It doesn't mean anything at all
[Verse 2]
Oh comely
All of your friends are all letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty, bright and bubbly
Friend you could need to say comforting things in your ear
But, oh comely
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
Standing next to me, he's only my enemy
I'll crush him with everything I own
[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me
[Verse 3]
Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies
While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
And soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful, all in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me
[Bridge]
Do do do, do do do, do
Do do do, do do do, do
Do do do, do do do, do
[Verse 4]
I know they buried her body with others
Her sister and mother and five-hundred families
And will she remember me fifty years later?
I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
[Bridge]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la la la la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la la la la
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee[Verse 5]
Goldaline, my dear
We will fold and freeze together
Far away from here
There is sun and spring and green forever
But now we move to feel
For ourselves inside some stranger's stomach
Place your body here
Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine
[Outro]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la la la la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la la la la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
"Holy shit!"
