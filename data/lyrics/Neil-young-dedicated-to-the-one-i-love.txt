One day shots rang across the peaceful valley
God was crying tears that fell like rain
Before the railroad came from Kansas City
And the bullets hit the bison from the train
First shots rang across the peaceful valley
And the white man laid his foot upon the plain
The wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon
The settlers full of wonder as they crossed
A gentle creek where two old oaks were standing
Before the west was won there was a cost
A rain of fire came down upon the wagons
A mother screamed and every soul was lost
Change hit the country like a thunderstorm
Ancient rivers soon began to boil
People rushed like water to California
At first they came for gold and then for oil
Fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes
Mother earth took poison in her soil
An Electra Cruiser coasted towards the exit
And turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard
"People make the difference" read a billboard
Above a long line of idling cars
Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead the nations
And protect God's creations
A polar bear was drifting on an ice floe
Sun beating down from the sky
Politicians gathered for a summit
And came away with nothing to decide
Storms thundered on, his tears of falling rain
A child was born and wondered why
