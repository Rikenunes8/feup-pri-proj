I know it's hard sometimes
And things seem larger than they are
But if you need to tell someone
That's what I'm here for
Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you rise above
Cry on my shoulder, my love
Out in the world outside
It can be harsh and cold
But if you need someone
I will be here to hold you
Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you dry your eyes
Cry on my shoulder, my love
I know it's hard sometimes
And things seem larger than they are
But if you need to let it go
Then you can call on me
Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you dry your eyes
Cry on my shoulder, my love
Cry on my shoulder
I'll help you rise above
Cry on my shoulder, my love
My love...
