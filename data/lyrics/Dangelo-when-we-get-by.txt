[Verse 1]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
I look in your eyes, when I look in your eyes
I know what you're thinking of
'Tis a beautiful day, and you're welcome to stay (Welcome to stay)
We can spend some time and catch the matinee (Matinee)
Sugar, you're so fine, and the day is fine
And we'll be fine
When we make it by and we get by with love

[Verse 2]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes
They're pretty as the skies above (Everything, everything, everything)
Everything, everything, everything is okay
We could make love in the shade
Sip some chocolate lemonade
Sugar, you're so fine, and the journey's fine
And we'll be fine
When we make it by and we get by with love

You scratch mine, and I'll scratch your back
Sugar, you're so fine, and the journey's fine
And we'll be fine
