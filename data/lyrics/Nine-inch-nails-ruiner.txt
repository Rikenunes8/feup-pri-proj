[Verse 1]
You had all of them on your side
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left
In my fucking world is wearing your disease
[Chorus 1]
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
[Verse 2]
You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you?  Didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know[Chorus 2]
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
And what you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop--
