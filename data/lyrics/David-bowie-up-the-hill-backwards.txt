[Verse 1]
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
[Chorus]
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it
[Verse 2]
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling, witnesses falling
[Chorus 1]
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
up the hill backwards
It'll be alright
, ooh-ooh
[Verse 3]
While we sleep, they go to work
We're legally crippled, it's the death of love
[Chorus]
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it
[Bridge]
More idols than realities
, ooh-ooh
I'm OK, you're so-so
, ooh-ooh
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, up the hill backwards
It'll be alright, ooh-ooh
