[Verse 1]
You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turn into a shining band of gold
[Chorus]
I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger
[Verse 2]
Mephistopheles
 is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition
[Chorus]
I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger
[Verse 3]
Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air, you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master
[Outro]
Oh, you'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
Ohh
