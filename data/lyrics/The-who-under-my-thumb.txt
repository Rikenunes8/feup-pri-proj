[Verse 1]
Under my thumb, the girl (Under my thumb)
Who once had me down
Under my thumb, the girl (Under my thumb)
Who once pushed me around
[Chorus]
It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
[Verse 2]
Under my thumb, this squirming dog
Who's just had her day
Under my thumb, this girl
Who has just changed her ways
[Chorus]
It's down to me
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
[Chorus]
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
[Verse 3]
Under my thumb, this Siamese
Cat of a girl
Under my thumb, she's the sweetest
Pet in the world
[Chorus]
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb[Outro]
Yes, she's under my thumb
Babe, she's under my thumb
Yes, she's under my thumb
