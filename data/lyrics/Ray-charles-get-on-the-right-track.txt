Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Yeah, come on home and treat me wrong again

Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Yeah, come on home and treat me wrong again

Yeah, I've been so blue and lonely
I've cried both night and day
But I'm begging you just one more time
Come back, if you don't stay

Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Yeah, come on home and treat me wrong again

Yeah, I know you know I love you
But yet you broke my heart in two
But it's because I love you
That I don't care what you do
Get on the right track, baby
You better come on now
Get on the right track, baby
Yeah, come on home and treat me wrong again

Well, I'm begging you one more time, baby
Down on bended knees
Please, please come back home
And give my poor heart ease

Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Yeah, come on home and treat me wrong one more again
(that's what I said now)
