[verse 1]
You took my arm and you broke my will
You made me shiver with a real thrill
You took my arm and we walked along
Down the road to a quiet song
[verse 2]
I looked into your cool, cool eyes
I felt so fine, I felt so fine
I floated in your swimming pools
I felt so weak, I felt so blue
[bridge]
Ann, my Ann
I love you
Ann, my Ann
I love you right now!
