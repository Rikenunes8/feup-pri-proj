[Chorus]
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less
[Verse 1]
Love me with a tender touch
Kindness, I need very much
It is so hard for me to trust
But deep inside I know I must
[Pre-Chorus]
Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll play with you
Please be gentle
[Chorus]
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less
[Verse 2]
Love me
Try to be understanding
Tenderness is all that I'm asking
Don't feel like I'm making conditions
I wanna to overcome my inhibitions
[Pre-Chorus]
Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll play with you
Please be gentle[Chorus]
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less
[Verse 1]
Love me with a tender touch
Kindness, I need very much
It is so hard for me to trust
But deep inside I know I must
[Pre-Chorus]
Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll play with you
Please be gentle
[Bridge]
Love me
Kindness
Love me
Hug me
Please be gentle[Chorus]
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less
[Outro]
Try to be understanding
