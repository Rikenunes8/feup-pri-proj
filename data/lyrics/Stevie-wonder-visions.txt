[Verse 1]
People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a 
vision in my mind
?
[Verse 2]
The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they are truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind?
[Chorus]
I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending
[Verse 3]
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind?
[Chorus]
I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending
[Verse 3]
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the visions in our minds?
