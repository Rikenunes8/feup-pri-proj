[Verse 1]
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead, but I sail away
[Chorus]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave
[Verse 2]
I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Ni√±o
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana
[Chorus]
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave
