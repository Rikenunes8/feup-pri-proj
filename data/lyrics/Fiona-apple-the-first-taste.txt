[Verse 1]
I lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts
Waiting for the black to replace my blue
I do not struggle in your web
Because it was my aim to get caught
But daddy longlegs, I feel
That I'm finally growing weary
Of waiting to be consumed by you
[Chorus]
Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor
[Verse 2]
Oh, your love give me a heart contusion
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
And I'm building memories
On things we have not said
[Breakdown]
Full is not heavy as empty
Not nearly my love
Not nearly my love
Not nearly
[Chorus]
Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor
[Outro]
The first taste
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever
Start the chase, I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor
