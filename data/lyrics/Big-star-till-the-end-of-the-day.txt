Baby, I feel good
From the moment I arise
Feel good from morning
Till the end of the day
You and me, we live a life
From when we get up
Till we go through the night
You and me, we're free, yeah
We do as we please, yeah
From morning till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Yeah, I get up, I see the sun
And I feel good, yeah
'Cause my life has begun
You and me, we're free, yeah
We do as we please, yeah
From morning till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
You and me, we're free, yeah
We do as we please, yeah
From morning till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
