Are you all right?
All of a sudden you went away
Are you all right?
I hope you come back around someday
Are you all right?
I haven't seen you in a real long time
Are you all right?
Could you give me some kind of sign?
Are you all right?
I looked around me and you were gone
Are you all right?
I feel like there must be something wrong
Are you all right?
Cause it seems like you disappeared
Are you all right?
Cause I've been feeling a little scared
Are you all right?
Are you sleeping through the night?
Do you have someone to hold you tight?
Do you have someone to hang out with?
Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?
Hug and kiss you
Hug and kiss you
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Is there something been bothering you?
Are you all right?
I wish you'd give me a little clue
Are you all right?
Is there something you want to say?
Are you all right?
Just tell me that you're OK
Are you all right?
Cause you took off without a word
Are you all right?
You flew away like a little bird
Are you all right?
Is there anything I can do?
Are you all right?
Cause I need to hear from you
Are you all right?Are you sleeping through the night?
Do you have someone to hold you tight?
Do you have someone to hang out with?
Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?
Hug and kiss you
Hug and kiss you
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
