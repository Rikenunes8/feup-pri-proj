[Verse 1]
Baby, baby
Been a long, long time
Been a long, long time
Been a long, long time
I was wrong, girl, and you were right
[Verse 2]
Baby, baby
Took a long, long while
Took a long, long while
Took a long, long while
But I found out you were right
[Bridge]
Still you have those happy eyes
I will try and apologize
[Verse 3]
Baby, baby
Still the same old smile
Still the same old smile
Still the same old smile
I was so wrong, girl, and you were right
[Bridge]
Still you have those happy eyes, yes
But I, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try and apologize, oh[Verse 3]
Baby, baby
Been a long, long time
Been a long, long time
Been a long, long time
I was wrong girl and you were right, oh
[Verse 4]
Baby, baby
Won't you change your mind?
Won't you change your mind?
Won't you change your mind?
I was wrong girl, but not this, no
[Verse 5]
I, I said, baby, baby
Been a long, long time
It's been such a long and lonely time, girl
It's been such a long, a long, long time
I was wrong, but I admit, I admit you were right
[Verse 6]
Oh c'mon now, baby, baby
I just wanted to change your mind
I wanted to change your mind, baby
I wanted to come on and change your mind
I was wrong, I, I, I, oh
