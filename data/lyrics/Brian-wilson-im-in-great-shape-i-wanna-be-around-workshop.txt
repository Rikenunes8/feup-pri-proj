[I'm in Great Shape]
[Verse]
Fresh, clean air around my head
Morning, tumble out of bed
Eggs and grits and lickety-split
Look at me jump!
I'm in the great shape of the agriculture
[I Wanna Be Around]
[Verse]
I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart (your heart)
Yes when somebody breaks your heart (your heart)
In two (in two)
