[Intro]
It's been a while
I know I shouldn't've kept you waiting
But I'm here now
[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So, let me get it up
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying
[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
[Interlude]
So, are you warming up yet?
[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying
[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
[Interlude]
I like this part, oh
It feels kinda good
Yeah
[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot (Hot)[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
