[Verse 1]
I know you
I care too
I see through
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall
All of the people that will come to the ball
[Chorus]
But hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
Hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
[Verse 2]
I know, too
What you do
When you're through
Counting the cattle as they go by the door
Keeping the carpet that's so thick on the floor
[Chorus]
But hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
Hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
[Verse 3]
I know you
I care too
I see through
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall
All of the people that will come to the ball
[Chorus]
But hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride?
Hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride?
