[Verse 1: Eric Church]
Yeah I see you over there making' eyes at me
Like you don't want to get caught
Now where'd you get the cowboy on your arm
And where you want me to drop him off
I see you trying' to hide that fire inside
But your hold me back's almost gone
Yeah it's about time I let cowboy know
That I'm a going to take you home
[Chorus: Eric Church]
Yeah so keep on looking' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can tell you what I got here on my mind
But I think you already know
Yeah and now's the time for you to turn around
If you want me to walk away
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
(Po-po-po-po-po-po-pooopoo)
[Verse 2: Eric Church]
Yeah I can tell by the way I took your hand
And then asked you to dance
He went all John Wayne in front of his friends
And said I don't think so man
Yeah all blowed up like a loud mouth pup
Never been in a junkyard fight
But if you're going to bark at the big dog boy
Then you're going to get to feel the bite
[Chorus: Eric Church]
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can finish sweepin' her off her pretty little feet
And your buddies can carry you home
You can back off and let her dance with me
And live to fight another day
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
(Po-po-po-po-po-po-pooopoo)
[Verse 3: Eric Church]
Yeah I love the way the sun's coming' through
And bouncing' off the small of your back
Yeah I know if I call in sick today
Boss man will have a heart attack
Yeah I knew it was over when she rolled over
And said baby why don't you stay
And keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on looking' at me that way
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on looking' at me that
Looking' at me that, looking' at me that way
