Hey, come back Jonee
Gotta come back now, Jonee
Hey, come back, Jonee
Jonee be good
Treat her like you should
You made her cry
Jonee, you're bad
You're gonna make her sad
Jonee went to the pawnshop
Bought himself a guitar
Now he's gonna go far
You gotta love 'em and leave ‘em
Sometimes you deceive ‘em
You made her cry
Jonee, you're bad
You're gonna make her sad
With eyes full of teardrops
Jonee jumped in his Datsun
Drove out on the expressway
Went head-on into a semi
His guitar is all that's left now
He made her cry
And she calls his name
Jonee, you're to blame
Come back JoneeHey, come back Jonee
You've gotta come back now, Jonee, Jonee, Jonee
Hey, come back Jonee
Oh, Jonee be good
Treat her like you should
You made her cry
Jonee you're bad
You're gonna make her sad
Come back Jonee
Well, come back Jonee
(Jonee, Jonee)
Jonee, Jonee, Jonee
(Jonee, Jonee)
You gotta come back now, Jonee
(Jonee, Jonee)
Well, Jonee be good
(Jonee, Jonee)
Treat her like you should
(Jonee, Jonee)
You made her cry
(Jonee, Jonee)
Well, Jonee you're bad
(Jonee, Jonee)
You're gonna make her sad
(Jonee, Jonee)Jonee, Jonee
Jonee, Jonee
Jonee, Jonee
Jonee, Jonee
Jonee, Jonee
Jonee, Jonee
