[Verse 1]
I got a kind hearted Mama
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kind hearted Mama
Do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women
Man, they will not let me be
[Verse 2]
I love my baby
My baby don't love me
I love my baby, oooh
My baby don't love me
But I really love that woman
Can't stand to leave her be
[Bridge]
A-ain't but the one thing
Makes Mister Johnson drink
I's worried 'bout how you treat me, baby
I begin to think
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart
When you call Mister So-and-So's name
[Verse 3]
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You well's to kill me
As to have it on your mind
