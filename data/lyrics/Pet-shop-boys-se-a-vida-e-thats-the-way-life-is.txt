[Verse 1]
Come outside and see a brand new day
The troubles in your mind will blow away
It's easy to believe they're here to stay
But you won't find them standing in your way
[Chorus]
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Come outside and feel the morning sun
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Life is much more simple when you're young
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
[Post-Chorus]
Come on, 
essa vida é
That's the way life is
That's the way life is
[Verse 2]
Although we see the world through different eyes
We share the same idea of paradise
So don't search in the stars for signs of love
Look around your life, you'll find enough
[Chorus]
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Come outside and feel the morning sun
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Life is much more simple when you're young
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
[Post-Chorus]
Come on, 
essa vida é
That's the way life is
That's the way life is[Bridge]
Why do you want to sit alone in gothic gloom
Surrounded by the ghosts of love that haunt your room?
Somewhere there's a different door to open wide
You gotta throw those skeletons out of your closet and come outside
[Verse 3]
So you will see a brand new day
The troubles in your mind will blow away
It's easy to believe they're here to stay
But you won't find them standing in your way
[Chorus]
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Come outside and feel the morning sun
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Life is much more simple when you're young
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
[Post-Chorus]
Come on, 
essa vida é
That's the way life is
That's the way life is
Come on, 
essa vida é
That's the way life is
That's the way life is[Chorus]
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Come outside and feel the morning sun
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
Se a vida é, I love you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Life is much more simple when you're young
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
Se a vida...
