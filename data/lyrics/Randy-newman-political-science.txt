[Verse 1]
No one likes us, I don't know why
We may not be perfect, but heaven knows we try
And all around, even our old friends put us down
Let's drop the big one, see what happens
[Verse 2]
We give them money, but are they grateful?
No, they're spiteful and they're hateful
They don't respect us, so let's surprise them
We'll drop the big one and pulverize them
[Verse 3]
Asia's crowded
, Europe's too old
Africa is far too hot, and Canada's too cold
And South America stole our name
Let's drop the big one, there'll be no one left to blame us
[Bridge]
We'll save Australia
Don't wanna hurt no kangaroos
We'll build an all-American amusement park there
They got surfing too!
[Verse 4]
Boom goes London, boom Paris
More room for you, and more room for me
And every city, the whole world 'round
Will just be another American town
Oh, how peaceful it'll be
We'll set everybody free
You wear a Japanese kimono, babe
There'll be Italian shoes for me
[Outro]
They all hate us anyhow
So let's drop the big one now
Let's drop the big one now
